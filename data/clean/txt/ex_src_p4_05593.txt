Molothrus ater artemisiae Grinnell.--This subspecies of the Brown-headed Cowbird is an uncommon
migrant in Coahuila. Amadon and Phillips (1947:579) obtained, at Las Delicias, a juvenile male
on August 15 and an adult male on August 17.

This subspecies of the Brown-headed Cowbird is common in Coahuila and breeds there. Amadon
and Phillips (1947:579) suggested that M. a. obscurus breeds at Las Delicias. Burleigh and
Lowery (1942:206) saw the Brown-headed Cowbird in "small numbers on the outskirts of Saltillo...."

Measurements of the adult males that I have examined are: wing, 101.1 mm. (97-106); tail, 66.5
mm. (62-69); tarsus, 25.6 mm. (24.5-28); culmen, 17.3 mm. (16-18.5). Measurements of the adult
females that I have examined are: wing, 92.3 mm. (90-97); tail, 60.1 mm. (56.5-62.5); tarsus,
23.5 mm. (22.5-24); culmen, 14.4 mm. (14-15). The sizes of the testes of three of the males
(6-7 mm. long) and of the largest ova of four of the females (6-9 mm. in diameter) indicate
breeding by this subspecies in Coahuila, as does the small size of one of the juvenile males
(tail, 33.5 mm. long).

Piranga ludoviciana (Wilson).--In Coahuila the Western Tanager occurs fairly commonly as a
migrant. There are no records of it breeding in the State. Miller (1955a:174) remarked that
Marsh took a migrant Western Tanager at Jardín del Sur in the Sierra del Carmen on September
7. Amadon and Phillips (1947:579) took an adult male Western Tanager at Las Delicias on August
12. Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:305) also recorded this tanager from 12 mi.
W Saltillo.

Miller (1955a:174) found this subspecies of the Hepatic Tanager "in the pine-oak belt at 7000
feet on April 12 [in the Sierra del Carmen], when a male was seen and a female taken." No.
31526 was with a female when taken; this male was not fat and its testes were not enlarged.
The size of the wing (105.5 mm.) of No. 31526 represents the extreme maximum in this subspecies.

Piranga flava hepatica (Swainson).--Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:303) stated
that P. f. hepatica is found in northwestern and central Arizona and southwestern New Mexico
south into the highlands of México, west of the Sierra Madre Oriental, to Oaxaca and in winter
and migration extends eastward and south to Chiapas. These authors remarked also that P. f.
dextra occurs in the mountains east of the continental divide in New Mexico and western Texas
south through eastern México to Chiapas. Specimens of the Hepatic Tanager from Coahuila in
winter might well be either P. f. hepatic or P. f. dextra. Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and
Moore (loc. cit.) recorded migrants of P. f. hepatica from the Sierra de Guadalupe on April 24-27.

This Summer Tanager occurs in northeastern Coahuila. The specimens from 12 mi. N and 12 mi.
W Jiménez, 2 mi. W Jiménez, and 2 mi. S and 11 mi. E Nava are typical representatives of P.
r. rubra. The large testes (12 mm.) of No. 32129 and the well-developed brood patch of No.
32134 are evidence of breeding by this subspecies in the State. Heretofore this subspecies
has not been recorded from Coahuila.

*Piranga rubra cooperi Ridgway.--Specimens examined: total 4: [Male] [Male] 32828-32829, [Male]
32831, and [Female] 32830 from Parras, July 4, 1955.

This subspecies of Summer Tanager seems to occur throughout Coahuila except in the northeastern
section of the State. Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:302) listed P. r. cooperi
from Sabinas and Sierra de Guadalupe. Miller (1955a:174) saw a Summer Tanager in a canyon in
the Serranías de Burros, about 40 miles east of the Sierra del Carmen on April 28. Although
there are no other records of P. r. cooperi from northwestern Coahuila, Van Tyne and Sutton
(1937:96) recorded this tanager as a common nesting species in Brewster County, Texas, in cottonwood,
mesquite, or willow trees. I suspect that P. r. cooperi is a common nesting bird in northwestern
Coahuila as well.

Nos. 32828-32831 approach P. r. rubra. The measurements of No. 32829 are: wing, 98 mm.; tail,
80 mm.; the measurements of No. 32831 are: wing, 98 mm.; tail, 79 mm. The specimens of P. r.
cooperi from Parras are somewhat small and seemingly approach P. r. rubra. The sizes of the
testes (8×5 mm.; 9×5 mm.) of Nos. 32829 and 32831, respectively, and the size of the largest
ovum (4×4 mm.) of No. 32830 indicate breeding by this subspecies in southern Coahuila, as does
the presence of No. 32828, a juvenile male. Miller (1955a:174) found it singing in the Boquillas
drainage of the Sierra del Carmen at 4800 feet, and gave evidence that the Cardinal breeds
there. Sutton and Burleigh (1939a:43) found the species to be common in the low country "east
of Saltillo." Hellmayr (1938:69) recorded R. c. canicaudus from Sabinas. The sizes of the testes
(9 mm.; 7×4 mm.) of Nos. 32135-32136 indicate breeding by this subspecies in northeastern Coahuila.

In Coahuila, the Pyrrhuloxia is common. Hellmayr (1938:76) listed it from Sabinas. Ridgway
(1901:628) recorded P. s. texana (=sinuata) from La Ventura. Burleigh and Lowery (1942:206)
found the species "only in the open desert country west of Saltillo where, on April 22, several
pairs were seen in a small arroyo." Amadon and Phillips (1947:579) took an immature P. s. sinuata
at Las Delicias; Sutton and Burleigh (1939a:43-44) found this subspecies fairly common in the
San Pedro district on January 29 and 30. Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:330) recorded
breeding by P. s. sinuata at Hipólito on July 2. The size of the testes (8 mm.) of No. 32137
indicates breeding in central Coahuila.

Miller (1955a:174) reported that the Black-headed Grosbeak first appeared in the Sierra del
Carmen on April 13 and was soon seen patrolling territories. He remarked that these specimens
from the Sierra del Carmen conformed adequately with the rather poorly differentiated race
P. m. melanocephalus and stated that Marsh took an immature male at Jardín del Sur on September
7. Oberholser (1919b:416) listed Hedymeles melanocephalus papago (=P. m. melanocephalus) from
Sierra Guadalupe on April 27. The size of No. 31664 represents the characters of P. m. melanocephalus
as presented by Oberholser (1919b:413). No specimen of P. m. melanocephalus from Coahuila,
to my knowledge, approaches P. m. maculatus. The size of the testes (7×5 mm.) of No. 31664
suggests breeding by this subspecies in the Sierra Guadalupe.

Burleigh and Lowery (1942:206) recorded this Blue Grosbeak from "about twenty miles west of
Saltillo" on April 22. Miller (1955a:174) stated that Marsh obtained a male G. c. interfusa
at Vivoras Spring on August 3. Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:334) remarked that
the Blue Grosbeak breeds in the northern and eastern sections and reported G. c. interfusa
from Hipólito on July 2. Amadon and Phillips (1947:580) reported examining material from Sabinas
referable to G. c. interfusa. Dickerman saw Blue Grosbeaks 4 mi. N San Isidro on May 10, 1954.
Nos. 32138-32139 are typical representatives of G. c. interfusa. The size of the testes (12
mm.) of No. 32138, the size of the largest ovum (2 mm.) of No. 32139, and the dates (June 18,
21) on which they were collected are evidence of breeding by this subspecies.

**Guiraca caerulea eurhyncha Coues.--Amadon and Phillips (1947:580) obtained an adult male
of this Blue Grosbeak from Las Delicias on August 12. This subspecies, according to Miller,
Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:334), is resident at middle and lower elevations through
most of central and southern México. Except for the occurrence of intergrades of G. c. interfusa,
caerulea, and eurhyncha in southern Nuevo León and Tamaulipas (Miller, Friedmann, Griscom,
and Moore, 1957:335), the record from Las Delicias represents the northern limit of the range
of the subspecies eurhyncha.

*Passerina cyanea (Linnaeus).--Specimen examined: one, [Male] 31544, from San Marcos, May 5, 1954.

The Indigo Bunting is rare in Coahuila. Van Hoose (1955:303) reported that No. 31544 seems
to provide the first record of the species in the State. The Indigo Bunting is a summer resident
in southwestern Oklahoma and southeastern Texas (Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore, 1957:336).
No. 31544 seemingly represents a large extension in the summer range of the Indigo Bunting.
Van Hoose (loc. cit.) stated that No. 31544 was observed chasing another male, and the pursuer
in turn was followed by a female; he thought that the territorial behavior of this bird suggested
breeding.

Although the Varied Bunting has been recorded only from northwestern Coahuila, I suspect that
this bird is locally common throughout most of the State. Miller (1955a:174) stated that the
habitat of this species consisted of catclaw-covered bottom lands at the base of the Sierra
del Carmen at 4700 feet. Miller's records indicate incipient breeding by P. v. versicolor in
the Sierra del Carmen on April 26. The size of the testes (11 mm.) of No. 35415 and the dates
(June 28, 30) on which Nos. 35414-35415 were collected are strong evidence of breeding by the
Varied Bunting 6 mi. N and 2 mi. W Castillón and 5 mi. S Castillón.

The Painted Bunting is a common summer resident in Coahuila. Marsh and Stevenson (1938:287)
wrote that Painted Buntings were common in summer in the foothills of the Sierra del Carmen,
and they took a male at Piedra Blanca on July 25 and a female at Jardín del Sur on September
1. Amadon and Phillips (1947:580) remarked that two immature Painted Buntings, "apparently
migrants, were taken at Las Delicias on August 10 and 11." Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and
Moore (1957:339) recorded breeding by P. c. pallidior at Hipólito, 4200 feet, on July 1. Dickerman
saw Painted Buntings 4 mi. N San Isidro on May 10, 1954. Hardy saw Painted Buntings at Parras
on July 4, 1955.

All the University of Kansas specimens are typical of the larger subspecies pallidior. The
dates (May 5, 10; June 15, 16, 22, 29) on which these specimens were collected, the sizes of
the testes (9×6 mm.; 6×5 mm.; 7×3 mm.) of Nos. 32140, 31547, and 31546, respectively, and the
size of the largest ovum (2.5 mm.) of No. 32142 indicate breeding by P. c. pallidior in Coahuila.

Carpodacus cassinii Baird.--Cassin's Finch is an uncommon winter migrant in Coahuila. Miller,
Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:314) listed C. cassinii from Sierra Guadalupe.

The House Finch is common in Coahuila. Miller (1955a:174) reported a sparse population of this
species in the foothills adjoining Boquillas Canyon at 4800 feet of the Sierra del Carmen and
observed young just out of the nest on April 25. He remarked also that specimens of the House
Finch from the Sierra del Carmen seem to show no intergradation toward frontalis. Dickerman
also saw the House Finch at San Marcos on May 4, 1954, and Hardy saw it at Parras on July 4,
1955. No. 32147 had a distinct brood patch; the largest ovum of No. 32146 was 7 mm. in diameter.
No. 32145 was a juvenile male.

The University of Kansas specimens agree well with descriptions of C. m. potosinus as given
by Moore (1939:195). No approach toward C. m. frontalis, centralis, or nigrescens is exhibited
by any of these specimens. No. 31675, from Pico de Jimulco in southwestern Coahuila, is paler
above and below than any other specimens of C. m. potosinus. Also the crown of No. 31675 is
suffused with more red than in typical representatives of C. m. potosinus.

**Spinus pinus pinus (Wilson).--Specimen examined: one, sex ?

Spinus pinus macropterus (Bonaparte).--Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:319) recorded
a vagrant S. p. macropterus from 50 mi. S Monclova, 2850 feet, on November 9.

The American Goldfinch is an uncommon migrant or winter visitant in Coahuila. Hellmayr (1938:296)
recorded S. t. pallidus from Sabinas. Fortín and Sabinas are the only places in Coahuila where
S. t. pallidus has been collected. No. 31101 is a typical representative of S. t. pallidus.

In Coahuila, the Lesser Goldfinch seems to be common. Although Miller (1955a:175) did not find
it in the Sierra del Carmen, he reported that Marsh took a specimen on August 22 in Chuperosa
Canyon that was "presumed to" be S. p. psaltria. Burleigh and Lowery (1942:206) observed the
Lesser Goldfinch "on the outskirts of Saltillo in an orchard on April 20."

Nos. 32148-32151 and 32940 were typical for the subspecies psaltria. A partial albino (32939),
which was obtained from a pine-oak-wheat field edge, has upper parts that lack the black coloring
of typical representatives of S. p. psaltria. Instead the crown and back of No. 32939 is yellow,
resembling the color of its underparts, the wing coverts are white, and its primaries are black
with white edgings.

The Rufous-capped Atlapetes occurs uncommonly in southeastern Coahuila. The male and female
A. p. dilutus from 13 mi. E San Antonio de las Alazanas represent the first records of occurrence
of this subspecies in the State. The smaller size, grayer upper parts, and pale yellow color
of the underparts of Nos. 32942-32943 characterize the subspecies dilutus. The size of the
testes (7×6 mm.) of No. 32942 and the date (July 6) on which both specimens were collected
indicate breeding by this species in Coahuila.

The Olive Sparrow is uncommon in Coahuila. Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:349)
listed A. r. rufivirgata from Sabinas on February 10. Sabinas and southeast of San Juan de
Sabinas seem to be the only localities in Coahuila where the Olive Sparrow has been collected
and also are at the westernmost extremity of range of this species. The size of the testes
(9×7 mm.) of No. 32152 and the dates of collection indicate breeding by the Olive Sparrow in
Coahuila.

The Green-tailed Towhee is a common migrant and winter visitant in Coahuila; the species has
been found at several localities. Miller (1955a:175) noted several migrants "each day in the
last week of April ... at the mouth of Boquillas Canyon" of the Sierra del Carmen. Burleigh
and Lowery (1942:207) noted the species "in an arroyo in the open desert country about twenty
miles west of Saltillo on April 22." Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:351) listed
the Green-tailed Towhee from 12 mi. W Saltillo on September 28 and from Sabinas.

The Rufous-sided Towhee is locally common in Coahuila; P. e. gaigei is present in northern
Coahuila. Miller (1955a:175) remarked that "between 6800 and 7500 feet these towhees were sparsely
distributed in areas of scattered low ceanothus and hawthorne, chiefly in canyon bottoms, but
also on slopes where ceanothus was intermingled with downed timber and young pines." He (loc.
cit.) indicated that the adult obtained by Marsh from Vivoras Canyon on August 25 was P. e.
gaigei rather than P. maculatus montanus (see also Sibley, 1950:127). Dickerman saw Rufous-sided
Towhees in the Sierra de la Madera on December 13, 1953. I have referred Nos. 31102 and 31593
to gaigei although both are close to orientalis. The size of the testes (14×8 mm.) of No. 31593
suggests breeding.

This subspecies of the Rufous-sided Towhee occurs in southeastern Coahuila. Burleigh and Lowery
(1942:207) stated that it "was limited in its distribution to the mountain sides ... [and was]
noted in the arroyos at the base of the mountains and from there up to about 8,000 feet." These
authors identified their specimens from Diamante Pass and from Saltillo as Pipilo maculatus
gaigei. Sibley (1950:129) reidentified them, as well as a series from Sierra de Guadalupe,
as P. e. orientalis. The size of the testes (12×7 mm.) of No. 32154 as well as the date (June
25) on which it was obtained suggests breeding by the Rufous-sided Towhee in southeastern Coahuila.

The subspecies potosinus has been recorded from several localities in Coahuila. Davis (1951:70)
listed the following localities in the State from which P. f. potosinus has been collected:
Muralla, San Lázaro Mountains, 50 mi. S Monclova, 2850 ft., Saltillo; Saltillo (Chorro de Agua);
19 mi. W Saltillo; Cresta Blanca, 12 mi. W Saltillo, 5500 ft.; Diamante Pass, 11 mi. S Saltillo,
6000-8000 ft.; and Carneros. Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:358) recorded a "small
juvenile" from El Diamante on July 5. Sutton and Burleigh (1939a:45) recorded P. f. texanus
from Diamante Pass on March 6. I suspect that Davis (op. cit.) reidentified the specimen concerned
from Diamante Pass as P. f. potosinus. Burleigh and Lowery (1942:207) indicated that P. f.
potosinus "was fairly common and of general distribution in the area, occurring both on the
arid plateau about Saltillo and on the mountain sides up to an elevation of about 8,000 feet."
Nos. 32155, 31676, and 29560 are typical for P. f. potosinus. The size of the testes (14×7
mm.) of No. 32155 suggests breeding by the Brown Towhee in southeastern Coahuila.

This subspecies of the Brown Towhee occurs in northwestern Coahuila south through the Sierra
del Carmen. Miller (1955a:176) reported that his series of Brown Towhees from the Sierra del
Carmen agreed satisfactorily with texanus although revealing some sign of intergradation with
potosinus. Davis (1951:70) thought that P. f. potosinus is present in northern as well as southern
Coahuila. Miller (1955a:176), however, remarked that P. f. texanus is more characteristic of
the population of Brown Towhees of northwestern Coahuila. He indicated that a single juvenile
taken by Marsh on August 28 from Jardín del Sur and allocated to P. f. potosinus by Davis probably
is P. f. texanus.

Calamospiza melanocorys Stejneger.--Specimen examined: one, [Male] 30239, from 10 mi. E Torreón,
3700 ft., January 9, 1951.

The Lark Bunting is an uncommon winter visitant in Coahuila. Other than the present specimen,
the only record of the Lark Bunting in Coahuila is that of Burleigh and Lowery (1942:207),
who reported a small flock of this species from which several specimens were collected "on
April 20 in a field on the edge of Saltillo."

Passerculus sandwichensis oblitus Peters and Griscom.--Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore
(1957:364) recorded P. s. oblitus from Sabinas on February 25 and March 18 and 24. These records
represent sparse winter visitants to Coahuila.

Passerculus sandwichensis brooksi Bishop.--Burleigh and Lowery (1942:208) recorded P. s. brooksi
from Diamante Pass in April; Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:363) remarked that
this specimen is perhaps best regarded as a variant of one of the races normally wintering
in this area.

Burleigh and Lowery (1942:208) recorded P. s. anthinus from Diamante Pass. This subspecies
is not uncommon in Coahuila. The University of Kansas specimens showed no indication of breeding.

Passerculus sandwichensis nevadensis Grinnell.--This subspecies of the Savannah Sparrow is
uncommon in Coahuila; Hellmayr (1938:490) listed one specimen from Sabinas.

Passerculus sandwichensis brunnescens (Butler).--Burleigh and Lowery (1942:208) recorded this
subspecies of the Savannah Sparrow from Diamante Pass in April. No. 31562, which was obtained
in a yucca and acacia association, had little fat.

Ammodramus bairdii (Audubon).--Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:368) remarked that
Baird's Sparrow is a rare winter visitant to the northern states of México and recorded A.
bairdii from Saltillo on May 8.

Pooecetes gramineus confinis Baird.--The Vesper Sparrow seems to be an uncommon winter visitant
in Coahuila. Miller (1955a:176) found P. g. confinis "on two occasions in the grass of the
dry ciénega at the head of Corte Madera Canyon at 7500 feet" on April 9 and 14 in the Sierra
del Carmen. In April, Burleigh and Lowery (1942:208) found P. g. confinis only in Diamante
Valley where this sparrow "appeared to be quite uncommon." Sutton and Burleigh (1939a:45) took
a male P. g. confinis at San Pedro on January 29.

The Lark Sparrow is not uncommon in Coahuila. Miller (1955a:176) saw one male, "apparently
on a breeding territory, on April 27 in an open, rather barren desert flat adjoining the lower
part of Boquillas wash at 4600 feet." He reported that Marsh took a young of the year, still
largely in juvenile plumage, on September 6 in the Sierra del Carmen. Amadon and Phillips (1947:580)
remarked that Lark Sparrows were common "about Las Delicias" after August 18. The pale and
narrowly streaked upperparts of No. 32156 are typical for C. g. strigatus. The size of the
testes (9×4 mm.) of No. 32156 and the date (June 18) on which it was obtained suggest breeding
by the Lark Sparrow in northeastern Coahuila.

*Aimophila ruficeps tenuirostris Burleigh and Lowery.--This subspecies of the Rufous-crowned
Sparrow is resident in the northern part of Coahuila. Miller (1955a:176) remarked that the
species "ranged up to 7000 feet on open south-facing slopes within the oak belt" of the Sierra
del Carmen. Specimens collected by him showed no approach to boucardi of southern México and
seem to be closest to tenuirostris. Miller referred the specimen that Marsh and Stevenson (1938:287)
took on August 22 in Chuperosa Canyon to tenuirostris rather than boucardi. Miller, Friedmann,
Griscom, and Moore (1957:376) listed A. r. tenuirostris from 50 mi. S Monclova on November
8 and 10.

*Aimophila ruficeps boucardi (Sclater).--This subspecies of the Rufous-crowned Sparrow is common
in southern Coahuila. Burleigh and Lowery (1942:208) indicated that A. r. boucardi was common
throughout the mountainous areas and to some extent in the arroyos of the open desert country
of southeastern Coahuila. Sutton and Burleigh (1939a:46) took a female A. r. boucardi "near
Diamante Pass." Ridgway (1901:252) listed A. r. boucardi from Carneros. A. r. tenuirostris
and boucardi seem to intergrade in central and even southern Coahuila. Miller, Friedmann, Griscom,
and Moore (1957:376) recorded intermediate populations of the Rufous-crowned Sparrow from 12
mi. W Saltillo.

Cassin's Sparrow seems to be common in Coahuila. The AOU Check-list Committee (1957:603) listed
A. cassinii from 10 mi. E Saltillo. Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:378-379) recorded
Cassin's Sparrow from Sabinas, on April 25; from 25 mi. SW Monclova, on November 20; from 12
mi. W Saltillo, on September 28; and from 10 mi. NE Saltillo, on July 3. These authors stated
that Cassin's Sparrow was breeding 10 mi. NE Saltillo. The sizes of the testes (5×3 mm.; 7×5
mm.) of Nos. 32157-32158, respectively, and the dates (June 14, July 6) on which they were
obtained are additional evidence of breeding by Cassin's Sparrow in Coahuila.

The Black-throated Sparrow is common in Coahuila. Typical representatives of A. b. bilineata
occur in eastern Coahuila. The center of the State is occupied by intergrades between A. b.
bilineata, opuntia, and grisea. Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:381) reported A.
b. bilineata from the "Saltillo area." Hellmayr (1938:539) recorded A. b. bilineata from Sabinas.
The sizes (13, 14 mm.) of the white spot on the lateral tail feathers of Nos. 32163 and 32160,
respectively, suggest A. b. bilineata. The short wing (61-64.5 mm.) and the lighter and browner
color of the backs of Nos. 32163, 32160, and 32161 are suggestive of A. b. bilineata. Nevertheless,
the size (8 mm.) of the white spot on the lateral tail feather of No. 32161 indicates intergradation
with A. b. opuntia.

The sizes of the testes (6×4 mm.; 8 mm.) of Nos.

This subspecies of the Black-throated Sparrow occurs in northwestern Coahuila. Miller (1955a:176)
stated that the Black-throated Sparrow was moderately common in the open desert scrub at the
base of the Sierra del Carmen below 4800 feet. He said that the series of Black-throated Sparrows
from the Sierra del Carmen "resembles most the race opuntia of western Texas ... but shows
some intergradation toward grisea of southern Coahuila and toward A. b. bilineata of eastern
Coahuila." He remarked also that the specimen from Jardín del Sur, which Marsh and Stevenson
(1938:287) reported as A. b. grisea, was in extremely worn, dirty summer plumage and contributed
nothing reliable to racial determination.

A. b. grisea is the subspecies of Black-throated Sparrow in southern Coahuila. Burleigh and
Lowery (1942:208) saw this sparrow "frequently on the arid plateau around Saltillo" and obtained
specimens there that were identified as A. b. grisea. Amadon and Phillips (1947:581) saw individuals
on August 8 and 28 that were feeding "fledged young near Saltillo." The size of the testes
(4.5×3 mm.) of No. 31665 indicates that A. b. grisea may breed in southern Coahuila.

In Coahuila the Mexican Junco seems to be common. Miller (1955a:177) found it in the conifers
of the upper Corte Madera drainage at 7500 feet and up to 8800 feet on Loomis Peak in the Sierra
del Carmen. Marsh and Stevenson (1938:287) took an adult in Vivoras Canyon on August 14 in
the Sierra del Carmen. Sutton and Burleigh (1939a:46) found small flocks at Diamante Pass in
March. Burleigh and Lowery (1942:208-209) noted J. p. palliatus as a common bird of the mountain
slopes above an elevation of about 7000 feet in southeastern Coahuila, and obtained specimens
at Diamante Pass. Ridgway (1901:300) recorded J. p. phaeonotus from Sierra Encarnación. His
record should be of J. p. palliatus as indicated by Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:386).
Dickerman saw Mexican Juncos in the Sierra de la Madera on December 13, 1953.

No. 31633 shows no sign of intergrading with J. p. phaeonotus to the south. The outermost rectrix
of No. 31633 is wholly white; the second rectrix is nearly as white. No. 31633 is paler than
representatives of J. p. phaeonotus from the southern part of the Central Plateau of México.

The Chipping Sparrow is a common spring and possibly fall migrant in Coahuila. Miller (1955a:177)
noted small flocks from April 21 to 27 in the Sierra del Carmen where specimens were taken.
Burleigh and Lowery (1942:209) indicated that S. p. arizonae was "quite common and of general
distribution" at Saltillo and Diamante Pass and remarked that specimens were taken at these
localities in April. Amadon and Phillips (1947:581) took two Chipping Sparrows "near Las Delicias
on August 17." Dickerman saw individuals in the Sierra del Pino on May 12, 1954, and at San
Marcos on May 4, 1954. Our specimens, which are typical representatives of S. p. arizonae,
are pale; the ground color of their backs is grayish buff.

Spizella pallida (Swainson).--The Clay-colored Sparrow is a migrant or winter visitant in Coahuila.
Burleigh and Lowery (1942:209) saw "large flocks of sparrows, mostly of this species, ... on
frequent occasions in the cultivated fields and orchards on the outskirts of Saltillo." Four
specimens were taken by Burleigh and Lowery (loc. cit.) on April 19 and 20 at Saltillo.

Brewer's Sparrow is probably a winter resident in much of Coahuila. Miller, Friedmann, Griscom,
and Moore (1957:389) recorded S. b. breweri from 25 mi. NW Monclova on November 20 and from
8 mi. S Cuatro Ciénegas on November 15. The only definite records obtained by Burleigh and
Lowery (1942:209) of S. b. breweri are those of a female and a male taken "near Saltillo" on
April 16 and 18. The size of the dorsal area of sandy buff with narrow streakings of Nos. 31114-31115
suggests S. b. breweri.

The Field Sparrow is an uncommon spring and probably fall migrant in Coahuila. Other than No.
31116, S. p. arenacea has only been recorded from Sabinas in March, when three specimens were
obtained (Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore, 1957:390). The coloration of No. 31116 is
much grayer and the black streaks on its back are much narrower than on typical representatives
of S. p. pusilla.

**Spizella wortheni wortheni Ridgway.--The single specimen of Worthen's Sparrow obtained by
Burleigh and Lowery (1942:209) "just outside the limits of Saltillo on April 16" represents
the only record of occurrence of this species in Coahuila.

**Spizella atrogularis atrogularis (Cabanis).--Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:391)
remarked that the Black-chinned Sparrow is a common resident of the Central Plateau from Durango
and southern Coahuila southward. Burleigh and Lowery (1942:212) noted the species only at the
foot of the mountains of southeastern Coahuila where, at 6000 feet, scattered pairs were found.
Miller (1955a:177) observed a male on April 23 on a slope at the mouth of Boquillas Canyon
of the Sierra del Carmen; he presumed it to be a transient.

The White-crowned Sparrow is a fairly common migrant or winter visitant in Coahuila. Miller,
Friedman, Griscom, and Moore (1957:393) recorded Z. l. leucophrys from Sabinas on March 16
and February 23. Burleigh and Lowery (1942:212) remarked that "small flocks of White-crowned
Sparrows were seen at infrequent intervals in thickets and stretches of underbrush on the outskirts
of Saltillo on April 18 and again on April 24 ... [and] near a small town some twenty miles
west of Saltillo on April 22." Specimens that Burleigh and Lowery (loc. cit.) collected "near
Saltillo" were identified as Z. l. leucophrys.

Miller (1955a:177) noted Z. l. gambelii on April 27 at 4600 feet in Boquillas wash in the Sierra
del Carmen. Hellmayr (1938:568) listed Z. l. gambelii from Sabinas.

Zontrichia leucophrys oriantha Oberholser.--This subspecies has been recorded from Sabinas
on April 25 and Hipólito on November 5 (Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore, 1957:393).

Lincoln's Sparrow seems to be a fairly common migrant or winter visitant in Coahuila; M. l.
lincolnii is the common subspecies. Burleigh and Lowery (1942:212) found this sparrow only
in a grain field situated between a small pond and a narrow stream on the outskirts of Saltillo;
the four specimens collected were identified as M. l. lincolnii. No. 31595 was obtained in
a pine-oak association.

Melospiza lincolnii alticola (Miller and McCabe).--Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:398)
listed M. l. alticola, which seems to be uncommon in Coahuila, from Sabinas on March 14.

Melospiza lincolnii gracilis (Kittlitz).--Miller (1955a:177) took an unsexed representative
of M. l. gracilis on April 7 in Carboneras Canyon of the Sierra del Carmen at 6700 feet. This
occurrence is at the extreme eastern range of this subspecies.

Melospiza georgiana ericrypta Oberholser.--In Coahuila this subspecies of the Swamp Sparrow
has been recorded as a migrant or winter visitant. Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:399)
recorded it from Sabinas on February 22 to March 8 and from 8 mi. S Cuatro Ciénegas on November 4.
