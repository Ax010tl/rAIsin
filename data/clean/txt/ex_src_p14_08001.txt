This sum covered the cost of forms for one side of the building 85 ft. long and containing
150 cu. yds. of concrete, hence the cost of forms was in round figures $1.10 per cu. yd. of
concrete. Each cubic yard of concrete required 1,997 ÷ 150 = 13-1/3 ft. B. M. of form lumber.

The concrete was a 1-2½-4½ mixture. A careful record for 15 days, showed an average of 2.8
cu. yds. of concrete placed in 6 hours by a gang of 6.3 men. From this we can figure the cost
of concrete in place to be about as follows:

2.8 cu. yds. concrete at $3 for materials     $ 8.40
6.3 men 6 hours at 15 cts.                      5.67
1 foreman 6 hours at $4 per day                 2.00
                                              ------
  Total per cu. yd.                           $16.07

Thus the cost of concrete in place was $16.07 ÷ 2.8 = $5.73 per cu. yd. Adding the cost of
forms we get $5.73 + $1.10 = $6.83 per cu. yd. as the cost for labor and materials in constructing
forms and mixing and placing concrete.

Offsets and molding decorations were easily made, although they were quite numerous on the
building in question, at least more so than would ordinarily be the case in mill building construction.
The offset of 1 ft. at every column was made very readily by sliding wooden shoulder pieces
into place on the inner face of the form, which pieces in turn received 2-in. faced planking,
the latter being slid into place from above. Thus the entire system was collapsible and small
alterations were easily made whenever the form was shifted. Flat surfaces or offsets could
be obtained at will by either removing or setting in the shoulder pieces. Molding effects were
made on the front face of the wall by tacking molding strips to the form wherever necessary.
The entire work was done with common labor and the finished building presented a smooth, homogeneous
surface which required very little dressing.

~FLOOR AND ROOF CONSTRUCTION FOR FOUR-STORY GARAGE.~--The building was 53×200 ft., and 4 stories
high, with provision for 2 additional stories in the design of footings and columns. Two rows
of wall columns connected by transverse girders carrying the floor and roof slabs made a comparatively
simple construction, except for a mezzanine floor carried on cantilever beams and except for
the use of cantilever footings; these two special details are shown by Figs. 236 and 237. The
amount of concrete in the building was 1,910 cu. yds., distributed as follows:

                                 Cu. yds.

Footings, reinforced                  190
Columns, reinforced                   450
Floors and roof, reinforced         1,100
Floor on ground, not reinforced       170
                                    -----
  Total                             1,910

The amount of reinforcing metal used was 237 tons, distributed as follows:

Item.                  Tons.    Lbs. per cu. yd.
Footings                42           442
Columns                 20            90
Floors and roof        175           318
                       ---           ---
  Total and average    237           272

This is equivalent to 2 per cent. of steel in 1,910 - 170 = 1,740 cu. yds.

Forms.--The total area of concrete covered by forms (1,740 cu. yds.) was 94,000 sq. ft., distributed
as follows:

Footings, sq. ft.                4,000
Columns, sq. ft.                20,000
Floors and girders, sq. ft.     70,000
                                ------
Total, sq. ft.                  94,000

For the work 50,000 ft. B. M. of old lumber was used and 170,000 ft. B. M. of new lumber was
bought, the cost being as follows:

50 M. ft. B. M. at $13 per M.    $  650
170 M. ft. B. M. at $26 per M.    4,420
                                 ------
220 M. ft. B. M. at $23          $5,070

This is equivalent to 126 ft. B. M. per cu. yd. of concrete. New forms were made for each floor
except the sides of the girder molds which were re-used so far as they would fit, but the roof
forms were made from lumber used for the floors. In all no more than 20 per cent of the form
lumber was used a second time. In round figures new lumber was required for 80,000 sq. ft.
of concrete; this gives a cost for lumber of 6.4 cts. per sq. ft. The construction of the column
and floor forms is shown by Fig. 238. A force of 15 carpenters at $4.40 per day under a foreman
at $35 per week erected and tore down forms; the carrying was done by laborers at $1.70 per
day working under a foreman at $35 per week; carpenters worked an 8-hour and laborers a 10-hour
day. Forms for one floor were framed and erected in 8 to 10 days. The cost of forms for 1,740
cu. yds. and 80,000 sq. ft. of concrete and per M. ft. B. M. was as follows:

  Item.                        Per cu. yd. Per sq. ft. Per M. ft.
Lumber                            $2.90       $0.064       $23.00

Handling lumber                    1.10 }                    8.70
                                   -----      ------       ------
  Totals                           $6.00      $0.121       $47.37

The lumber had a considerable salvage value which is not allowed for in the above figures.

Concrete.--The concrete was a Portland cement, ¾-in. trap rock mixture, mixed wet in two Chicago
Improved Cube Mixers equipped with charging buckets. The mixers were located on the ground
floor, one at the rear and one at the front of the building, both discharging directly to a
hoist. With a gang of 30 men at $1.70 per 10-hour day under a foreman at $35 per week a floor
was concreted in 2 days, the columns being concreted the first day and the floor being concreted
the second day. The labor cost for mixing and placing concrete and for fabricating and setting
reinforcement was as follows:

  Item.                         Per cu. yd.
Mixing and placing concrete       $1.95
Erecting and setting steel         2.05
                                  -----
  Total                           $4.00

The cost of concreting includes the cost of granolithic surface for the floor slabs. The girder
reinforcement was made up into unit frames and the frames were set as a unit, horses set over
the molds being used to suspend and lower them into place. The cost of $2.05 per cu. yd. is
equivalent to ¾ ct. per lb. Summarizing, we have the following cost for materials and labor
on forms and for labor mixing and placing concrete and reinforcement:

                                Per cu. yd.
Lumber for forms                 $ 2.90
Labor on forms                     3.10
Labor on concrete                  1.95
Labor on steel                     2.05
                                  -----
  Total                          $10.00

This $10 total does not include the cost of the concrete nor of the steel.

This chapter deals exclusively with the methods and cost of molding and erecting separately
molded wall blocks, girders, columns and slabs. The structural advantages and disadvantages
of this type of construction as compared with monolithic construction will not be considered.
The data given in succeeding paragraphs show how separate piece work has been done and what
it has actually cost to do it in a number of instances.

~COLUMN, GIRDER AND SLAB CONSTRUCTION.~--European engineers have developed several styles of
open web or hollow girder and column shapes, but in America solid columns and girders have
been used except in the comparatively few cases where one of the European constructions has
been introduced by its American agents.

~Warehouses, Brooklyn, N. Y.~--In constructing a series of warehouses in Brooklyn, N. Y., the
columns and girders were molded in forms on the ground. For molding the columns, forms consisting
of two side pieces and one bottom piece, were used, saving 25 per cent. in the amount of lumber
required for a column form, and doing away with yokes and bolts, since only simple braces were
required to hold the side forms in place. It was found that the side forms could readily be
removed in 24 to 48 hours, thus considerably reducing the time that a considerable portion
of the form lumber was tied up. It was figured by Mr. E. P. Goodrich, the engineer in charge
of this work, that this possible re-use of form lumber reduced the amount required another
50 per cent. as compared with molding in place. Girders were molded like columns in three-sided
forms; the saving in form work was somewhat less than in the case of columns, but it was material.
In general, Mr. Goodrich states, the cost of hoisting and placing molded concrete members is
higher per yard than when the concrete is placed wet. That is in mass before it is hardened.

~Factory, Reading, Pa.~--In constructing a factory at Reading, Pa., an open or lattice web
type of girder invented by Mr. Franz Visintini and extensively used in Austria was adopted;
columns were molded in place in the usual manner with bracket tops to form girder seats. The
girders were reinforced with three trusses made up of top and bottom chord rods connected by
diagonal web rods; one truss was located at the center of the beam and one at each side. The
method of molding was as follows: The trusses were made by cutting the chord rods to length
and threading the web diagonals and verticals onto them. To permit threading the web pieces
were bent, when rods were used, with an eye at each end; when straps were used the ends were
punched with holes. The work was very simple and was done mostly by boys in the machine shop
of the company for which the building was being erected. The girders were molded two at a time
in forms constructed as shown by the sketch. Fig. 239. A form consisted of a center board,
two side boards, two end pieces and the proper number of cast iron cores, all clamped together
by three yokes. Triangular cast iron plates, A, were screwed to the bottom boards for spacers.
The side, center and end boards were then set up and the end clamps were placed. The cast iron
hollow cores, B, were then set over the spacers, and the form was ready for pouring. A layer
of concrete was placed in the bottom of the mold and the first side truss was placed; the concrete
was then brought half way up and the middle truss was placed; concreting was then continued
up to the plane of the second side truss which was placed and covered. Cores and forms were
all cleaned and greased each time they were used. The cores were removed first by means of
a lever device and generally within three or four hours after the concrete was placed. The
remainder of the form was taken down in two to four days and the beam removed.

~Kilnhouse, New Village, N. J.~--In constructing a kiln house for a cement works one story
columns with bracket tops and 50-ft. span roof girders were molded on the ground and erected
as single pieces. The columns by rough calculation averaged about 2 cu. yds. of concrete and
675 lbs. of reinforcement each or about 337 lbs. of steel per cubic yard. The girders averaged
by similar calculation 5 cu. yds. of concrete and 2,260 lbs. of steel, or 452 lbs. per cubic
yard of concrete. The average weight of columns was thus not far from 41.3 tons and of girders
fully 11 tons.

Several combinations of arrangements were used for molding the columns and girders. For wall
columns having one bracket the arrangement shown by Fig. 240 was adopted. The concrete slab
molding platform was covered with paper, and on this the two outside and the middle columns
were cast in forms. When those columns had set the forms were removed, the intervening spaces
were papered and the two remaining columns were cast. Ten columns, five sets of two columns
in line, were cast on each base. The remaining columns were cast in combination with girders
as shown by Fig. 241. The two outside lines of columns (1) were molded in forms, allowed to
stand until set and then stripped. Using a column surmounted by a shallow side form for one
side and a full depth side form for the other side molds were fashioned for the two outside
girders, Nos. 2 and 3. One full depth side form and the side of girder No. 2 formed the mold
for girder No. 4. Girder No. 5 was then molded between girders No. 3 and No. 4.

The construction of the girder forms is shown by Fig. 242. This drawing shows one of the four
main sections making up a complete form. A full size form of this construction contained about
1,100 ft. B. M. of lumber, and three were built, so that 3,300 ft. B. M. of form lumber were
used for molding 20 girders, or 33 ft. B. M. per cubic yard of concrete. A full size column
form contained about 225 ft. B. M. of lumber, and eight were constructed, so that 1,800 ft.
B. M. of form lumber were used for molding 56 columns, or about 16 ft. B. M. per cubic yard
of concrete.

The following was the cost of erecting a full column form including lining, plumbing, bracing
and yoking, but excluding lumber and original construction:

1 carpenter, 3 hrs., at $0.25           $0.750
1 helper, 3 hrs., at $0.175              0.525
1 helper, 1 hr., at $0.175               0.175
1-5 boss carpenter, 3 hrs., at $0.30     0.180
                                        ------
  Total                                 $1.630

This gives a cost of $7.25 per M. ft. B. M. for erecting column forms.

The cost of erecting a full size girder form including lining, plumbing, bracing and setting
six bolts was as follows:

2 carpenters, 5 hrs., at $0.25        $2.50
2 helpers, 5 hrs., at $0.175           1.75
2 laborers, ½ hr., at $0.15            0.15
¼ boss carpenter, at $0.30             0.375
                                      ------
  Total                               $4.775

This gives a cost of $4.35 per M. ft. B. M. for erecting girder forms.

The reinforcement was erected inside the forms for both columns and girders. The cost of erection
for one column was:

2 laborers, 4 hrs., at $0.15       $1.20
1/3 foreman, 4 hrs., at $0.225      0.30
                                   -----
Total                              $1.50

This gives a cost of about 0.22 cts. per pound for erecting column reinforcement, including
the bending of the horizontal ties or hoops. The girder reinforcement was erected by piece
work at a cost of $1.80 per girder--or about 0.08 ct. per pound.

The concrete used was a 1-6 mixture of Portland cement and crusher run stone all passing a
½-in. sieve and 10 per cent. passing a 200 mesh sieve. No trouble was had in handling this
fine aggregate. It was mixed in a Ransome mixer, elevated so as to deliver the batches into
cars on a standard gage track. This track ran between the base slabs on which the molding was
done. Each car held about 3 cu. yds. and discharged through a side gate and spout directly
into the forms, the mixture being made so wet that it would flow readily. The company used
its own cement and stone for concrete and charged up the cement at $1 per barrel and the stone
at 60 cts. per cubic yard. At these prices, and assuming that a cubic yard of concrete of the
mixture above described would contain about 1.25 bbl. of cement and 1.5 cu. yd. of stone, we
have the following cost of materials per cubic yard of concrete:

1.25 bbls. of cement, at $1      $1.25
1.5 cu. yds. stone, at $0.60      0.90
                                 -----
Total                            $2.15

The actual cost of mixing the concrete and delivering it to the cars was as follows:

  Item.                 Per cu. yd.
1 foreman, at 20 cts per hour                 $0.0300
3 men shoveling stone, at 15 cts. per hour     0.0675
3 men filling hopper, at 15 cts. per hour      0.0675
1 man bringing cement, at 18 cts. per hour     0.0225
1 man dumping cement, at 15 cts. per hour      0.0225
9 h.p., at ½ ct. per h.p. hour                 0.0450
Superintendence, repairs, etc.                 0.0270
                                              -------
Total                                         $0.2820

The cost of hauling the concrete from mixer to forms ran about 2.7 cts. per cubic yard, so
that we have a cost for concrete in place of:

Concrete materials, per cu. yd.            $2.150
Mixing concrete, per cu. yd.                0.281
Hauling concrete, per cu. yd.               0.027
                                           ------
Total cost, per cu. yd.                    $2.458

The cost, then, per column or girder molded, assuming that it was necessary to erect a full
form, was about as follows:

  Columns:
2 cu. yds. concrete, at $2.46          $ 4.92
675 lbs. steel, at 2½ cts.              16.77
Erecting steel, at 0.22 ct. per lb.      1.50
Erecting forms                           1.63
                                       ------
  Total                                $24.82

  Girders:
5 cu. yds. concrete, at $2.46          $12.30
2,260 lbs. steel, at 2½ cts.         56.50
Erecting steel, at 0.08 ct. per lb.      1.80
Erecting forms                           4.77
                                        -----
Total                                  $75.37

These figures give a unit cost of $12.41 per cu. yd. for molded columns, and of $15.07 per
cu. yd. for molded girders, The columns were erected by a Browning locomotive crane, which
lifted and carried them to the work and up-ended them into place. To facilitate lifting the
columns from the molding bed a 1½-in. pipe 8 ins. long was cast into both ends; pins inserted
into these sockets provided hitches for the tackle. The column was lifted off the molding bed
and blocked up, then iron clamps were attached, one at each end, as shown by Fig. 243. A gang
of 1 foreman and 14 men erected from 5 to 7, or an average of 6 columns per 10-hour day. The
average wages of the erecting gang were 21 cts. per hour. The cost then of column erection
was (14 × $2.10) ÷ 6 = $5.25 per column, or $2.63 per cu. yd. of concrete.

The roof girders had 1-in. eye-bolts 24 ins. long cast into them vertically about 4 ft. from
the ends. They were lifted off the molding bed by tackle by the locomotive crane to these eye-bolts
and blocked up to permit the adjustment of the sling. This sling is shown by the sketch, Fig.
244, and as will be observed acts as a truss. At first it was used without the vertical, but
the cantilever action of the unsupported ends caused cracks. The girders were loaded onto cars
by the locomotive crane and taken to the work, where they were hoisted and placed by a gin
pole. The girder erecting gang consisted of 1 foreman and 14 men, working a 10-hour day at
21 cts. per hour. This gang erected four girders per day, at a cost of (15 × $2.10) ÷ 4 = $7.87
per girder, or $1.57 per cu. yd. of concrete.

The cost of girders and columns in place was thus about as follows:

  Columns:     Per unit.     Per cu. yd.
Molding          $25.00       $12.50
Erecting           5.25         2.63
