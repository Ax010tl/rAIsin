Such is the internal composition of the instinct of' equality, and such is the natural instinct
of Frenchmen. It is beneficial or mischievous according as one or the other of its ingredients
predominates, at one time the noble sentiment of equity and at another time the low envy of
foolish vanity;[3304] healthy or unhealthy, however, its power in France is enormous, and the
new Régime gratifies it in every possible way, good or bad. No more legal disqualifications!
On the one hand, the republican laws of proscription or of exception were all repealed: we
have seen an amnesty and the return of the émigrés, the Concordat, the restoration of Catholic
worship, the compulsory reconciliation of the constitutionalists with the orthodox; the First
Consul admits no difference between them; his new clergy are recruited from both groups and,
in this respect, he forces the Pope to yield.[3305] He gives twelve of the sixty episcopal
thrones to former schismatics; he wants them to take their places boldly; he relieves them
from ecclesiastical penitence and from any humiliating recantation; he takes care that, in
the other forty-eight dioceses, the priests who formerly took the civic oath shall be employed
and well treated by their superiors who, at the same epoch, refused to take the civic oath.
On the other hand, all the exclusions, inequalities and distinctions of the monarchy remain
abolished. Not only are the Calvinist and even Israelite cults legally authorized, the same
as the Catholic cult, but, again, the Protestant consistories and Jewish synagogues[3306] are
constituted and organized on the same footing as the Catholic churches. Pastors and rabbis
likewise become functionaries under the same title as bishops and cure's; all are recognized
or sanctioned by the government and all equally benefit by its patronage: it is an unique thing
in Europe to find the small churches of the minority obtaining the same measure of indifference
and good will from the State as the great church of the majority, and, henceforth, in fact
as in law, the ministers of the three cults, formerly ignored, tolerated or proscribed, enjoy
their rank, titles and honors in the social as well as in the legal hierarchy, equally with
the ministers of that cult which was once the only one dominant or allowed

Similarly, in the civilian status, no inferiority or discredit must legally attach to any condition
whatever, either to plebeian, villager, peasant or poor man as such, as formerly under the
monarchy; nor to noble, bourgeois, citizen, notable or rich man, as recently under the Republic.
Each of these two classes is relieved of its degradation; no class is burdened by taxation
or by the conscription beyond its due; all persons and all property find in the government,
in the administration, in the tribunals, in the gendarme, the same reliable protection.--So
much for equity and the true spirit of equality.--Let us now turn around and consider envy
and the bad spirit of equality. The plebiscite, undoubtedly, as well as the election of deputies
to the Corps Legislatif are simply comedies; but, in these comedies, one rôle is as good as
another and the duke of the old or new pattern, a mere figurant among hundreds and thousands
of others, votes only once like the corner-grocer. Undoubtedly, the private individual of the
commune or department, in institutions of charity, worship or education, is deprived of any
independence, of any initiation, of any control, as the State has confiscated for itself all
collective action; but the classes deprived of this are especially the upper classes, alone
sufficiently enlightened and wealthy to take the lead, form projects and provide for expenditure:
in this usurpation, the State has encroached upon and eaten deeper into the large body of superior
existences scattered about than into the limited circle where humbler lives clamber and crawl
along; nearly the entire loss, all perceptible privation, is for the large landed proprietor
and not for his hired hands, for the large manufacturer or city merchant and not for their
workmen or clerks,[3307] while the clerk, the workman, the journeyman, the handicraftsman,
who grumble at being the groundlings, find themselves less badly off since their masters or
patrons, fallen from a higher point, are where they are and they can elbow them.

Now that men are born on the ground, all on the same level, and are confined within universal
and uniform limits, social life no longer appears to them other than a competition, a rivalry
instituted and proclaimed by the State, and of which it is the umpire; for, through its interference,
all are comprised within its enclosure and shut up and kept there; no other field is open to
run on; on the contrary, every career within these bounds, indicated and staked out beforehand,
offers an opportunity for all runners: the government has laid out and leveled the ground,
established compartments, divided off and prepared rectilinear lists which converge to the
goal; there, it presides, the unique arbiter of the race, exposing to all competitors the innumerable
prizes which it proposes for them.--These prizes consist of offices, the various employments
of the State, political, military, ecclesiastical, judiciary, administrative and university,
all the honors and dignities which it dispenses, all the grades of its hierarchy from the lowest
to the highest, from that of corporal, college-regent, alderman, office--supernumerary, assistant
priest up to that of senator, marshal of France, grand master of the university, cardinal,
and minister of State. It confers on its possessor, according to the greater or lesser importance
of the place, a greater or lesser portion of the advantages which all men crave and seek for
money, power, patronage, influence, consideration, importance and social pre-eminence; thus,
according to the rank one attains in the hierarchy, one is something, or of some account; outside
of the hierarchy, one is nothing.

Consequently, the faculty for getting in and advancing one's self in these lists is the most
precious of all: in the new Régime it is guaranteed by the law as a common right and is open
to all Frenchmen. As no other outlet for them is allowed by the State it owes them this one;
since it invites them and reduces everybody to competing under its direction it is bound to
be an impartial arbiter; since the quality of citizen, in itself and through it alone, confers
the right to make one's way, all citizens indifferently must enjoy the right of succeeding
in any employment, the very highest, and without any distinction as to birth, fortune, cult
or party. There must be no more preliminary exclusions; no more gratuitous preferences, undeserved
favors, anticipated promotions; no more special favors.--Such is the rule of the modern State:
constituted as it is, that is to say, monopolizer and omnipresent, it cannot violate this rule
for any length of time with impunity. In France, at least, the good and bad spirits of equality
agree in exacting adherence to it: on this point, the French are unanimous; no article of their
social code is more cherished by them; this one flatters their amour-propre and tickles their
imagination; it exalts hope, nourishes illusion, intensifies the energy and enjoyment of life.--Thus
far, the principle has remained inert, powerless, held in suspension in the air, in the great
void of speculative declarations and of constitutional promises. Napoleon brings it down to
the ground and renders it practical; that which the assemblies had decreed in vain for ten
years he brings about for the first time and in his own interest. To exclude a class or category
of men from offices and promotion would be equivalent to depriving one's self gratuitously
of all the talents it contains, and, moreover, to incurring, besides the inevitable rancor
of these frustrated talents, the sullen and lasting discontent of the entire class or category.
The First Consul would do himself a wrong were he to curb his right to choose: he needs every
available capacity, and he takes them where he finds them, to the right, to the left, above
or below, in order to keep his regiments full and enroll in his service every legitimate ambition
and every justifiable pretension.

Under the monarchy, an obscure birth debarred even the best endowed men from the principal
offices. Under the Consulate and the Empire the two leading personages of the State are Lebrun,
Maupeou's old secretary, a productive translator,[3308] a lawyer, formerly councilor in a provincial
court of justice, then third-consul, then Duc de Plaisance and arch-chancellor of the Empire
and Cambacérès, second-consul, then Duc de Parme and arch-chancellor of the Empire, both of
them being princes. Similarly, the marshals are new men and soldiers of fortune, a few of them
born in the class of inferior nobles or in the ordinary bourgeois class, mostly among the people
or even amongst the populace, and, in its lowest ranks, Masséna, the son of a wine-dealer,
once a cabin-boy and then common soldier and non-commissioned officer for fourteen years; Ney,
son of a cooper, Lefebvre, son of a miller, Murat, son of a tavern-keeper, Lannes, son of an
hostler, and Augereau, son of a mason and a female dealer in fruit and vegetables.--Under the
Republic, noble birth consigned, or confined, the ablest and best qualified men for their posts
to a voluntary obscurity, only too glad when their names did not condemn them to exile, imprisonment
or to the guillotine. Under the Empire, M. de Talleyrand is prince of Benevento, minister of
foreign affairs and vice-grand-elector with a salary of five hundred thousand francs. We see
personages of old nobility figuring in the first ranks: among the clergy M. de Roquelaure,
M. de Boisgelin, M. de Broglie, M. Ferdinand de Rohan; in the magistracy, M. Séguier, M. Pasquier,
M. Molé; on the domestic and decorative staff of the palace, Comte de Ségur, grand-master of
ceremonies, Comte de Montesquiou-Fézensac, grand-chamberlain, also as chamberlains, Comtes
d'Aubusson de la Feuillade, de Brigode, de Croy, de Coutades, de Louvois, de Brancas, de Gontaut,
de Grammont, de Beauvau, de Lur-Saluces, d'Haussonville, de Noailles, de Chabot, de Turenne,[3309]
and other bearers of historic names.--During the Revolution, at each new parliamentarian, popular
or military coup d'état the notabilities of the vanquished party were always excluded from
office and generally outlawed. After the coup d'état of Brumaire, not only are the vanquished
of the old parties all brought back under the protection of the law, but, again, their notables
are promoted to the highest offices. Among the monarchists of the Constituent Assembly Mabuet
is made councilor of State, and Maury archbishop of Paris; forty-seven other ecclesiastics
who, like himself, refused to take the oath to the civil constitution of the clergy, are appointed,
like him, to episcopal thrones. Among the Feuillants of the Legislative Assembly, Vaublanc
is made prefect, Beugnot a councilor of State and minister of the finances in the grand-duchy
of Berg, Matthieu Dumas a brigadier-general and director of reviews, Narbonne becomes the aid-de-camp
and the intimate interlocutor of Napoleon, and then ambassador to Vienna; if Lafayette had
been willing, not to ask for but to accept the post, he would have been made a marshal of France.--Among
the few Girondists or Federalists who did not perish after the 2nd June, Riouffe is prefect
and baron, Lanjuinais is senator and count; among others proscribed, or half proscribed, the
new Régime restores to and places at the head of affairs the superior and special employees
whom the Reign of Terror had driven away, or singled out for slaughter, particularly the heads
of the financial and diplomatic services who, denounced by Robespierre on the 8th Thermidor,
or arrested on the morning of the 9th already felt their necks under the blade of the guillotine;
Reinhart and Otto are ambassadors, Mollien is count and treasury minister, Miot becomes councilor
of state, Comte de Melito minister of finances at Naples, while Gaudin is made minister of
finances in France and Duc de Gaëte. Among the transported or fugitives of Fructidor, Barthélemy
becomes senator, Barbé-Marbois director of the Treasury and first president of the Cour des
Comptes; Siméon, councilor of State and then minister of justice in Westphalia; Portalis is
made minister of worship, and Fontanes grand-master of the University. The First Consul passes
the sponge over all political antecedents: not only does he summon to his side the moderates
and half-moderates of the Constituent and Legislative Assemblies, of the Convention and of
the Directory, but again he seeks recruits among pure royalists and pure Jacobins, among the
men the most devoted to the ancient Régime and amongst those most compromised by the Revolution,
at both extremities of the most extreme opinions. We have just seen, on the one side, what
hereditary favorites of a venerable royalty, what born supporters of the deposed dynasty, are
elevated by him to the first of his magisterial, clerical and court dignities. On the other
hand, apart from Chasset, Roederer and Grégoire, apart from Fourcroy, Bérlier and Réal, apart
from Treilhard and Boulay de La Meurthe, he employs others branded or noted for terrible acts,
Barère himself, at least for a certain period, and in the sole office he was fitted for, that
of a denunciator, gazetteer and stimulator of public opinion; everybody has a place according
to his faculties, and each has rank according to his usefulness and merit. Barère, consequently,
becomes a paid spy and pamphleteer; Drouet, the postmaster, who arrested the royal family at
Varennes, becomes sub-prefect at Sainte-Menehould; Jean-Bon Saint-André, one of the Committee
of Public Safety, is made prefect at Mayence; Merlin de Douai, reporter of the law against
suspects, is prosecuting attorney in the court of cassation; Fouché, whose name tells all,
becomes minister of state and Duke of Otranto; nearly all of the survivors of the Convention
are made judges of première instance or of appeal, revenue-collectors, deputies, prefects,
foreign consuls, police commissioners, inspectors of reviews, head-clerks in the post-offices,
custom-houses and tax-offices, while, in 1808, among these functionaries, one hundred and thirty
were regicides.[3310]

II. Ambitions during the Ancient Regime.

     The need of success.--Initiation and conditions of promotion
     under the old monarchy.--Effect on minds.--Ambitions are
     limited.--The external outlets open to them.

To make one's way, get ahead, and succeed in the world is now the dominant thought in the minds
of men. Before 1789, this thought had not acquired sovereign control in their minds; it found
that there were rival ideas to contend with, and it had only half-developed itself; its roots
had not sunk down deep enough to monopolize the activity of the imagination, to absorb the
will and possess the mind entirely; and the reason is that it lacked both air and victuals.
Promotion, under the old monarchy, was slow, and in the first place, because the monarchy was
old and because in every order which is not new each new generation finds that every office
is filled, and next, because, in this old order founded on tradition and heredity, future vacancies
were supplied long beforehand. The great social staircase led to several stories; each man
could ascend every step of his own flight, but he could not mount above it; the landing reached,
he found closed doors and nearly insurmountable barriers. The story above was reserved to its
own inhabitants; they occupied it now and were still to occupy it in time to come; the inevitable
successors of the titular possessor were seen around him on each step, his equals, peers and
neighbors, one or the other often designated by name as his legal heir, the purchaser of his
survivorship. In those days, not only was the individual himself considered, his merits and
his services, but likewise his family and ancestry, his state and condition, the society he
entered into, the "salon" he maintained, his fortune and his followers; these antecedents and
surroundings composed the quality of the personage; without this requisite quality, he could
not go beyond the landing-place. Strictly speaking, a personage born on the upper steps of
one story might sometimes succeed in mounting the lowest steps of the next story, but there
he stopped. In short, it was always considered by those on the lower story that the upper story
was inaccessible and, moreover, uninhabitable.

Accordingly, most of the public offices, in the finances, in the administration, in the judiciary,
in the parliaments, in the army, at court, were private property as is now the case with the
places of advocates, notaries and brokers; they had to be bought to enable one to follow these
pursuits, and were very dear; one had to possess a large capital and be content beforehand
to derive only a mediocre revenue from it, 10, 5 and sometimes 3 % on the purchase-money.[3311]
The place once acquired, especially if an important one, involved official parade, receptions,
an open table, a large annual outlay;[3312] it often ran the purchaser in debt; he knew that
his acquisition would bring him more consideration than crowns. On the other hand, to obtain
possession of it, he had to secure the good-will of the body of which he became a member, or
of the patron who bestowed the office. That is to say, he must be regarded by his future colleagues
as acceptable, or by the patron as a guest, invited, and feasible friend, in other words, provide
sponsors for himself, furnish guarantees, prove that he was well-off and well-educated, that
his ways and manners qualified him for the post, and that, in the society he was about to enter,
he would not turn out unsuitable. To maintain one's self in office at court one was obliged
to possess the tone of Versailles, quite different from that of Paris and the provinces.[3313]
To maintain one's self in a high parliamentary position, one was expected to possess local
alliances, moral authority, the traditions and deportment handed down from father to son in
the old magistrate families, and which a mere advocate, an ordinary pleader, could not arrive
at.[3314] In short, on this staircase, each distinct story imposed on its inmates a sort of
distinct costume, more or less costly, embroidered and gilded, I mean a sum of outward and
inward habits and connections, all obligatory and indispensable, comprising title, particle
and name: the announcement of any bourgeois name by a lackey in the ante-chamber would be considered
a discord; consequently, one had one's self ennobled in the current coin, or assumed a noble
name gratis. Caron, son of a watchmaker, became Beaumarchais; Nicolas, a foundling, called
himself M. de Champfort; Danton, in public documents, signed himself d'Anton; in the same way,
a man without a dress-coat hires or borrows one, no matter how, on going out to dine; all this
was tolerated and accepted as a sign of good behavior and of final conformity with custom,
as in testimony of respect for the usages of good society.

Through this visible separation of stories, people had acquired the habit of remaining in the
condition in which they were placed; they were not irritated by being obliged to stay in it;
the soldier who enlisted did not aspire to become an officer; the young officer of the lower
noblesse and of small means did not aspire to the post of colonel or lieutenant-general; a
limited perspective kept hopes and the imagination from fruitlessly launching forth into a
boundless future: ambition, humbled to the ground at the start, walked instead of flying; it
recognized at the outset that the summits were beyond its reach; to be able to mount upward
one or two steps was enough.--In general, a man obtained promotion on the spot, in his town,
corporation or parliament. The assistant-counselor who pleaded his first case in the court
of Grenoble or of Rennes calculated that, in twenty years, he would become first judge at Grenoble
or at Rennes, rest twenty years or more in office, and he aimed at nothing better. Alongside
of the counselor of a (court) presidency, or of an "election" magistrate, of a clerk in the
salt-tax bureau, or in the frontier custom-house, or in the bureau of "rivers and forests,"
alongside of a clerk in the treasury or ministry of foreign affairs, or of a lawyer or prosecuting
attorney, there was always some son, son-in-law or nephew, fitted by domestic training, by
a technical apprenticeship, by moral adaptation, not only to perform the duties of the office,
but to be contented in it, pretend to nothing beyond it, not to look above himself with regret
or envy, satisfied with the society around him, and feel, moreover, that elsewhere he would
be out of his element and uncomfortable.

Life, thus restricted and circumscribed, was more cheerful then than at the present day; souls,
less disturbed and less strained, less exhausted and less burdened with cares, were healthier.
The Frenchman, exempt from modern preoccupations, followed amiable and social instincts, inclined
to take things easily, and of a playful disposition owing to his natural talent for amusing
himself by amusing others, in mutual enjoyment of each other's company and without calculation,
through easy and considerate intercourse, smiling or laughing, in short, in a constant flow
of inspiration, good-humor and gayety.[3315] It is probable that, if the Revolution had not
intervened, the great parvenus of the time and of the Empire would, like their forerunners,
have submitted to prevailing necessities and readily accommodated themselves to the discipline
of the established Régime. Cambacérès, who had succeeded to his father as counselor at the
bar of Montpellier, would have become president (of the tribunal) in his turn; meanwhile, he
would have composed able jurisprudential treatises and invented some new pâté de becfigues;
Lebrun, former collaborator with Maupeou, might have become counselor in the court of excise
at Paris, or chief-clerk in the Treasury department; he would have kept up a philosophical
salon, with fashionable ladies and polished men of letters to praise his elegant and faulty
translations. Amongst the future marshals, some of them, pure plebeians, Masséna, Augereau,
Lannes, Ney, Lefebvre, might have succeeded through brilliant actions and have become "officers
of fortune," while others, taking in hand specially difficult services, like commandant Fischer
who undertook the destruction of Mandrin's band, and again, like the hero Chevert, and the
veteran Lückner, might have become lieutenant-generals. Rough as these men were, they would
have found, even in the lower ranks, if not full employment for their superior faculties, at
least sufficient food for their strong and coarse appetites; they would have uttered just the
same oaths, at just as extravagant suppers, with mistresses of just the same caliber.[3316]
Had their temperament, character and genius been indomitable, had they reared and pranced to
escape bridle and harness and been driven like ordinary men, they need not have broken out
of the traces for all that; there were plenty of openings and issues for them on either side
of the highway on which others were trotting along. Many families often contained, among numerous
children, some hot-headed, imaginative youth, some independent nature rebellious in advance,
in short, a refractory spirit, unwilling or incapable of being disciplined; a regular life,
mediocrity, even the certainty of getting ahead, were distasteful to him; he would abandon
the hereditary homestead or purchased office to the docile elder brother, son-in-law or nephew,
by which the domain or the post remained in the family; as for himself, tempted by illimitable
prospects, he would leave France and go abroad; Voltaire says[3317] that "Frenchmen were found
everywhere," in Canada, in Louisiana, as surgeons, fencing-masters, riding-masters, officers,
engineers, adventurers especially, and even filibusters, trappers and backwoodsmen, the supplest,
most sympathetic and boldest of colonizers and civilizers, alone capable of bringing the natives
under assimilation by assimilating with them, by adopting their customs and by marrying their
women, mixing bloods, and forming new and intermediary races, like Dumas de La Pailleterie,
whose descendants have furnished original and superior men for the past three generations,
and like the Canada half-breeds by which the aboriginal race succeeds in transforming itself
and in surviving. They were the first explorers of the great lakes, the first to trace the
Mississippi to its mouth, and found colonial empires with Champlain and Lasalle in North America
and with Dupleix and La Bourdonnais in Hindustan. Such was the outlet for daring, uncontrollable
spirits, restive temperaments under constraint and subject to the routine of an old civilization,
souls astray and unclassed from their birth, in which the primitive instincts of the nomad
and barbarian sprouted afresh, in which insubordination was innate, and in which energy and
capacity to take the initiative remained intact.--Mirabeau, having compromised his family by
scandals, was on the point of being dispatched by his father to the Dutch Indies, where deaths
were common; it might happen that he would be hanged or become governor of some large district
in Java or Sumatra, the venerated and adored sovereign of five hundred thousand Malays, both
ends being within the compass of his merits. Had Danton been well advised, instead of borrowing
the money with which to buy an advocate's place in the Council at about seventy thousand livres,
which brought him only three cases in four years and obliged him to hang on to the skirts of
his father-in-law, he would have gone to Pondicherry or to the palace of some indigenous rajah
or king as agent, councilor or companion of his pleasures; he might have become prime-minister
to Tippoo Sahib, or other potentate, lived in a palace, kept a harem and had lacs of rupees;
undoubtedly, he would have filled his prisons and occasionally emptied them by a massacre,
as at Paris in September, but it would have been according to local custom, and operating only
on the lives of Sheikhs and Mahrattas. Bonaparte, after the fall of his protectors, the two
Robespierres, finding his career arrested, wanted to enter the Sultan's service; accompanied
by Junot, Muiron, Marmont and other comrades, he could have carried to Constantinople rarer
commodities, much better compensated in the Orient than in the Occident, namely military honor
and administrative talent; he would have dealt in these two products, as he did in Egypt, at
the right time and in the right place, at the highest price, without our conscientious scruples
and without our European refinements of probity and humanity.
