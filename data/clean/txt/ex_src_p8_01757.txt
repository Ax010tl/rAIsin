The mammals are less known than those from some of the bordering states; for the most part
collecting has been limited to a few localities, chiefly along the Pan-American Highway. Accordingly,
as a step towards a long-range study of the mammals of Tamaulipas, the Museum of Natural History
of the University of Kansas acquired from William J. Schaldach, Jr., a small, but significant,
collection of mammals taken in the last month of 1949 and the first four months of 1950.

Collections were made at several places in the vicinity of Ciudad Victoria, including localities
along the humid, eastern face of the Sierra Madre Oriental. Many of these specimens were obtained
near camps made west of the village of El Carrizo. This small community is on the Pan-American
highway, 70 kilometers (by highway) south of Ciudad Victoria. The resulting collections, which
are reported upon here, disclose that several tropical mammals range farther northward than
previously reported. Funds for financing the field work were made available by a grant from
the Kansas University Endowment Association.

ACCOUNTS OF SPECIES

~Didelphis mesamericana mesamericana~ Oken

Central American Opossum

     Did[elphys] mes-americana Oken, Lehrbuch d. Naturgesch.,
     pt. 3, vol. 2:1152, 1816. (Type from Northern Mexico.)

     Didelphis mes-americana Allen, Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat.
     Hist., 16:256, August 18, 1902.

     Specimens examined, 2 as follows: 36 km. N and 10 km. W
     Ciudad Victoria, 1 km. E El Barretal, on Río Purificacíon,
     1; 12 km. N and 4 km. W Ciudad Victoria, 1.

~Philander opossum pallidus~ (Allen)

Four-eyed Opossum

     Metachirus fuscogriseus pallidus Allen, Bull. Amer. Mus.
     Nat. Hist., 14:215, July 3, 1901. (Type from Orizaba,
     Veracruz, Mexico.)

     Philander opossum pallidus Dalquest, Occ. Papers Mus.
     Zool., Louisiana State Univ., No. 23:2, July 10, 1950.

     Specimens examined, 3 from 70 km. [by highway] S Ciudad
     Victoria and 2 km. W El Carrizo.

Remarks.--These three specimens have proportionately longer tails than typical P. o. pallidus
from central Veracruz; total length and length of tail of two adult males are 575, 295, and
568, 290 respectively.

This marsupial has been previously unrecorded from Tamaulipas or from so northward a locality.
The four-eyed opossum evidently ranges northward along the east face of the Sierra Madre Oriental
within the humid division of the Upper Tropical Life-zone. These animals, all males, were taken
in steel traps baited with the bodies of skinned mice or birds. Sets were made along well-used
trails leading from a densely vegetated arroyo into a corn field through openings in a fence
of roughly piled logs. The elevation of this locality is approximately 2500 feet.

~Desmodus rotundus murinus~ Wagner

Vampire Bat

     D[esmodus] murinus Wagner, Schreber's Säugthiere, Suppl.,
     1:377, 1840. (Type from Mexico.)

     Desmodus rotundus murinus Osgood, Field Mus. Nat. Hist.,
     publ. 155, zool. ser., 10:63, January 10, 1912.

     Specimens examined, 9 as follows: 12 km. W and 8 km. N

     Victoria and 6 km. W of the [Pan-American] highway [at El
     Carrizo], 6.

Remarks.--Vampire bats were taken at two caves. At the cave called "Los Troncones", 12 kilometers
west and 8 kilometers north of Ciudad Victoria, seven bats were shot down; three were saved.
The second cave, south of Ciudad Victoria, was considerably damper than the first. Vampires
were found in a small side chamber; nine bats were knocked down. No other kinds of bats were
present in either cave.

~Sylvilagus floridanus connectens~ (Nelson)

Florida Cottontail

     Lepus floridanus connectens Nelson, Proc. Biol. Soc.
     Washington, 17:105, May 18, 1904. (Type from Chichicaxtle,
     Veracruz, Mexico.)

     Sylvilagus floridanus connectens Lyon and Osgood, Catal.
     Type spec. Mamm. U. S. Nat. Mus., Bull. 62:32, January 28,
     1909.

     Specimens examined, 2 from 70 km. [by highway] S. Ciudad
     Victoria and 2 km. W El Carrizo.

~Sciurus aureogaster aureogaster~ F. Cuvier

Red-bellied Squirrel

     [Sciurus, by implication] aureogaster F. Cuvier, Hist.
     nat. mammifères, vol. 6, livr. 59, pl. with text, September,
     1829. Binomial published at end of work only, vol. 7, tabl.
     generale et méthodique, p. 4, 1842. (Type from "California"
     = eastern Mexico.)

     Specimens examined, 13 as follows: 43 km. S Ciudad
     Victoria, 1; 70 km. [by highway] S Ciudad Victoria, and 6
     km. W of [Pan-American] highway [at El Carrizo], 3; 70 km.
     [by hwy.] S Victoria and 2 km. W El Carrizo, 9.

Remarks.--These colorful squirrels were taken in thick timber and brush, and locally are referred
to as "ardilla pinta" or "ardilla colorada." One female obtained on January 22 is black. Local
hunters state that these squirrels are most active early in the morning and late in the afternoon.
Two squirrels were seen in copulation on January 19.

~Sciurus negligens~ Nelson

Little Gray Squirrel

     Sciurus negligens Nelson, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington,
     12:147, June 3, 1898. (Type from Alta Mira, Tamaulipas,
     Mexico.)

     Specimens examined, 17 as follows: 70 km. [by highway] S
     of Ciudad Victoria and 6 km. W of the [Pan-American] highway
     [at El Carrizo], 5; 70 km. [by highway] S Ciudad Victoria
     and 2 km. W El Carrizo, 12.

Remarks.--Referred to as "ardilla chica" locally, these squirrels were most frequently seen
in the dense forest of the lower, elevations. Active both in trees and on the ground, these
animals were reported as being destructive to corn crops. Females taken in January were lactating.

~Heterogeomys hispidus concavus~ Nelson and Goldman

Hispid Pocket Gopher

     Heterogeomys hispidus concavus Nelson and Goldman, Proc.
     Biol. Soc. Washington, 42:148, March 30, 1929. (Type from
     Pinal de Amoles, Queretaro, Mexico.)

     Specimens examined, 5 as follows: 70 km. [by highway] S
     Ciudad Victoria and 5 km. W El Carrizo, 4; 70 km. [by
     highway] S Ciudad Victoria and 2 km. W El Carrizo, 1.

Remarks.--These gophers have been compared with specimens of H. h. hispidus from Veracruz (5
km. N Jalapa and 4 km. WNW Fortin) and with specimens of H. h. concavus from San Luis Potosí
(Xilitla and vicinity and 3 mi. NW Pujal); the latter were examined through the courtesy of
Dr. George H. Lowery, Jr., of the Museum of Zoology at Louisiana State University. These five
specimens are assigned to H. h. concavus and resemble in every way this subspecies except:
slightly smaller, somewhat darker, and skull with lambdoidal crest less inclined forward. In
the latter feature, the single skull available seems to resemble most closely that of H. h.
hispidus. Unfortunately, all but one skull, that of a subadult female, were destroyed in the field.

This is the first known record of this genus in Tamaulipas and the most northern locality from
which specimens have been taken. At this latitude, the gopher appears to be restricted to the
humid belt on the east face of the Sierra Madre Oriental. These large gophers were difficult
to trap by ordinary means; Schaldach got two by using large-sized Macabee traps but the others
were taken at night either with the aid of a dog or by natives with slingshots.

~Liomys irroratus texensis~ Merriam

Spiny Pocket Mouse

     Liomys texensis Merriam, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington,
     15:44, March 5, 1902. (Type from Brownsville, Cameron
     County, Texas.)

     Liomys irroratus texensis Goldman, N. Amer. Fauna, 34:59,
     September 7, 1911.

     Specimens examined, 15 as follows: 7 km. S and 2 km. W San
     Fernando, 8; 36 km. N and 10 km. W Ciudad Victoria, 1 km. E
     El Barretal, on Río Purificacíon, 1; 70 km. [by highway] S
     Ciudad Victoria and 2 km. W El Carrizo, 6.

Remarks.--Most of these mice were taken in densely vegetated fallow fields, where both grass
and brush were found. Many of the mice were captured at their burrow openings, some of which
were found to be plugged and others not plugged.

~Reithrodontomys fulvescens intermedius~ Allen

Fulvous Harvest Mouse

     Reithrodontomys mexicanus intermedius Allen, Bull. Amer.
     Mus. Nat. Hist., 7:136, May 21, 1895. (Type from
     Brownsville, Cameron County, Texas.)

     Reithrodontomys fulvescens intermedius Howell, N. Amer.
     Fauna, 36:47, June 5, 1914.

     Specimen examined, 1 from 70 km. [by highway] S Ciudad
     Victoria and 2 km. W El Carrizo.

~Baiomys taylori taylori~ (Thomas)

Pygmy Mouse

     Hesperomys (Vesperimus) taylori Thomas, Ann. and Mag. Nat.
     Hist, ser. 5, 19:66, January, 1887. (Type from San Diego,
     Duval County, Texas.)

     April 13, 1907.

     Specimens examined, 2 from 70 km. [by highway] S Ciudad
     Victoria and 2 km. W El Carrizo.

Remarks.--Specimens were captured in runways in dense grass and weeds at the edge of a corn field.

~Peromyscus leucopus texanus~ (Woodhouse)

White-footed Mouse

     Hesperomys texana Woodhouse, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci.
     Philadelphia, 6:242, 1853. (Type probably from the vicinity
     of Mason, Mason County, Texas.)

     Peromyscus leucopus texanus Osgood, N. Amer. Fauna,
     28:127, April 17, 1909.

     Specimens examined, 8 as follows: 7 km. S and 2 km. W San
     Fernando, 1; 12 km. N and 4 km. W Ciudad Victoria, 2; 70 km.
     [by highway] S Ciudad Victoria and 2 km. W El Carrizo, 4.

~Peromyscus ochraventer~ new species

Brown-bellied Wood Mouse

     Type.--Female, adult, skin and skull; no. 36958, Univ.
     Kansas Mus. Nat. Hist.; 70 km. [by highway] S Ciudad
     Victoria and 6 km. W of the [Pan-American] highway [at El
     Carrizo], Tamaulipas, Mexico; 12 January 1950; obtained by
     William J. Schaldach, Jr., original no. 566.

     Range.--Known only from the type locality; probably found
     in other localities along the humid, east face of the Sierra
     Madre Oriental in Tamaulipas.

     Diagnosis.--Size medium (see measurements); upper parts
     near Ochraceous Tawny (capitalized color terms after
     Ridgway, Color Standards and Color Nomenclature, Washington,
     D. C., 1912), brighter on sides and duller on back; cheeks,
     sides of neck, shoulders and upper forelegs lighter, between
     Ochraceous Buff and Ochraceous Orange; eye ring dark;
     underparts light Cinnamon Buff, breast patch brighter; ears
     dusky, sparsely covered with hairs colored like back; feet
     white; tail scaly in appearance, indistinctly bicolored with
     short dark hairs above and short pale hairs below; skull
     without beaded or ridged supraorbital border; rostrum
     expanded anteriorly with sides almost parallel; teeth with
     strongly developed outer accessory cusps on the first and
     second upper molar teeth; anteriormost loph
     (parastyle-protoconule of Goldman, N. Amer. Fauna, 43:11,
     September 23, 1918) of the first upper molar large, almost
     as broad as greatest breadth of tooth.

     Comparisons.--Peromyscus ochraventer has been compared
     with P. difficilis (specimens from Veracruz), P. boylei
     (Veracruz), P. banderanus (Guerrero), P. mexicanus
     (Veracruz), P. furvus (Veracruz), and P. latirostris
     (San Luis Potosí). From P. difficilis, P. ochraventer
     differs in having underparts distinctively brownish, rostrum
     expanded anteriorly with sides almost parallel, anteriormost
     loph of the first upper molar larger, and auditory bulla
     smaller. From P. boylei, P. ochraventer differs in
     having underparts distinctively brownish, tail less
     distinctly bicolored, rostrum expanded anteriorly with sides
     almost parallel, and anteriormost loph of the first upper
     molar larger. From P. banderanus, P. ochraventer differs
     in having underparts distinctively brownish, tail less
     distinctly bicolored, rostrum expanded anteriorly with sides
     almost parallel, anteriormost loph of the first upper molar
     larger, auditory bulla smaller, and in lacking a beaded or
     ridged supraorbital border. From P. mexicanus, P.
     ochraventer differs in having underparts distinctively
     brownish, tail not irregularly blotched with dusky, rostrum
     expanded anteriorly with sides almost parallel, anteriormost
     loph of the first upper molar larger, and in lacking a
     beaded or ridged supraorbital border. From P. furvus and
     P. latirostris, P. ochraventer differs in being smaller,
     having underparts distinctively brownish, tail not
     irregularly blotched with dusky, rostrum proportionately
     shorter, and interpterygoid space relatively narrower.

Remarks.--Peromyscus ochraventer is considered to be a distinct species showing little evident
relationship with other Mexican Peromyscus. In the shape of the skull, especially the anterior
expansion of the rostrum, P. ochraventer seems to be related to P. furvus and P. latirostris,
a series of the latter being made available for examination by Dr. George G. Lowery, Jr., of
the Museum of Zoology at Louisiana State University. However, the rostrum of these two larger
species is proportionately longer than the rostrum of P. ochraventer. In size, coloration and
most cranial features, P. ochraventer resembles P. mexicanus, although the absence, instead
of presence, of a supraorbital bead or ridge, the almost parallel-sided, instead of more pointed,
rostrum and the larger, instead of smaller, interiormost loph of the first upper molar in P.
ochraventer are well-marked differences. The baculum of P. ochraventer is much shorter with
a proportionately heavier base and shaft than the baculum of P. mexicanus mexicanus (from Veracruz)
and P. m. saxatilis (from Costa Rica). The geographic range of Peromyscus ochraventer is not
known to meet that of P. mexicanus; the nearest place to the type locality of P. ochraventer
from which P. mexicanus has been taken is at Xilitla approximately 225 kilometers to the southward
in San Luis Potosí (Dalquest, Occ. Papers Mus. Zool., Louisiana State Univ., No. 28:8, July
10, 1950).

The brown coloring on the underparts is a distinctive feature of P. ochraventer; in adults
this color differs in shade. In some specimens patches of whitish hair give the tail a splotched
appearance. Eleven of the twenty-eight skulls and lower jaws examined have bone eroded away
from around the cheek-teeth exposing part of the roots. Most of the fully adult animals have
this condition. One adult female, no. 36959, has the upper third molar on the right side missing,
possibly as a result of bone erosion.

These mice were taken in junglelike forest, in rocks and adjacent to logs. Schaldach writes
that "Their burrows go back under the large limestone blocks, and each burrow where I caught
a mouse has a pile of excavated earth, like a tiny gopher mound." The trapping area was at
an elevation of approximately 2800 feet on the steep sides of a small hill on top of which
the field camp was situated. Schaldach indicated that this locality was transitional between
arid tropical and humid tropical conditions. On January 13, 1950, a female taken was lactating
and had five recent placental scars; another taken the same day also had five placental scars.

     Measurements.--Average and extreme measurements of seven
     adult males and six adult females of P. ochraventer from
     the type locality are, respectively, as follows: Total
     length, 238.0 (227-249), 236.5 (226-248); length of tail,
     124.4 (117-127), 122.2 (116-128); length of hind foot, 25.6
     (24-26), 25.5 (25-26); length of ear from notch, 20.9
     (20-21), 20.7 (20-21); greatest length of skull, 31.0
     (30.6-31.9), 30.8 (30.5-31.0); basilar length, 23.3
     (22.7-23.8), 23.4 (23.0-23.9); zygomatic breadth, 15.1
     (14.6-15.7), 15.0 (14.9-15.2); post palatal length, 10.6
     (10.5-10.9), 10.9 (10.5-11.2); interorbital breadth, 4.7
     (4.5-4.9), 4.7 (4.6-4.8); mastoidal breadth, 12.8
     (12.4-13.2), 12.8 (12.6-12.9); length of nasals, 11.6
     (10.8-12.0), 11.6 (11.2-11.7); length of shelf of bony
     palate, 4.7 (4.5-4.8), 4.6 (4.5-4.7); length of palatine
     slits, 6.3 (6.0-6.5), 6.2 (6.0-6.4); length of diastema, 8.2
     (8.0-8.5), 8.2 (8.1-8.4); alveolar length of upper
     molariform tooth-row, 4.4 (4.3-4.6), 4.4 (4.3-4.5).

     Specimens examined, 28, from the type locality.

~Oryzomys couesi aquaticus~ Allen

Coues Rice Rat

     Oryzomys aquaticus Allen, Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist.,
     3:289, June 30, 1891. (Type from Brownsville, Cameron
     County, Texas.)

     Oryzomys couesi aquaticus Goldman, N. Amer. Fauna, 43:39,
     September 23, 1918.

     Specimens examined, 2 as follows: 36 km. N and 10 km. W
     Ciudad Victoria, 1 km. E El Barretal, on Río Purificacíon,
     1; 70 km. [by highway] S Ciudad Victoria and 6 km. W of the
     [Pan-American] highway [at El Carrizo], 1.

Remarks.--The specimens, all immatures, are slightly darker than topotypes of O. c. aquaticus,
seemingly tending toward the darker O. c. peragrus Merriam to the southward. These records
of occurrence extend the known range of this subspecies approximately 210 miles to the southward
and increase the possibility of continuous distribution between O. c. aquaticus and O. c. peragrus.

The male obtained south of Ciudad Victoria was taken on January 12, by William J. Shaldach,
Jr., 200 yards within the tunnel of a mine at an elevation of approximately 2600 feet. This
was in the Sierra Gorda, which is a part of the Sierra Madre Oriental.

~Oryzomys rostratus rostratus~ Merriam

Rice Rat

     Oryzomys rostratus Merriam, Proc. Washington Acad. Sci.,
     3:293, July 26, 1901. (Type from Metlaltoyuca, Pueblo,
     Mexico.)

     Specimen examined, 1 from 70 km. [by highway] S Ciudad
     Victoria and 2 km. W El Carrizo.

Remarks.--This immature male is paler than specimens of O. r. rostratus from the state of Veracruz.
This locality extends the known range of this species northward a distance of approximately
100 miles. Previously it had been recorded from only as far north as Alta Mira, Tamaulipas
(Goldman, N. Amer. Fauna, 43:54, September 23, 1918). This specimen was trapped on February
16 in a rodent runway in dense grass in a fallow cane field.

~Oryzomys fulvescens engraciae~ Osgood

Fulvous Rice Rat

     Oryzomys fulvescens engraciae Osgood, Jour. Mamm., 26:300,
     November 14, 1945. (Type from Hacienda Santa Engracia,
     northwest of Ciudad Victoria, Tamaulipas, Mexico.)

     Specimens examined, 5 from 70 km. [by highway] S Ciudad
     Victoria and 2 km. E El Carrizo.

Remarks.--These specimens are referred to O. f. engraciae on the basis of their pale color
and narrow interorbital space. They were taken in runways in dense grass in fallow cane fields.

~Sigmodon hispidus toltecus~ (Saussure)

Hispid Cotton Rat

     [Hesperomys] toltecus Saussure, Revue et magasin de
     zoologie, ser. 2, 12:98, 1860. (Type from mountains of
     Veracruz, Mexico.)

     Sigmodon hispidus toltecus Bailey, Proc. Biol. Soc.
     Washington, 15:110, June 2, 1902.

     Specimens examined, 23 as follows: 36 km. N and 10 km. W
     Ciudad Victoria, 1 km. E El Barretal, on Río Purificacíon,
     1; 70 km. [by highway] S Ciudad Victoria and 2 km. W El
     Carrizo, 22.

Remarks.--Among named kinds of Sigmodon this series most closely approaches S. h. toltecus
to the southward. The specimens are slightly lighter in color of the upper parts than are examples
of this same subspecies from 8 km. NW of Potrero, Veracruz, but in other ways are similar.
The single specimen from 36 km. N and 10 km. W Ciudad Victoria is a skull only, but seems closest
to S. h. toltecus. As is often the case with collections of Sigmodon, this series contains
mostly immatures.

Cotton rats were found abundantly in cultivated areas. Local farmers stated that these rats
were destructive to sugar cane by girdling the stems one and one-half inches above the ground.

~Neotoma micropus micropus~ Baird

Baird Wood Rat

     Neotoma micropus Baird, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci.
     Philadelphia, p. 333, April, 1855. (Type from Charco
     Escondido, Tamaulipas, Mexico.)

     Specimens examined, 2 from 7 km. S and 2 km. W San
     Fernando.

~Neotoma angustapalata~ new species

Tamaulipan Wood Rat

     Type.--Male, subadult, skin and skull; No. 36976, Univ.
     Kansas Mus. Nat. Hist.; 70 km. [by highway] S Ciudad
     Victoria and 6 km. W of the [Pan-American] highway [at El
     Carrizo], Tamaulipas, Mexico; 14 January 1950; obtained by
     William J. Schaldach, Jr., original no. 578.

     Range.--Known only from the type locality; probably found
     in other localities along the humid, east face of the Sierra
     Madre Oriental in Tamaulipas.

     Diagnosis.--Size large (see measurements); upper parts
     dusky brown, paler on sides, individual hairs on middle of
     back tipped with black or with Light Pinkish Cinnamon
     (capitalized color term after Ridgway, Color Standards and
     Color Nomenclature, Washington, D. C., 1912); head grayer
     especially on cheeks; underparts dusky (dark bases of
     white-tipped hairs exposed), hairs on throat and inguinal
     region of adult specimen white to base; outside of legs
     dusky gray; tail scaly in appearance and sparsely covered
     with short, blackish hairs above and short, whitish hairs
     below; skull with auditory bulla large; external auditory
     meatus large; palatine region narrow; sides of
     interpterygoid fossa concave and broadly excavated near
     posterior end of molariform tooth-rows.

     Comparison.--Neotoma angustapalata has been compared
     with N. torquata (specimens from Veracruz and Puebla), N.
     navus (Coahuila), N. mexicana (New Mexico), N. micropus
     (Tamaulipas), N. albigula (Coahuila), N. ferruginea
     (Jalisco), and N. distincta (from published description in
     Goldman, N. Amer. Fauna, 31:64, October 19, 1910). Neotoma
     angustapalata differs from N. micropus and N. albigula
     in having a deep, instead of a shallow, anterointernal
     reentrant angle on the first upper molar and seems to belong
     to the N. mexicana group of wood rats. Neotoma
     angustapalata differs from N. navus, N. mexicana, N.
     torquata, and N. ferruginea in larger size, darker
     underparts, tail with sparse, short hairs and scaly
     appearance, more broadly concave sides of interpterygoid
     fossa at posterior end of molariform tooth-rows, larger
     external auditory meatus, and narrower palatine breadth.
     Neotoma angustapalata differs from the description of N.
     distincta in having a faintly bicolored tail, no ochraceous
     pectoral band, broadly concave sides to interpterygoid
     fossa, and narrower palatine breadth.

Remarks.--Neotoma angustapalata is represented by two specimens; the type and another specimen,
an adult male, no. 37062, with skin and broken skull. The description takes into account both
of these specimens. The most significant characteristics of N. angustapalata are its scaly-appearing
tail with short, sparse hairs, dusky underparts, broadly concave sides of the interpterygoid
fossa at the posterior end of molariform tooth-rows, and the narrow palatine breadth. Among
named kinds of Neotoma, the newly named species most closely resembles N. torquata and N. distincta;
however, it is geographically widely separated from these two species. Neotoma navus of southeastern
Coahuila is the only other member of the N. mexicana group in northeastern Mexico.

These wood rats were taken in rocks and crevices at the base of a small hill in thick vegetation
growing in deep humus. Schaldach termed the trapping site as "arid tropical tending toward
humid tropical".

     Measurements.--The subadult, male holotype measures as
     follows: Total length, 325; length of tail, 154; length of
     hind foot, 36; length of ear from notch, 29; basilar length
     (of skull), 33.9; zygomatic breadth, 22.1; interorbital
     breadth, 5.7; length of nasals, 15.2; length of incisive
     foramina, 8.7; length of palatal bridge, 8.5; least breadth
     of palate between first upper molars, 2.7; greatest breadth
