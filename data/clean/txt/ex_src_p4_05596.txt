THE PLAYS AND SHOWS.

Booth's Theatre has become famous as the place where Mr. MOLLENHAUER nightly leads his admirable
orchestra, and plays with exquisite skill and infinite tenderness his unrivalled violin solos.

Since this theatre opened, there have been several attempts to add dramatic entertainments
to the attractive concerts given by Mr. MOLLENHAUER. Two great actors, Mr. JEFFERSON and Mr.
BOOTH, have at different times appeared at this house, and in Rip Van Winkle and Hamlet have
given us the most perfect specimens of dramatic monologue. Lately, there was an attempt made
to present Macbeth during the intermissions in the performance of the orchestra. Had an actor
been engaged who was capable of playing Macbeth, and had a company been engaged to support
him, the tragedy would doubtless have been well played. There was really little else wanting
to make it a meritorious Shakespearean revival.

To visit this theatre is held to be a solemn duty by a large class of respectable and serious
people. They don't go for amusement--they are far too sensible for that--but they go to support
the legitimate drama, to testify their respect for SHAKESPEARE and for Mr. BOOTH'S classic
brow. The Worldly-Minded Persons who attended the representations of Macbeth, found themselves
assisting at a scene compared with which a funeral would have been jovial, and a hanging, a
wild dissipation.

This is the sort of thing that presents itself to our memory as we recall the first night of
Macbeth.

A large and elderly audience enters the portals with subdued and mournful mien. The ushers,
who, in imitation of Mr. BOOTH, do a little of the classic brow and curl business themselves,
chew tobacco with an air of resigned melancholy, and spit upon the carpet, as though renouncing
the pleasures of the world and the decencies of civilization.

At the first intermission of the orchestra, the curtain rises upon the three Weird Sisters.
Mr. HIND is a Weird Sister, and he improves the opportunity to howl with a weirdness that draws
an involuntary laugh from an irreverent young lady.

Respectable Father. "Laughing in BOOTH'S, my dear! I am astonished at you. Sh."

Respectable Mother. "Ellen, if you can't behave in ch--in the theatre, you ought not to come."
Irreverent young lady becomes an object of scornful pity to every one in the neighborhood.
She never smiles again.

The play proceeds. An inarticulate person is brought in on a litter, who looks like a Tammany
man whom some irate young Democrat has "put a head on." He indulges in an inarticulate speech,
which is warmly applauded by the gallery. Then the Weird Sisters meet MACBETH and BANQUO on
the heath, and Mr. HIND howls at them until the Worldly-Minded auditor blesses the memory of
the Salem witch-burners. Then the King brevets MACBETH. Then Lady MACBETH reads a letter from
her husband with the demonstrative energy of a Chicago Wild Woman reading the decree that divorces
her from a kind and honorable husband. Then the King arrives, and MACBETH and his wife agree
to kill him. Then the curtain falls, and Mr. MOLLENHAUER repays the Worldly-Minded Person for
having stayed through the first act. Conversation is indulged in by the audience in subdued
whispers.

All the Respectable Men in the house. "Ah! there is nothing like SHAKESPEARE, and there is
no theatre like BOOTH'S. This is indeed an intellectual feast."

All the Middle-aged Ladies, wiping away the tear of sensibility. "This is something worth seeing!
How can people be so frivolous as to go to see comedies?"

All the Young Ladies. "Isn't BOOTH perfectly splendid? Isn't he magnificent? You should have
seen his CLAUDE MELNOTTE; it was so perfectly lovely."

All the Ushers, each to the other. "Have another chew?"

Worldly-Minded Person to Congenial Reprobate. "Let's hear MOLLENHAUER once more, and then go."

But MOLLENHAUER'S violin ceases to weep, and the curtain rises again. The remainder of the
play proceeds in due solemnity. MACBETH has the usual fit of delirium tremens at the banquet
scene, where the nobility of Scotland--one of whom wears low shoes, Oxford tie pattern--drink
with national ardor, and don't take the slightest interest in MACBETH'S hallucinations. Lady
MACBETH afterward enjoys her own little private delirium in a gorgeous night-dress, and MACBETH
is finally done for by MACDUFF, who can outfight and outhowl him with perfect ease. The tragedy
being at last over, the audience disperses with solemn steps and slow; the men and elderly
ladies still whispering their stereotyped chorus of praise, and the young ladies adding to
their panegyrics of BOOTH ecstatic admiration of Lady MACBETH'S night-dress.

And the Worldly-Minded Person, walking homeward, soliloquizes in some such strain as this:
"BOOTH can't play MACBETH; for he neither looks nor understands the character. FANNY MORANT
can't play LADY MACBETH as perfectly as it should be played; but she tries to do her best,
and is quite respectable. Nobody else plays any part with common decency. But then the scenery
is good; the Scottish nobility look sufficiently hungry and seedy, and MOLLENHAUER is superb."

"Didn't somebody say of WASHINGTON that "Providence made him childless, that the nation might
call him father?" Somebody ought to say of Lady MACBETH that she was made childless, that no
one might call her mother-in-law. Neat thing that! Somebody ought to send it to PUNCHINELLO.
By Jove! what a mother-in-law that woman would have made. Or what a landlady; with the Weird
Sisters to prepare the morning hash!"

"Well! BOOTH can't do every thing; and we ought not to expect it. A man who plays HAMLET as
well as he does, can't possibly play MACBETH. As well might we ask TENNYSON to turn Ward politician.
We all owe him a debt of gratitude for building MOLLENHAUER so splendid a theatre, and for
giving us the best IAGO and the best HAMLET that we have ever seen, or ever shall see. And
so, I for one am ready to forget and forgive when be fails as MACBETH, and does not succeed
as ROMEO."

A TEMPERANCE SONG.

Strained Verses Dedicated to Unstrained Water.

BY A. FILTERER.

Bring a glass of sparkling water,
  Fill the goblet to the brim,
Let the microscopic critters
  Take in it a harmless swim.

Here are meat and drink united,
  Life, indeed, in this we see;
Who'd exchange so rich a fluid
  For the baser eau de vie?

Give us, then, no ale nor porter,
  Logwood wine, nor other drugs;
But a glass of sparkling water
  Filled with sportive little bugs.
