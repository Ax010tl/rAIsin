PREFACE

The principal authorities for the history of Coventry and its churches have been Dugdale's
"Antiquities of Warwickshire" and the "Illustrated Papers and the History and Antiquities of
the City of Coventry," by Thomas Sharp, edited by W.G. Fretton (1871). Besides these the many
papers by Mr. Fretton in the Transactions of the Birmingham and Midland Institute and other
Societies, and the "History and Antiquities of Coventry" by Benjamin Poole (1870) have been
the main sources of historical information. The Author is, however, responsible for the architectural
opinions and descriptions, which are mainly the outcome of a lifelong acquaintance with the
city and its buildings, fortified by several weeks of study and investigation recently undertaken.

He desires to acknowledge his deep obligations to the Vicars of the several churches for leave
to examine, measure and photograph the buildings in their charge; to Mr. J. Oldrid Scott for
the loan of drawings of St. Michael's; to Mr. A. Brown, Librarian of the Coventry Public Library
for advice and help in making use of the store of topographical material under his care; to
Mr. Owen, Verger of St. Michael's and Mr. Chapman, Verger of Holy Trinity, for help in various
directions, and to Mr. Wilfred Sims for his energy and care in taking most of the photographs
required for illustration.

The other illustrations are reproduced from drawings made by the author.

CHURCHES OF COVENTRY

MONASTERY AND CITY

The opening words of Sir William Dugdale's account of Coventry assert that it is a city "remarkable
for antiquity, charters, rights and privileges, and favours shown by monarchs." Though this
handbook is primarily concerned with a feature of the city he does not here mention--its magnificent
buildings--the history of these is bound up with that of the city. The connection of its great
parish churches with the everyday life of the people, though commonly on a narrower stage,
is more intimate than is that of a cathedral or an abbey church, but it is to be remembered
that without its Monastery Coventry might never have been more than a village or small market town.

We cannot expect the records of a parish church to be as full and complete as those of a cathedral,
always in touch through its bishops with the political life of the country and enjoying the
services of numerous officials; or as those of a monastery, with its leisured chroniclers ever
patiently recording the annals of their house, the doings of its abbots, the dealings of their
house with mother church and the outside world, and all its internal life and affairs. In the
case of Coventry, the unusual fulness of its city archives, the accounts and records of its
guilds and companies, and the close connection of these with the church supplies us with a
larger body of information than is often at the disposal of the historian of a parish church.
As therefore, in narrating the story of a cathedral some account of the Diocese and its Bishops
has been given, so, before describing the churches of Coventry, we shall give in outline the
history of the city which for 700 years gave its name to a bishop and of the great monastery
whose church was for 400 years his seat.

Though Dugdale says that it is remarkable for antiquity, Coventry as a city has no early history
comparable with that of such places as York, Canterbury, Exeter, or Colchester, while its modern
history is mainly a record of fluctuating trade and the rise and decline of new industries.
But through all its Mediæval period, from the eleventh century down to the Reformation, with
an expiring flicker of energy in the seventeenth, there is no lack of life and colour, and
its story touches every side of the national life, political, religious, and domestic. The
only evidence of extreme antiquity produced by Dugdale is the suffix of its name, for "tre
is British, and signifieth the same that villa in Latin doth;" while the first part may be
derived from the convent or from a supposed ancient name, Cune, for the Sherborne brook.

The first date we have is 1016, when Canute invaded Mercia, burning and laying waste its towns
and settlements, including a house of nuns at Coventry founded by the Virgin St. Osburg in
670, and ruled over by her.[1]

But there is no sure starting-point until the foundation of the monastery by Earl Leofric and
the Countess Godiva, the church being dedicated by Edsi, Archbishop of Canterbury, in honour
of God, the Virgin Mary, St. Peter, St. Osburg, and All Saints on 4th October, 1043. Leofwin,
who was first abbot with twenty-four monks under his rule, ten years after became Bishop of
Lichfield. The original endowment by Leofric, consisted of a half of Coventry[2] with fifteen
lordships in Warwickshire and nine in other counties, making it (says Roger de Hoveden) the
wealthiest monastery of the period. Besides this the pious Godiva gave all the gold and silver
which she had to make crosses, images, and other adornments for the church and its services.
The well-known legend of her ride through Coventry first appears in the pages of Matthew of
Westminster in the early fourteenth century. The Charter of Exemption from Tolls is not in
existence, and the story of Peeping Tom is the embroidery of the prurient age (1678), in which
the pageant was instituted. In a window of Trinity Church figures of Leofric and Godiva were
set up about the time of Richard II, the Earl holding in his right hand a Charter with these
words written thereon:

    I Luriche for the Love of thee
    Doe make Coventre Toll-free.

Abbot Leofwin was succeeded in 1053 by Leofric, nephew of the great earl; and he by a second
Leofwin, who died in 1095. The first Norman bishop of Lichfield had, in compliance with the
decision of a Synod (1075) in London fixing bishops' seats in large towns, removed his to St.
John's, Chester. But his successor, Robert de Lymesey--whose greed appears to have been notable
in a greedy age--having the king's permission to farm the monastic revenues until the appointment
of a new abbot, held it for seven years, and then, in 1102, removed his stool to Coventry.
Five of his successors were bishops of Coventry only, then the style changed to Coventry and
Lichfield, and so remained till 1661, when (in consequence of the disloyalty of Coventry and
the sufferings of Lichfield in the royal cause) the order was reversed!

In 1836 the archdeaconry of Coventry was annexed to Worcester and its name disappeared from
the title, and now it is probable that Coventry will soon again give her name to a See without
dividing the honour. For the joint episcopal history the reader must be referred to the handbook
in this series on Lichfield Cathedral. In this place will only be given that of the Monastery
as such, and specially in connection with its "appropriated" parish churches and the City in
which it stood. That history is not essentially different from that of other monasteries. Though
its connection with the See and the rival claims and antagonisms of the respective Chapters
produced a plentiful crop of serious quarrels, its relations with the townsfolk were free from
such violent episodes as occurred at Bury St. Edmunds or St. Albans. The Chapter of Lichfield
consisted of secular priests (Lymesey and his next successor were married men), while the Monastery,
though freed by pope and king from any episcopal or justiciary power and with the right of
electing its own abbot, was, like all monastic bodies, always jealous of the encroachments
of bishops, and regarded secular priests as inferior in every respect. The opinion of the laity
who saw both sides may be gathered from Chaucer's picture of a "poore Persoun of a toun." He
knew well enough how the revenue, which should have gone to the parish, its parson and its
poor, went to fill the coffers of rich abbeys, to build enormous churches and furnish them
sumptuously, to provide retinues of lazy knights for the train of abbot or bishop, and to prosecute
lawsuits in the papal courts.

But when bishop and abbot were one and the same, the monks still claimed the right of election,
and so for generations the history of the diocese is a tale of strife and bickering, and how
it was that pope, king or archbishop did not perceive that it was a case of hopeless incompatibility
of temper, or, perceiving it, did not dissolve the union or get it dissolved is difficult to
see. Probably the injury done to religion weighed but lightly against vested interests and
the power of the purse. The Monastery was, however, as Dugdale says, "the chief occasion of
all the succeeding wealth and honour that accrued to Coventry"; for though the original Nunnery
may have been planted in an existing settlement, or have attracted one about it, the greater
wealth of the Abbey, its right to hold markets, and all its own varied requirements would quickly
increase and bring prosperity to such a township, as it did at Bury St. Edmunds, Burton-on-Trent
and many another.

In the thirteenth century the priory was in financial straits, through being fined by Henry
III for disobedience. Later, however, he granted further privileges to the monks, among them
that of embodying the merchants in a Gild. In 1340 Edward III granted this privilege to the
City. From an early period the manufacture of cloth and caps and bonnets was the principal
trade of Coventry, and though Leland says, "the town rose by making of cloth and caps, which
now decaying, the glory of the City also decayeth," it was only destroyed by the French wars
of the seventeenth century. But in 1377, when only eighteen towns in the kingdom had more than
3,000 inhabitants, and York, the second city, had only 11,000, Coventry was fourth with 7,000.
Just one hundred years later 3,000 died here of the plague, one of many visitations of that
terrible scourge. At the Suppression it had risen to 15,000, and soon after fell to 3,000,
through loss of trade for "want of such concourse of people that numerously resorted thither
before that fatal Dissolution."

But if the town grew apace so did the Monastery. Thus, when in 1244 Earl Hugh died childless
his sisters divided his estates and Coventry fell to Cecily, wife of Roger de Montalt. Six
years later the Monastery lent him a large sum to take him to the Holy Land, and received from
him the lordship of Coventry (excepting the Manor House and Park of Cheylesmore) and the advowson
of St. Michael's and its dependent chapels, thus becoming the landlords of nearly the whole
of Coventry.

Civic powers grew with the growth of trade. Before 1218 a fair of eight days had been granted
to the Priory, and later another of six days, to be held in the earl's half of the town about
the Feast of Holy Trinity. In 1285 a patent from the king is addressed to the burgesses and
true men to levy tolls for paving the town; one in 1328 for tolls for inclosing the city with
walls and gates, while in 1344 the city was given a corporation, with mayor, bailiffs, a common
seal, and a prison. As the municipal importance and the dignity of the city increased, the
desire for their visible signs strengthened, and so, in 1355, work was begun on the walls,
Newgate (on the London Road) being the first gate to be built. Such undertakings proceeded
slowly, and nine years later the royal permission was obtained to levy a tax for their construction,
"the lands and goods of all ecclesiastical persons excepted."
