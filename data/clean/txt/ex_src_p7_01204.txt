MODEL "S" CARBURETER

Used on Series 691 Nash Sixes

The carbureter measures the fuel charges for the engine and automatically mixes them with the
proper amount of air to form a highly combustible gas. The Marvel Model "S" Carbureter is of
the automatic air valve, heat controlled type. Its outstanding advantages are:

1. Simplicity of construction and operation.

2. Quick starting in any weather.

3. Automatically controlled heat application to ensure complete vaporization of fuels.

4. Economy in fuel consumption.

5. Ease of adjustment to meet varied driving and climatic conditions.

CONSTRUCTION

The construction embodies a main body or mixing chamber and a conventional float chamber bowl
with fuel strainer attached at point of entrance of fuel to bowl. Within the mixing chamber
are two nozzles which proportion the amount of gasoline used in the mixture. One of these nozzles,
called the "low speed," is regulated by the gasoline adjustment screw at bottom of carbureter
and the other, called the "high speed," is controlled by the automatic air valve. An air screw
is provided which regulates the pressure of the air valve spring enclosed therein. Within this
screw is also enclosed a plunger connected by a link to the air valve. The function of this
plunger is to provide a resistance in addition to that of the air valve spring to assist in
acceleration. This arrangement of plunger and air valve screw is termed the dash pot.

A further control of the high speed jet is provided by the fuel metering valve operated by
the carbureter throttle. This valve provides the maximum fuel feed to the "high speed" nozzle
when the throttle is fully opened for high speeds and for quick "pick up." During the ordinary
driving ranges this valve controls the amount of fuel being used, thus providing all the economy
possible. This valve is entirely automatic and requires no adjustment.

The passage-way from the mixing chamber to the intake manifold is controlled by a butterfly
valve which is called the throttle-valve and is connected to the throttle-lever on the steering
wheel as well as to the foot accelerator, its position determining the amount of gas and air
or mixture being fed the engine.

STARTING

A choke button is provided on the instrument board to assist in starting. Pulling out this
button closes a butterfly choker valve (see cut) in the air intake passage of carbureter which
restricts the air opening of the carbureter, and consequently produces a richer mixture.

To start engine, pull out choke button all the way. Advance spark lever about half way and
throttle lever about one-quarter way and depress starter pedal.

As soon as motor fires when starting, this control should be released part way, otherwise too
much fuel will be drawn from carbureter, causing flooding of the motor and failure of the latter
to continue to promptly fire. After starting, motor should be allowed to run "part choke" as
stated for a few minutes while warming up, then the choker control should be fully released,
or pushed in completely on the instrument board, and engine allowed to run normally for sometime
until water in cylinder jackets is thoroughly warmed up before starting to make final carbureter
adjustments.

HEAT CONTROL--STOVE

In the colder seasons warm air is fed to air intake of carbureter through the warm air elbow
"F" (see cut). This elbow connects the carbureter with the warm air stove, which is a casting
surrounding the two exhaust heat tubes which supply exhaust heat to the carbureter jackets
as described below.

The amount of heat required for proper carburation depends on the temperature of the outside
air. The first means of control is in the warm air stove just described, which should be connected
to the carbureter furnishing warm air to carbureter air intake in all seasons of the year when
the outside air temperature is below 50° F., whenever the outside air temperature runs above
this point cold air should be furnished to carbureter air intake. This can be done by loosening
the wing nut holding the warm air elbow "F" on the stove and also loosening the set screw holding
this elbow in the air intake of carbureter, after which slide elbow out of air intake and revolve
it--180 degrees about an horizontal axis and re-insert in carbureter air intake and lock in
place with set screw. The opening in the elbow now is turned down away from the stove and draws
in only cold air.

The above procedure, it must be understood, will vary somewhat due to differences in locality,
altitude and fuels used, but it should be borne in mind that the best economy can be had with
cold air passing to the carbureter, and the stove should not be connected until the acceleration
and performance of the job requires the use of warm air for the best results.

The adjustment of the carbureter should be made per the above description of the stove, as
the latter is used for meeting weather conditions and should be set as described.

HEAT CONTROL--CARBURETER JACKETS

The carbureter and manifolds have been designed to utilize the exhaust gases of the engine
to insure complete vaporization and a consequent minimum consumption of fuel. This is accomplished
by surrounding the upper portion of the mixing chamber with a large heat jacket provided with
an inlet and an outlet opening and connected by means of tubes to an exhaust manifold valve
body in the exhaust pipe of the engine; this valve body, housing a large valve called the main-exhaust-heat-valve
("C" in cut) within the body itself, the return or outlet tube from the carbureter heat jacket
entering the valve-body in the lower portion below the main-exhaust-heat-valve.

The main-exhaust-heat-valve "C" is connected by means of a lever and long connecting rod to
the throttle lever of the carbureter so that when the throttle valve is operated the main-exhaust-valve
is operated simultaneously with it.

The purpose of the carbureter heat jacket and valve in exhaust line with connections described,
is to provide means for utilizing the heat of the exhaust gases of the motor for vaporization
of the fuel supplied the engine by the carbureter and to do so automatically. The automatic
feature of same is accomplished by setting the Main-Exhaust-Heat-Valve "C" by means of the
long connecting rod, in closed position with the closed or idling position of the throttle
valve, thus providing for and causing all of the exhaust gases of the engine to pass through
the heat jacket of the carbureter when engine is idling and to regulate the volume of this
heat as throttle is opened by automatically opening the Main-Exhaust-Heat-Valve, thus allowing
the increasing volume of the exhaust gases to pass on out through the main exhaust pipe without
being deflected and by-passed to the carbureter heat-jacket as the motor speed increases.

By referring to the cut shown (See Page 5) and noting "Heat Setting No. 1," it will be noted
that valve "C" in main exhaust line is fully closed with the closed or idling position of the
throttle valve. This adjustment is accomplished by having long connecting rod "R" from valve
"C" Lever set in "Hole No. 1," in Throttle Lever "L," being sure that when throttle valve is
standing in fully closed or idling position that valve "C" is also in closed position, proving
out the latter feature by loosening connection of valve "C" lever holding long connecting rod;
holding Throttle Lever "L" in closed or idling position and bringing up valve "C" lever on
connecting rod "R" as far as it will go to the right toward the carbureter and tightening its
connection on the connecting rod in that position. After having made the adjustment as just
described, it is assured that "Heat Setting No. 1" has been properly made and that all of the
heat possible from the exhaust has been secured.

This "Heat Setting No. 1," provides as stated, for the most exhaust heat obtainable and should
be used during the entire year, except in extremely hot seasons or hot climates or when high-test
gasoline is being used in engine and even then unless engine is losing power due to excessive heat.

If loss of power or mileage due to too much heat is experienced, first be sure that it is not
due to driving on hot-air instead of cold-air. After making this observation, if there is still
too much heat, refer to cut (See Page 7) describing "Heat Setting No. 2." It will be noted
that connecting rod "R" from valve "C" is removed from "Hole No. 1," in Throttle Lever "L"
and placed in "Hole No. 2," in Throttle Lever. This change is all that is necessary in order
to reduce the amount of heat applied to carbureter. In "Heat Setting No. 2," when the throttle
is in closed or idling position, valve "C" is quite aways off its seat. This adjustment provides
for a great deal less heat than is provided by "Heat Setting No. 1" and is all that is required
in the reduction of the volume of heat together with driving on "Cold" air for the main-air-supply,
in the warmest weather or hottest climates.

NOTE--After original position of valve "C" is made as described in "Heat Setting No. 1" do
not again readjust valve "C" on connecting rod but when changing from "Heat Setting No. 1"
to "Heat Setting No. 2," merely change position of long connecting rod from "Hole No. 1" to
"Hole No. 2" in throttle lever.

ADJUSTMENT

No change should be made in the carbureter adjustments until after an inspection has been made
to determine if the trouble is in some other unit. It should be noted that the gasoline lines
are clear, that there is gasoline in the vacuum tank, that there are no leaks at connections
between carbureter and engine, that the ignition system is in proper condition, and that there
is even compression in all cylinders.

If it is necessary to test adjustment or to make a readjustment proceed as follows:

Set air screw so that the end is flush with the end of ratchet set spring. Loosen packing nut
on needle adjustment. Turn gasoline adjustment to the right very carefully so as not to injure
the needle point, until the valve is closed gently against its seat. Then turn to left approximately
one complete turn which will bring notch in the disc handle directly below the guide post above
it. Tighten packing nut to hold needle firmly as set.

The notch in disc handle of needle is put in handle after the needle has been carefully calibrated
by a flow-meter at the factory, therefore the notch in handle should register with guide post
above it. This setting of needle valve is absolutely essential to get the best results. The
object in directing that needle be first turned to the right until closed is to insure against
two or more turns open, as from closed position to notch (usually about one turn) is the normal
setting. This being true it is not necessary to turn needle in to the right firmly but merely
far enough to be sure that when turning back to the left, to the notch registering with guide
post, that the needle is not more than once around or one turn from its seat.

Set stove heat and damper heat as previously instructed above. Pull out choker to closed position
and start engine in usual manner. As soon as engine has fired release choker three-fourths
of way in. Run until engine has warmed up then push choker all the way in, remembering to never
use choker longer than necessary, as when not needed it has a tendency to foul up engine and
ruin the lubricating oil in the crank case.

Next, set air screw for good idle by either turning to the right a little or backing out to
the left as the needs of the engine require, remembering that first of all, the needle must
be set as described. With the needle so set and the engine warmed up, the adjustment of the
air screw for proper idling is easily accomplished by using a little care. If the air screw
is turned in too tight, the motor will roll. If the air screw is not tight enough, the motor
will hesitate and perhaps stop entirely. To make a nice clean adjustment for idle, first having
set needle as described, turn air screw in quarter of a turn at a time until engine, does roll;
then turn back to the left until engine hesitates, indicating that mixture has too much air
and is too lean; next turn air screw in to the right three or four notches at a time until
engine runs smoothly. This accomplished (and it is very easy to do by proceeding as directed
above) the proper adjustment for the entire range of the engine will have been attained, thus
insuring the best economy and power.

MODEL "S" MARVEL CARBURETER

If the engine idles too fast with throttle closed, the latter may be adjusted by means of the
throttle lever adjusting screw.

RICH MIXTURE

An over-rich mixture will cause the engine speed to fluctuate through more or less regular
periods from high to low speeds; the engine will seem to be mis-firing and there will be noticeable
a strong odor, as well as, usually, a heavy black smoke from the exhaust.

LEAN MIXTURE

The best adjustment is obtained with the fuel and air valves set as described. It must be remembered
that too lean a mixture as well as an over rich mixture causes over-heating and loss of power
and is not as economical as an adjustment which provides just the proper proportion of gasoline
and air.

CAUTION

It must be remembered that the low speed needle has been carefully calibrated to notch in disc
handle and guide post above it, at the factory and that in making an adjustment that the needle
must be so set and the rest of the adjusting done with the air screw as described, never varying
from described needle setting unless in extreme cold weather, when a little more gas may be
carried, or turning off a little when casing head gas is used in hot weather.
