FOOTNOTES:

[Footnote 1: Arnolfo had proposed to raise the cupola immediately above the first cornice,
from the model of the church in the chapel of the Spaniards, where the cupola is extremely
small. Arnolfo was followed by Giotto in 1331. To Giotto succeeded Taddeo Gaddi, after whom,
first Andrea Orgagna, next Lorenzo di Filippo, and lastly Brunelleschi were architects of the
Cathedral.]

[Footnote 2: The story of Columbus and the Egg is familiar to every one. The jest undoubtedly
originated with Brunelleschi, as it is attested by many of the Italian writers; it happened
in 1420, fourteen years before Columbus was born. Toscanelli was a great admirer of Brunelleschi,
whose knowledge of the Scriptures and powers of argument were so great, that he could successfully
dispute in public assemblies, or in private with the most learned theologians, so that Toscanelli
was accustomed to say that "to hear Filippo in argument, one might fancy one's self listening
to a second Paul." So capital a retort could hardly have failed to reach Columbus, through
his instructor, nor would he have hesitated to use it against his antagonists under similar
circumstances. Brunelleschi was born in 1377 and died in 1444; Columbus in 1436, and died in 1506.]

[Footnote 3: Vasari means that Lorenzo continued to receive his salary till 1426, although
Filippo had been appointed sole master of the works in 1423, as he himself relates in the sequel.]

[Footnote 4: How different was the treatment Ghiberti received from Brunelleschi, when the
artists presented their models for one of the bronze doors of the Baptistery of San Giovanni
at Florence. The designs of Ghiberti, Brunelleschi, and Donatello, were considered the three
best; but the two latter, considering that Ghiberti was fairly entitled to the prize, withdrew
their claims in his favor, and persuaded the syndics to adjudge the work to him. Brunelleschi
was requested to undertake the work in concert with Ghiberti, but he would not consent to this,
desiring to be first in some other art or undertaking than equal, or perhaps secondary, in
another. "Now, this was in truth," says Vasari, "the sincere rectitude of friendship; it was
talent without envy, and uprightness of judgment in a decision respecting themselves, by which
these artists were more highly honored than they could have been by conducting the work to
the utmost summit of perfection. Happy spirits! who, while aiding each other took pleasure
in commending the labors of their competitors. How unhappy, on the contrary, are the artists
of our day, laboring to injure each other, yet still unsatisfied, they burst with envy, while
seeking to wound others."]

[Footnote 5: This distrust seems astonishing, after what Brunelleschi had accomplished, but
it shows the opposition and enmity he had to encounter. In 1434, he received a mortifying affront
from the Guild of Builders. Finding that he carried on the building without thinking to pay
the annual tax due from every artist who exercised his calling, they caused him to be apprehended
and thrown into prison. As soon as this outrage was known to the wardens, they instantly assembled
with indignation, and issued a solemn decree, commanding that Filippo should be liberated,
and that the Consuls of the Guild should be imprisoned, which was accordingly done. Baldinucci
discovered and printed the authentic document containing the decree, which is dated August
20, 1434.]

[Footnote 6: Masselli says that the Tuscan braccio, is the ancient Roman foot doubled for greater
convenience, and is equal to one foot nine inches and six lines, Paris measure. The editors
of the Florentine edition of Vasari, 1846-9, remark that the measure of the whole edifice as
given by Vasari, differs from that given by Fantozzi; the latter gives 196 braccia as its total
height. Milizia says, "Brunelleschi completed his undertaking, which surpassed in height any
work of the ancients. The lantern alone remained imperfect; but he left a model for it, and
always recommended, even in his last moments, that it should be built of heavy marble, because
the cupola being raised on four arches, it would have a tendency to spring upwards if not pressed
with a heavy weight. The three mathematicians who have written on the cupola of St. Peter's,
have clearly demonstrated a truth differing from the opinion of Brunelleschi, viz., that the
small cupola increases, in a great degree, the lateral pressure. The whole height of the structure
from the ground to the top, is 385 feet; that is, to the lantern 293 feet, the latter being
68 feet 6 inches; the ball 8 feet; the cross 15 feet 6 inches. *  *  *

"The plan of the dome is octangular; each side in the interior is 57 feet, and the clear width
between the sides, not measuring into the angles, is 137 feet; the walls are 16 feet 9 inches
thick; the whole length of the church is 500 feet. The nave has four pointed arches on each
side, on piers, separating it from the side aisles. The transept and choir have no side aisles,
but are portions of an octagon, attached to the base of the dome, giving the whole plan the
figure of a cross. The edifice has a Gothic character, and is incrusted in marble and mosaic
work." *  *  *

According to Fontani, this cupola exceeds that of the Vatican, both in height and circumference
by four braccia; and although supported by eight ribs only, which renders it much lighter than
that of the Vatican, which has sixteen flanking buttresses, it is nevertheless more solid and
firm. Thus it has never required to be supported by circling hoops of iron, nor has it demanded
the labors of the many engineers and architects who have printed volumes upon the subject.
The construction of this cupola is remarkable in these particulars--that it is octangular,
that it is double, and built entirely on the walls, unsupported by piers, and that there are
no apparent counterforts.]
