  THE PERUSAL OF HIS WORKS ON
  THE SUBJECT

PREFACE

In the course of my experience as an occasional lecturer during the past twelve years, I have
been much impressed by the keen interest evinced, even by the most unlettered persons, when
astronomical subjects are dealt with in plain untechnical language which they can really grasp
and understand.

The pertinent questions which have been addressed to me privately by members of my audiences
have clearly indicated that there is ample scope for writers in satisfying a widespread desire
for fuller and clearer information upon such subjects. I have observed that particular interest
is taken in the planet Mars and also in the moon, but ordinary persons usually find astronomical
text-books too technical and too difficult to master; whilst, as regards Mars, the information
they contain is generally meagre and sometimes not up-to-date.

Scientific readers are already provided for: and it occurred to me that it would be much more
useful and appeal to a more numerous class if, instead of writing a book on the usual lines,
I wrote a narrative of events which might be supposed to occur in the course of an actual voyage
to Mars; and describing what might be seen on the planet during a short visit.

This is the genesis of the story; and, in carrying out my programme, I have endeavoured to
convey by means of natural incidents and conversations between the characters portrayed, the
most recent and reliable scientific information respecting the moon and Mars; together with
other astronomical information: stating it in an interesting form, and in concise, clear, and
understandable language.

Every endeavour has been made to ensure that this scientific information shall be thoroughly
accurate, so that in this respect the book may be referred to with as much confidence as any
ordinary textbook.

Apart from my own studies and work, all these facts have been carefully verified by reference,
as regards the moon, to the works of such well-known authorities as Neison, Elger, Proctor,
Sir Robert Ball, &c., whilst, with respect to Mars, the works of Professor Lowell, Flammarion,
Professor Langley, and other writers, as well as practical papers by other actual observers
of the planet, have been studied.

The personal opinions expressed are entirely my own, and the technical writers above mentioned
are in no way responsible for them. I do not, however, expect my readers to accept all my views,
as they relate to matters in which there is ample room for differences of opinion.

The reader will, of course, understand that whilst the astronomical information is, in all
cases, scientific fact according to our present knowledge, the story itself--as well as the
attempt to describe the physical and social conditions on Mars--is purely imaginative. It is
not, however, merely random imagining. In a narrative such as this some matters--as, for instance,
the "air-ship," and the possibility of a voyage through space--must be taken for granted; but
the other ideas are mainly logical deductions from known facts and scientific data, or legitimate
inferences.

Many years' careful study of the various theories which have been evolved has convinced me
that the weight of evidence is in favour of Professor Lowell's conceptions, as being not only
the most reasonable but the most scientific; and that they fit the observed facts with a completeness
attaching to no other theory. These conceptions I have endeavoured to present fully and clearly;
together with my own views as an entirely independent writer.

In dealing with the conditions on a distant and inaccessible world the farthest flight of imagination
might fall short of the reality, but I have preferred to treat these matters somewhat restrainedly.
Whilst no one can say positively that the intelligent inhabitants of Mars do not possess bodies
resembling our own, it is very probable that they differ from us entirely; and may possess
forms which would appear to us strange and weird. I have, however, thought it desirable to
endow the Martians with bodies resembling ours, but glorified in form and features. The powers
ascribed to the Martians are really only extensions of powers which some amongst us claim to
possess, and they fall short of what more than one modern scientific writer has predicated
as being within the possibilities of science at a not very distant future.

During the past few years I have been greatly indebted to Professor Lowell for his kindness
and ready courtesy in furnishing me with information on obscure matters connected with Mars;
and my thanks are also due to the Rev. Theodore E.R. Phillips, of Ashstead, who was good enough
to read the manuscript of this book, and whose great observational experience enabled him to
make valuable suggestions in regard to the scientific matters dealt with therein.

Truly "a labour of love," this little book--which Professor Lowell has most kindly permitted
me to dedicate to him--is now submitted to the public, in the sincere hope that its perusal
may serve not only to while away a leisure hour, but tend to nurture a love of the sublime
science of astronomy, and at the same time provide some food for thought.

A few maps, plates, and charts have been added to give completeness to the work, and it is
hoped that they will aid the reader in understanding the several matters dealt with.

NOTES ON THE MAPS AND CHARTS

The maps included in this work have been photographed from a globe of Mars specially made for
the purpose from various charts. In all the maps the south is at the top and the north at the
bottom; and the series shows the general surface configuration all round the planet, together
with the principal canal lines which have been observed; but many other canal lines exist,
especially on the dark areas near the south pole. These lines are usually straight and uniform
in width throughout their whole length: indeed it is difficult to mark them upon a globe so
that they shall appear as regular and uniform as they are actually seen on the planet.

The names on the maps are those now generally accepted and used by astronomers.

The "Greenwich" of Mars, i.e. the point on the Meridian from which astronomers reckon the Martian
longitudes, is indicated by the apex of the small triangular light area just above the equator
in Map I. It is marked on the map as "Fastigium Aryn," and is chosen as longitude "0," because
from its general outline it cannot be mistaken by observers.

"Sirapion," the supposed landing-place of the travellers mentioned in the story, is shown on
Map III., just above the central and lowest point of the dark area at the top of the map. This
name will not be found upon any other map of Mars. From it the reader will gain a clear idea
of the shape of the two orbits and how they are placed with regard to each other.

It also shows the course supposed to be taken by the air-ship on its outward and homeward journeys,
and the point reached when one of the travellers desired to turn back; together with the alternative
routes which were then discussed.

This chart, and the other one showing the positions of the two planets at different oppositions
of Mars, will enable the reader to understand how it is that Mars approaches so much nearer
to the earth at some oppositions than it does at others. The positions of the oppositions from
1916 to 1922 are only approximations, as no exact data are yet available. The earth is closest
to the orbit of Mars about the 27th of August each year, and if Mars comes into opposition
about that date it is then only about thirty-five million miles away. If, however, the opposition
occurs near the 22nd February, the earth is then at its greatest possible distance from the
orbit of Mars, and that planet will then be over sixty million miles away: appearing very much
smaller than when at its most favourable point of approach.

On the 18th of September, 1909, Mars was only slightly over thirty-six million miles from the
earth, and it will be fifteen years before such a favourable situation again occurs.

The nearest point of approach does not necessarily occur on the actual date of the opposition.
In 1907 Mars was in perigee, as it is termed, seven days after the opposition; while in 1909,
perigee was before opposition.

The diagram showing the positions and movements of the planets during the period covered by
the outward voyage of the Areonal is sufficiently explained by the notes printed thereon. It
may, however, be pointed out that though the orbits of the planets are all elliptical, especially
those of Mercury and Mars, they are so nearly true circles that, when reduced to the scale
of these diagrams, they practically become circles. The exaggerated ellipses so often found
in astronomical books are very misleading. The orbits of Mercury and Mars have an appearance
of ellipticity because the sun does not occupy the central point in the diagram.

The view of the moon is photographed from a large coloured drawing by the author, which occupied
many months in preparation and execution. It shows all the principal formations seen through
the telescope as the moon passes through its various phases, but it must be understood that
the formations can never all be seen at one view as shown in this picture. As the sun rises
on any particular formation the details are gradually revealed by the long shadows cast by
the more elevated portions when the sun is low down in the lunar sky. As the sun rises higher
and higher the shadows grow shorter and shorter, and when the sun is vertically over the formation
the shadows entirely disappear; all details are thus rendered invisible.
