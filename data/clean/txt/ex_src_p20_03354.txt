A great writer of the past generation,[109] who in some respects has done full justice to his
genius and political virtue, has, however (partly, it can hardly be doubted, from regarding
himself as a follower of his great rival, Fox), contrasted his capacity as a War-minister with
that of his father, drawing a comparison on this point very disadvantageous to the son. We
need not stop to examine how far the praises which he bestows on Lord Chatham's talents as
a planner of military operations are deserved; but it may very fairly be contended that the
disparaging views of Pitt's military policy which he has advanced are founded solely on what
is in this as well as in many other instances a most delusive criterion, success. It is true,
unquestionably, that in the campaigns of 1793-4-5 against the French revolutionists, while
he took upon this country the entire burden of the naval war, on land he contented himself
with playing a secondary part, and employing a comparatively small force (which, however, doubled
that which his father had sent to Minden),[110] for the success of the military operations
trusting chiefly to the far stronger Austrian and Prussian divisions, under the command of
Prince Coburg and the Duke of Brunswick, to which the British regiments were but auxiliaries.
It is true, also, that the result of their operations was unfortunate, and that the German
generals proved wholly unable to contend with the fiery and more skilful impetuosity of Jourdan
and Pichégru. But the question is not whether Pitt's confidence in the prowess of his allies
was misplaced, but whether he had not abundant reason to justify him in entertaining it. And,
to judge fairly on this point, we must recollect the reputation which for the last forty years
the Austrian and Prussian armies had enjoyed. The result of the seven years' war had established
the renown of the Prussians, and the Duke of Brunswick was understood to be a favorite pupil
of the Great Frederic. The same war had shown that the Austrians were not very unequal to the
Prussians; while the reputation of the French troops had fallen to the lowest ebb, the most
memorable event in their annals during the same war being the rout of Rosbach, when 60,000
of them fled before Frederic and 22,000. At the breaking out of the Revolution, it might be
said that De Bouille was the only French general of the slightest reputation, and since the
sad journey to Varennes he had been an exile from his country. And, though again in 1803 Pitt
once more trusted for success on land to Continental alliances, not only does he deserve admiration
for the diplomatic talent with which he united Austria, Prussia, and Russia against France,
but it can hardly be doubted that confederacy would have been triumphant, had not the incompetent
vanity of Alexander ruined all its prospects by his rash disregard at Austerlitz of the experienced
warnings of his own staff.[111]

The new form of government which he established for India, and to which allusion has been made,
has lost the greater part of its importance in the eyes of the present generation, from the
more-recent abolition of the political authority of the East India Company, though of some
of the principles which he avowed he had taken for his guides it is worth while to preserve
the record; with such clearness, as well as statesman-like wisdom, do they affirm the objects
which every one should keep in view who applies himself to legislation for distant dependencies
where the privileges and interests of foreign fellow-subjects are to be regarded with as jealous
a solicitude as those of our own countrymen. These objects may be briefly described as being
the reconciling the vested and chartered interests of the Company with the legitimate authority
of the King's government; for, though Pitt admitted that "state necessity" might occasionally
be allowed as a valid reason for the abrogation of a charter, he affirmed that nothing short
of such absolute necessity could excuse such a measure, and he relied on the previous history
of the Company to prove the fallacy of an observation that had sometimes been made, that commercial
companies could not govern empires. There were three interests to be considered: that of the
native Indians, that of the Company, and that of this country; and the problem to be solved
was, "how to do the most good to India and to the East India Company with the least injury
to our constitution." Some of his remarks contained unavoidable allusions to Fox's bill of
the previous year, since some of the provisions of his bill were entirely opposite to those
which Fox had framed, the most material point of difference being the character of the Board
of Control which he proposed to establish. Fox, as has been seen, had proposed to make the
commissioners to be appointed under his bill irremovable for several years, whatever changes
might take place in the home government; an arrangement which the opposers of the bill suspected
of being designed to prevent any change in the home government from taking place. Pitt, on
the other hand, laid down as one of his leading principles that "the board could not be permanent,
that it must be subordinate to the administration of the day, and that permanency would be
in itself a deviation from the principles of the constitution, and would involve the board
in contradictions to the executive government that could not fail to be attended with great
public inconvenience. An institution to control the government of India must be either totally
independent of the government of this country or subordinate to it." "The board was to consist
of none but privy councillors," and instead of the vast amount of patronage which was to have
been created by the bill of 1783, this board was "to create no increase of officers nor to
impose any new burdens." ... "The first and leading ideas would be, to limit the subsisting
patronage;" ... and so little was Pitt covetous to engross that which did and must continue
to subsist, that he left even "the officers of the government of Bengal to the nomination of
the Court of Directors, subject only to the negative of the crown; and the Court of Directors
was also to have the nomination of the officers of all the subordinate governments, except
only of the commander-in-chief, who, for various reasons, must remain to be appointed by the
crown." Another very important part of the arrangement was, that "gradation and succession
were to be the general rule of promotion," a regulation which of itself would be "a forcible
check upon patronage, and tend greatly to its reduction." The governor of Bengal was to be
the governor-general of the whole country, the governors of Madras and Bombay being subordinate
to him; and each governor was to be assisted by a council of three members, of whom the commander
of the forces was to be one.

The spirit in which a law or a government is administered is commonly of greater practical
importance than the words in which the regulation or the system is framed or defined; and Pitt,
therefore, concluded his speech by laying down a few "clear and simple principles as those
from which alone a good government could arise. The first and principal object would be to
take care to prevent the government from being ambitious and bent on conquest. Commerce was
our object, and, with a view to its extension, a pacific system should prevail, and a system
of defence and conciliation. The government there ought, therefore, in an especial manner,
to avoid wars, or entering into alliances likely to create wars." It was not to forget "to
pay a due regard to self-defence, or to guard against sudden hostilities from neighboring powers,
and, whenever there was reason to apprehend attack, to be in a state of preparation. This was
indispensably necessary; but whenever such circumstances occurred, the executive government
in India was not to content itself with acting there as the circumstances of the case might
require; it was also to send immediate advice home of what had happened, of what measures had
been taken in consequence, and what farther measures were intended to be pursued; and a tribunal
was to be established to take cognizance of such matters." The system of taking presents from
the natives was to be absolutely prohibited, a regulation which he hoped would "tend effectually
to check private corruption;" and, lastly, it was proposed to establish a court of criminal
judicature for the trial in England of certain classes of delinquents after their return from
India. The Judges of the court were to be men of the highest character; they were to be chosen
by ballot, some being taken from the bench of judges, some from each House of Parliament. And
they were "not to be tied down to strict rules of evidence, but to be upon their oaths to give
their judgments conscientiously, and to pronounce such judgment as the common law would warrant."
Such a tribunal he admitted to be an innovation; but, "unless some new process were instituted,
offences shocking to humanity, opposite to justice, and contrary to every principle of religion
and morality, must continue to prevail, unchecked, uncontrolled, and unrestrained, and the
necessity of the case outweighed the risk and the hazard of the innovation."

These were the general outlines of the constitution which in 1784 the Parliament established
for India, and the skill with which it was adapted to the very peculiar character of the settlements
to be governed is sufficiently proved by the fact that it was maintained with very little alteration
equally by Whig and Tory administrations for three-quarters of a century, till the great convulsion
of the Mutiny compelled an entire alteration in the system, and the abolition of the governing
powers of the Company, as we shall have occasion to relate in a subsequent chapter. The principles
which Pitt had laid down as the guiding maxims for the governors; the avoidance of ambitious
views of conquest, the preservation of peace, and the limitation of the aims of the government
to the encouragement and extension of commerce, were not equally adhered to. Undoubtedly, in
some instances, the wars in which, even during Pitt's too short lifetime, the Indian government
was engaged, came under his description of wars which were justifiable on the ground of self-defence--wars
undertaken for the preservation of what had been previously won or purchased, rather than for
the acquisition of new territories at the expense of chiefs who had given us no provocation.
But for others, though professedly undertaken with a view only of anticipating hostile intentions,
the development of which might possibly be reserved for a distant future, it is not easy to
find a similar justification; and it may be feared that in more than one case governors-general,
conscious of great abilities, have been too much inclined to adopt the pernicious maxim of
Louis XIV., that the aggrandizement and extension of his dominions is the noblest object which
a ruler of nations can have in view. Yet, though unable on strictly moral grounds to justify
all the warlike enterprises which make up so large a part of our subsequent Indian history,
it is impossible, probably, for even the most rigid moralist to avoid some feelings of national
pride in the genius of our countrymen, who in the short space of a single century have built
up an empire of a magnitude unequalled even by the Caesars, and have governed and still are
governing it in so wise and beneficent a spirit, and with such a display of administrative
capacity, that our rule is recognized as a blessing by the great majority of the nations themselves,
as a protection from ceaseless intestine war, from rapine, and that worst of tyrannies, anarchy,
which was their normal condition before Clive established our supremacy at Plassy, and into
which they would surely and speedily fall back, if our controlling authority were to be withdrawn.

India was not the only British settlement for which the growth of our empire compelled Pitt
to devise a constitution. The year which saw his birth had also seen the conquest of Canada
from the French; and in 1774 a system of government for the new province had been established
which it is sufficient here to describe as one, which differed but little from a pure despotism,
the administration being vested in a governor and Legislative Council, every member of which
was to be nominated by the crown. But the working of this act had from the first proved very
unsatisfactory, and had become more so as the population increased by the influx of fresh settlers
from Great Britain, and also from the United States, here many of those who in the recent civil
war had adhered the connection with the mother country had been exposed to constant malice
and ill-treatment, and had preferred crossing the border and obtaining lands in Canada to returning
to England. Pitt recognized the evil, and undertook to remedy it and in 1791 he introduced
a bill to establish a constitution for Canada, which a recent historian describes as "remarkable,
as recognizing for the first time the wise and generous principle of independent colonial institutions,
which has since been fully developed in every dependency of the British crown capable of local
self-government."[112] One peculiar difficulty in framing such a constitution arose from the
circumstance of the old French colonists, who greatly outnumbered the settlers of British blood,
being attached to the Roman Catholic religion; while the British settlers were nearly, or perhaps
all, Protestant, though of different denominations. The difficulty was, indeed, lessened by
the circumstance that the French dwelt in Quebec and the district between that city and the
mouth of the St. Lawrence, and that the English had for the most part betaken themselves to
the more inland region. And this local separation of the two races the minister now took for
his guide in the arrangement which he devised. The most important feature in it was the division
of the province into two parts, as Upper and Lower Canada, and the establishment of a distinct
local Legislature for each division, a House of Assembly being created in each, and a Council,
so as, in Pitt's words, "to give both divisions the full advantages of the British constitution."
The Assemblies were to have the power of taxation (so that there was no room left for such
perverse legislation by a British Parliament as had lately cost its sovereign the United States).
The act of habeas corpus was extended to the province (a privilege which no one of French blood
had ever enjoyed before); the tenure of land was to be the socage[113] tenure so long and happily
established in England. Complete religious toleration was established, and a certain proportion
of land was allotted in Upper Canada, as a provision for a Protestant clergy, and the foundation
of an ecclesiastical establishment. So great was Pitt's desire to complete the resemblance
between the colony and Great Britain, that he even contemplated the creation of an aristocracy,
by the introduction of a provision enabling the King to grant hereditary colonial titles, the
possession of which should include hereditary seats in the provincial Council. The two latter
clauses were opposed by Fox, and the latter of them, though sanctioned by Parliament, was never
carried out in practice. But Fox, bitter as he was at this time in his general opposition to
the government, agreed cordially in the general principles of the bill, avowing his conviction
that "the only method of retaining distant colonies with advantage is to enable them to govern
themselves," so that each party in the British Parliament is entitled to a share of the credit
for this pattern of all subsequent colonial constitutions--Pitt for the original genius for
organization which his contrivance of all the complicated details of the measure displayed,
and Fox for his frank adoption of the general principle inculcated by his rival, even while
differing as to some of the minor details of the measure. During these years the country was
increasing in prosperity, and the minister was daily rising in credit; more powerful and more
popular than the most successful or the most brilliant of his predecessors. But during these
same years two great constitutional difficulties had arisen, one of which, indeed, the deep
sense which both parties felt of the danger of investigating it shelved almost as soon as it
was seen; but the other of which, besides the importance which it derived from the degree in
which it involved the principle of the supreme authority of Parliament, and brought under discussion
even that which regulates the succession to the crown, imperilled the existence of the ministry,
and threatened a total change in both the domestic and foreign policy of the nation.

The Prince of Wales, who had come of age in the summer of 1783, had at once begun to make himself
notorious for the violence of his opposition to his father's ministers, carrying the openness
of his hostility so far as, during the Westminster election to drive about the streets with
a carriage and all his servants profusely decorated with Fox's colors; and, still more discreditably,
by most unmeasured profligacy of all kinds. The consequence was that he soon became deeply
involved in debt, so deeply that, in 1787, a member of Fox's party gave notice of his intention
to move that the Parliament should pay his debts and increase his income. Pitt, without specifying
his reasons, avowed that he should feel it his duty to oppose any grant of such a character;
but another member of Parliament, Mr. Rolle, one of the members for Devonshire, being trammelled
by no such feeling of responsibility, expressed a similar resolution in language which contained
an allusion perfectly understood on both sides of the House. He said that "the question thus
proposed to be brought forward went immediately to affect our constitution in Church and State."
And every one knew that he was referring to a report which had recently become general, that
the Prince was married to a Roman Catholic lady of the name of Fitzherbert. No direct notice
was taken of this allusion at the moment, Fox himself, who had the chief share of the Prince's
confidence, being accidentally absent; but a day or two afterward he referred to Rolle's speech
with great indignation, declaring that it referred to a "low, malicious calumny" which had
no foundation whatever, and "was only fit to impose on the lowest order of persons." Being
pressed as to the precise force of his assertion, and being asked whether it meant more than
that under the existing laws, such as the Royal Marriage Act, there had been no marriage, because
there could have been no legal marriage, he declared that he meant no such evasion, but that
no marriage ceremony, legal or illegal, had ever taken place; and farther, that in saying this
he was speaking on the direct authority of the Prince himself. No more degrading act stains
the annals of British royalty. For the fact was true--the very next evening Fox learned the
deceit which the Prince had practised on him from a gentleman who had been one of the witnesses
to the marriage, which had been solemnized by a Protestant clergyman fifteen months before.[114]
And his indignation was such that for some time afterward he abstained from all interference
in the Prince's affairs; while the language held by the Prince's other confidant, Mr. Sheridan,
was so evasive as to betray a consciousness that whatever had occurred would not bear the light
of day; so that there were very few to whom the truth or falsehood of the report was a subject
of interest who felt any uncertainty on the subject.

It may, probably, be regarded as fortunate for the peace of the kingdom that the Prince, who
eventually became King George IV., left behind him no issue from his marriage with the Princess,
the failure of heirs of his body thus removing any temptation to raise the question whether
he had not himself forfeited all right to succeed to the throne by his previous marriage to
a Roman Catholic. A clause of the Bill of Rights provides that any member of the royal family
who should marry a Roman Catholic (with the exception of the issue of princesses who may be
the wives of foreign princes) shall by that marriage be rendered incapable of inheriting the
crown of England. And though the Royal Marriage Act (which, as we have seen, had been recently
passed) had enacted that no marriage of any member of the royal family contracted without the
consent of the reigning sovereign should be valid, it by no means follows that an invalidity
so created would exempt the contractor of a marriage with a Roman Catholic, which as an honorable
man he must be supposed to have intended to make valid, from the penalties enacted by the Bill
of Rights. It is a point on which the most eminent lawyers of the present day are by no means
agreed. The spirit of the clause in that bill undoubtedly was, that no apparent or presumptive
heirs to the crown should form a matrimonial connection with any one who should own allegiance
to a foreign power, and that spirit was manifestly disregarded if a prince married a Roman
Catholic lady, even though a subsequent law had enacted a conditional invalidity of such a
marriage. We may find an analogy to such a case in instances where a man has abducted a minor,
and induced her to contract a marriage with himself. The lady may not have been reluctant;
but the marriage has been annulled, and the husband has been criminally prosecuted, the nullity
of the marriage not availing to save him from conviction and punishment. A bigamous marriage
is invalid, but the bigamist is punished. And, apart from any purely legal consideration, it
may be thought that public policy forbids such a construction of law as would make the illegality
or invalidity of an act (and all illegal acts must be more or less invalid) such a protection
to the wrong-doer as would screen him from punishment.

Whatever may be the judgment formed on the legal aspect and merits of the case, the conduct
of the Prince could not fail to give the great body of the people, justly jealous at all times
of their national adherence to truthfulness and honesty, a most unfavorable impression of his
character. As has been already mentioned, Fox was so indignant at having been made the instrument
to assure the Parliament and the nation of a falsehood, that he for a time broke off all communication
with him.[115] Yet a singular caprice of fortune, or, it would be more proper to say, a melancholy
visitation of Providence, before the end of the following year led Fox to carry his championship
of the same Prince who had so abused his confidence to the length of pronouncing the most extravagant
eulogies on his principles, and on his right to the confidence and respect of the nation at
large. In the autumn of 1788 the King fell into a state of bad health, which in no long time
affected his mind, and, by the middle of November, had so deranged his faculties as to render
him incapable of attending to his royal duties, or, in fact, transacting any business whatever.
Parliament was not sitting, but its re-assembling had been fixed for the 4th of December, and
before that day arrived the King's illness had assumed so alarming a character, and it appeared
so unsafe to calculate on his immediate recovery, that the minister summoned a Privy Council,
the summons being addressed to the members of the Opposition as well as to his own followers,
to receive the opinions of the physicians in attendance on his Majesty, as a necessary foundation
for the measures which he conceived it to be his duty to propose to Parliament. Those opinions
were, that it was almost certain that the disease would not be permanent, though no one could
undertake to fix its duration with the least appearance of probability. And, as the royal authority
could not be left in abeyance, as it were, for an uncertain period, it was indispensable to
appoint a Regent to conduct the affairs of the kingdom till the King should, happily, be once
more in a condition to resume his functions.

In considering the line of conduct adopted in this emergency by Pitt and his great rival Fox,
Pitt has one manifest advantage on his side, that it is impossible to attribute the course
which he took to any personal motive, or any desire for the retention of official power; while
it is equally impossible to doubt that Fox was in no slight degree,[116] and that Lord Loughborough,
the prince's chief adviser on points of law, was wholly influenced by the hope of supplanting
the ministry. Pitt had never the least doubt that on the establishment of the Regency he should
be dismissed, and was prepared to return to the Bar. But his knowledge of the preference which
the Prince entertained for his rival did not lead him to hesitate for a single moment as to
the propriety of placing him in a situation to exercise that preference. Such a search for
precedents was no novelty, and may be thought to have been especially proper in such a case
as this, since history recorded the appointment of several regencies, one under circumstances
strikingly resembling those now existing, when, in 1454, Henry VI. had fallen into a state
of imbecility, and the Parliament appointed the Duke of York Protector[117] of the kingdom.

But Fox instantly opposed it with extreme vehemence, declaring that the appointment of such
a committee would be a pure waste of time. It was notorious, he affirmed, that no precedent
existed which could have any bearing on the present case, since there was in existence a person
such as had never been found on any previous occasion, an heir-apparent of full age and capacity
to exercise the royal authority; and he declared it to be his deliberate opinion that the Prince
of Wales had "as clear and express a right to assume the reins of government, and to exercise
all the powers of sovereignty, during the illness and incapacity of the sovereign, as if that
sovereign were actually deceased." Such an assertion of indefeasible right was so totally at
variance with the Whig doctrines which Pitt, equally with Fox, regarded as the true principles
of the constitution, that Pitt at once perceived the advantage which it gave him, by enabling
him to stand forward as the supporter of the supreme authority of Parliament, which Fox had
by implication denied. He instantly replied that to assert an inherent indefeasible right in
the Prince of Wales, or any one else, independently of the decision of the two Houses, fell
little short of treason to the constitution; but, at the same time, to prevent any one pretending
to misconceive his intentions, he allowed it to be seen with sufficient plainness that, when
once the right of Parliament to appoint the Regent had been established, he should agree in
the propriety of conferring that office on the Prince of Wales. The committee was appointed;
but, even before it could report the result of its investigations, the doctrine advanced by
Fox had been the subject of discussion in the House of Lords, where Lord Camden, who had presided
over the meeting of the Privy Council a few days before, on moving for the appointment of a
similar committee of peers, had taken occasion to declare that, if Fox had made such an assertion
as rumor imputed to him, it was one which had no foundation in "the common law of the kingdom."
He had never read nor heard of such a doctrine. Its assertors might raise expectations not
easily laid, and might involve the country in confusion. And he contended, as Pitt had done
in the Commons, that its assertion was a strong argument in favor of the appointment of a committee,
that it might be at once seen whether it were warranted by any precedent whatever. The reports
of the two committees bore out Fox's statement, that no precedent entirely applicable to the
case before them had ever occurred. But by this time Fox had learned that the argument which
he had founded on it was in the highest degree unpalatable both to Parliament and to the nation;
and for a moment he sought to modify it by an explanation that, though he had claimed for the
Prince "the naked right, he had not by that expression intended to maintain that that right
could be reduced into possession without the consent of Parliament;" an explanation not very
reconcilable to common sense, since, if a right were inherent and indefeasible, Parliament
could not, without absolute tyranny, refuse to sanction its exercise; and, in fact, his coadjutor,
Sheridan, on the very same evening, re-asserted his original doctrine in, if possible, still
more explicit terms, warning the minister "of the danger of provoking the Prince to assert
his right," while a still greater man (Burke) declared that "the minister had taken up an attitude
on the question tantamount to that of setting himself up as a competitor to the Prince." Such
inconsiderate violence gave a great advantage to Pitt, one of whose most useful characteristics
as a debater was a readiness and presence of mind that nothing could discompose. He repelled
such menaces and imputations with an equally lofty scorn, and, after a few necessary preliminaries,
brought forward a series of resolutions, one of which declared the fact of the sovereign's
illness, and consequent incapacity; a second affirmed it to be the right and duty of the two
Houses of Parliament to provide the means for supplying the defect in the royal authority;
and a third imposed on the Houses the task of deciding on the mode in which the royal assent
necessary to give their resolutions the authority of law should be signified. It was impossible
to object to the first; but the second was stubbornly contested by the Opposition, the chiefs
of the Coalition Ministry once more fighting side by side; though Lord North contented himself
with arguing that the affirmation of the right and duty of Parliament was a needless raising
of a disputable point, and moving, therefore, that the committee should report progress, as
the recognized mode of shelving it. Fox, however, carried away by the heat of debate, returned
to the assertion of the doctrine of absolute right, overlooking his subsequent modification
of it, and again gave Pitt the advantage, by condescending to impugn his motives for proposing
the resolution, as being inspired, not by a zeal for the constitution, but by a consciousness
that he did not deserve the confidence of the Prince, and, therefore, anticipated his instant
dismissal by the Regent. The re-affirmation of the Prince's inherent right was, indeed, necessary
to Fox as the foundation for the objections which he took to other parts of Pitt's scheme.
