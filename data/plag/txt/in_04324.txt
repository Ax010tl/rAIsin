The proceedings of the House of Lords resembled that of the Commons; on the 8th of November
they concurred with the resolution of their committee, which was unfavourable to the establishment
of a bank. A protest was, however, entered, signed by four temporal and two spiritual peers,
and when an address to his Majesty, grounded on that resolution, was proposed, a long debate
ensued, which occupied two days. On the 9th December a list of the subscriptions was called
for, and on the 16th they resolved, that if any lord, spiritual or temporal, should attempt
to obtain a charter to erect a bank, "he should be deemed a contemnor of the authority of that
house, and a betrayer of the liberty of his country." They ordered, likewise, that this resolution
should be presented by the chancellor to the lord lieutenant. ("Lord's Journal," vol. ii, pp.
687-720.) Monck Mason's "Hist. St. Patrick's Cathedral," p. 325, note 3. [T. S.]

[27] The title, Esquire, according to a high authority, was anciently applied "to the younger
sons of nobility and their heirs in the immediate line, to the eldest sons of knights and their
heirs, to the esquire of the knights and others of that rank in his Majesty's service, and
to such as had eminent employment in the Commonwealth, and were not knighted, such as judges,
sheriffs, and justices of the peace during their offices, and some others. But now," says Sir
Edward Walker, "in the days of Charles I., the addition is so increased, that he is a very
poor and inconsiderable person who writes himself less."

Accordingly, most of the signatures for shares in the projected National Bank of Ireland, were
dignified with the addition of Esquire, which, added to the obscurity of the subscribers, incurs
the ridicule of our author in the following treatise. [S.]

[28] SUBSCRIBERS TO THE BANK, PLACED ACCORDING TO THEIR ORDER AND QUALITY, WITH NOTES AND QUERIES.

A true and exact account of the nobility, gentry, and traders, of the kingdom of Ireland, who,
upon mature deliberation, are of opinion, that the establishing a bank upon real security,

'The theories of political economy proved to have no application to Ireland.'" The word "controlled"
is used in the now obsolete sense of "confuted." [T. S.]

[38] Sir John Browne, in his "Scheme of the Money Matters of Ireland" (Dublin, 1729), calculated
that the total currency, including paper, was about £914,000, but the author of "Considerations
on Seasonable Remarks" stated that the entire currency could not be more than £600,000. Browne
was no reliable authority; he is the writer to whom Swift wrote a reply. See p. 122. [T. S.]

[40] Lecky refers to a remarkable letter written by an Irish peer in the March of 1702, and
preserved in the "Southwell Correspondence" in the British Museum, in which the writer complains
that the money of the country is almost gone, and the poverty of the towns so great that it
was feared the Court mourning for the death of William would be the final blow. (Lecky, vol.
i., p. 181, 1892 ed.). [T. S.]

[42] This was Dr. Nicholas Barbou, the friend of John Asgill and author of two works on trade
and money. After the Great Fire of London he speculated largely in building, and greatly assisted
in making city improvements. He was the founder of fire insurance in England and was active
in land and bank speculations. He died in 1698, leaving a will directing that none of his debts
should be paid. [T. S.]

[43] The beggars of Ireland are spoken of by Bishop Berkeley. But Arthur Dobbs, in the second
part of his "Essay on Trade," published in 1731, gives a descriptive picture of the gangs who
travelled over Ireland as professional paupers. In the 2,295 parishes, there was in each an
average of at least ten beggars carrying on their trade the whole year round; the total number
of these wandering paupers he puts down at over 34,000. Computing 30,000 of them able to work,
and assuming that each beggar could earn 4d. a day in a working year of 284 days, he calculates
that their idleness is a loss to the nation of £142,000. (Pp. 444-445 of Thom's reprint; Dublin,
1861) [T. S.]

[49] By Acts 18 Charles II c. 2, and 32 Charles II c. 2, enacted in 1665 and 1680, the importation
into England from Ireland of all cattle, sheep, swine, beef, pork, bacon, mutton, cheese and
butter, was absolutely prohibited. The land of Ireland being largely pasture land and England
being the chief and nearest market, these laws practically destroyed the farming industry.
The pernicious acts were passed on complaint from English land proprietors that the competition
from Irish cattle had lowered their rents in England. "In this manner," says Lecky, "the chief
source of Irish prosperity was annihilated at a single blow." [T. S.]

[50] The original Navigation Act treated Ireland on an equal footing with England. The act,
however, was succeeded in 1663 by that of 15 Charles II c. 7, in which it was declared that
no European articles, with few exceptions, could be imported into the colonies unless they
had been loaded in English-built vessels at English ports. Nor could goods be brought from
English colonies except to English ports. By the Acts 22 and 23 of Charles II. c. 26 the exclusion
of Ireland was confirmed, and the Acts 7 and 8 of Will. III. c. 22, passed in 1696, actually
prohibited any goods whatever from being imported to Ireland direct from the English colonies.
These are the reasons for Swift's remark that Ireland's ports were of no more use to Ireland's
people "than a beautiful prospect to a man shut up in a dungeon." [T. S.]

[51] See note on page 137 of vol. vi of this edition. "The Drapier's Letters." [T. S.]

[52] Lecky quotes from the MSS. in the British Museum, from a series of letters written by
Bishop Nicholson, on his journey to Derry, to the Archbishop of Canterbury. The quotation illustrates
the truth of Swift's remark. In the "Intelligencer" Of the condition of the country thirty
years later, the most terrible of pictures is given by Burdy in his "Life of Skelton": "In
1757 a remarkable dearth prevailed in Ireland.... Mr. Skelton went out into the country to
discover the real state of his poor, and travelled from cottage to cottage, over mountains,
rocks, and heath.... In one cabin he found the people eating boiled prushia [a weed with a
yellow flower that grows in cornfields] by itself for their breakfast, and tasted this sorry
food, which seemed nauseous to him. Next morning he gave orders to have prushia gathered and
boiled for his own breakfast, that he might live on the same sort of food with the poor. He
ate this for one or two days; but at last his stomach turning against it, he set off immediately
for Ballyshannon to buy oatmeal for them.... One day, when he was travelling in this manner
through the country, he came to a lonely cottage in the mountains, where he found a poor woman
lying in child-bed with a number of children about her. All she had, in her weak, helpless
condition to keep herself and her children alive, was blood and sorrel boiled up together.
The blood, her husband, who was a herdsman, took from the cattle of others under his care,
for he had none of his own. This was a usual sort of food in that country in times of scarcity,
for they bled the cows for that purpose, and thus the same cow often afforded both milk and
blood.... They were obliged, when the carriers were bringing the meal to Pettigo, to guard
it with their clubs, as the people of the adjacent parishes strove to take it by force, in
which they sometimes succeeded, hunger making them desperate." (Burdy's Life of Skelton. "Works,"
vol. i, pp. lxxx-lxxxii.) [T. S.]

[53] See on this subject the agitation against Wood's halfpence in the volume dealing with
"The Drapier's Letters." [T. S.]

[54] Faulkner and Scott print this word "irony," but the original edition has it as printed
in the text. [T. S.]

[55] The original edition has this as "Island." Scott and the previous editors print it as
in the text. Iceland is, no doubt, referred to. [T. S.]

[56] Bishop Nicholson, quoted by Lecky, speaks of the miserable hovels in which the people
lived, and the almost complete absence of clothing. [T. S.]

[57] Hely Hutchinson, in his "Commercial Restraints of Ireland" (Dublin, 1779; new edit. 1888)
points out that the scheme proposed by the government, and partly executed, by directing a
commission under the great seal for receiving voluntary subscriptions in order to establish
a bank, was a scheme to circulate paper without money. This and Wood's halfpence seem to have
been the nearest approach made at the time for supplying what Swift here calls "the running
cash of the nation." "Then well said, lion-driver!"

"Who is this?" asked the duke.

"A prisoner of Sir Richard's," answered Lord Foxham; "Mistress Alicia Risingham."

"See that she be married to a sure man," said the duke.

"I had thought of my kinsman, Hamley, an it like your grace," returned
Lord Foxham.

"He hath well served the cause."

"It likes me well," said Richard. "Let them be wedded speedily. Say,
fair maid, will you wed?"

"My lord duke," said Alicia, "so as the
man is straight"--And there, in a perfect consternation, the voice
died on her tongue.

"He is straight, my mistress," replied Richard,
calmly. "I am the only crookback of my party; we are else passably
well shapen. Ladies, and you, my lord," he added, with a sudden change
to grave courtesy, "judge me not too churlish if I leave you. [T. S.]

[70] Absentees and place-holders. [T. S.]

[71] The spirit of opposition and enmity to England, declared by the Scottish Act of Security,
according to Swift's view of the relations between the countries, left no alternative but an
union or a war. [S.]

[72] The Act of Union between England and Scotland. [T. S.]

[73] The reference here is to the linen manufactories of Ireland which were being encouraged
by England. [T. S.]

[74] Swift here refers to the sentiment, largely predominant in Scotland, for the return of
the Stuarts. [T. S.]

[75] Alliances with France. [T. S.]

[76] Alluding to the 33rd Henry VIII, providing that the King and his successors should be
kings imperial of both kingdoms, on which the enemies of Irish independence founded their arguments
against it. [S.] Scott cannot be correct in this note. The allusion is surely to the enactments
known as Poyning's Law. See vol. vi., p. 77 (note) of this edition of Swift's works. [T. S.]

[77] Disturbances excited by the Scottish colonists in Ulster. [S.]

[78] The subjugation of Scotland by Cromwell. [S.]

[79] That is to say, to interpret Poyning's law in the spirit in which it was enacted, and
give to Ireland the right to make its own laws. [T. S.]

[80] Free trade and the repeal of the Navigation Act. [T. S.]

[81] Office-holders should not be absentees. [T. S.]

[82] That the land laws of Ireland shall be free from interference by England, and the produce
of the land free to be exported to any place. [T. S.]

[83] The laws prohibiting the importation of live cattle into England, and the restrictions
as to the woollen industry, were the ruin of those who held land for grazing purposes. [T. S.]

[84] The Act of 10 and 11 William III., cap. 10, was the final blow to the woollen industry
of Ireland. It was enacted in 1699, and prohibited the exportation of Irish wool to any other
country. In the fifth letter of Hely Hutchinson's "Commercial Restraints of Ireland" (1779)
will be found a full account of the passing of this Act and its consequences. [T. S.]

Kensington, collated with that given by Deane Swift in vol. viii. of the 4to edition of 1765.

[87] The letter was written in reply to a letter received from Messrs. Truman and Layfield. [T. S.]

[88] Dr. William King, Archbishop of Dublin. [T. S.]

[89] Swift betrays here a lamentable knowledge of the geography of this part of America. Penn,
however, may have known no better. [T. S.]

[90] William Burnet, at this time the Governor of Massachusetts, was the son of Swift's old
enemy, Bishop Burnet. [T. S.]

[91] Burnet quarrelled with the Assembly of Massachusetts and New Hampshire because they would
not allow him a fixed salary. The Assembly attempted to give him instead a fee on ships leaving
Boston, but the English Government refused to allow this. [T. S.]

[92] The original MS. on which this text is based does not contain the passage here given in
brackets. [T. S.]

[93] Swift is here supported by Arthur Dobbs, who in his "Essays on Trade," pt. ii. (1731)
gives as one of the conditions prejudicial to trade, the luxury of living and extravagance
in food, dress, furniture, and equipage by the Irish well-to-do. He describes it "as one of
the principal sources of our national evils." His remedy was a tax on expensive dress, and
rich equipage and furniture. [T. S.]

[94] The text of this tract is based on that given by Deane Swift in the eighth volume of his
edition of Swift's works published in quarto in 1765. [T. S.]

[95] This refers to Whitshed. [T. S.]

[96] The Fourth. See vol. vi. of present edition. [T. S.]

[97] Some ten years after Swift wrote the above, the roads of Ireland were thought to be so
good as to attract Whitefield's attention. Lecky quotes Arthur Young, who found Irish roads
superior to those of England. (Lecky's "Ireland," vol. i., p. 330, 1892 ed.) [T. S.]

[98] Lecky (vol. i., pp. 333-335, 1892 edit.) gives a detailed account of the destruction of
the fine woods in Ireland which occurred during the forty years that followed the Revolution.
The melancholy sight of the denuded land drew the attention of a Parliamentary Commission appointed
to inquire into the matter. The Act of 10 Will. III. 2, c. 12 ordered the planting of a certain
number of trees in every county, "but," remarks Lecky, "it was insufficient to counteract the
destruction which was due to the cupidity or the fears of the new proprietors." [T. S.]

[99] Swift always distinguished between the Irish "barbarians" and the Irish who were in reality
English settlers in Ireland. Swift, for once, is in accord with the desires of the English
Government, who wished to eradicate the Irish language. His friend the Archbishop of Dublin
and his own college, that of Trinity, were in favour of keeping the language alive. (See Lecky's
"Ireland," vol. i., pp. 331-332.) [T. S.]

[102] The text here given is that of Scott read by the "Miscellaneous Pieces" of 1789. The
"Observations" were written, probably, in 1729. [T. S.]

[103] Monck Mason has an elaborate note on this subject ("Hist. of St. Patrick's Cathedral,"
pp. 320-321, ed. 1819), which is well worth reprinting here, since it is an excellent statement
of facts, and is fully borne out by Hely Hutchinson's account in his "Commercial Restraints
of Ireland," to which reference has already been made:

"In the year 1698 a bill was introduced into the English Parliament, grounded upon complaints,
that the woollen manufacture in Ireland prejudiced the staple trade of England; the matter
terminated at last in an address to the King, wherein the commons 'implored his majesty's protection
and favour on this matter, and that he would make it his royal care, and enjoin all those whom
he employed in Ireland, to use their utmost diligence, to hinder the exportation of wool from
Ireland (except it be imported into England), and for the discouraging the woollen manufacture,
and increasing the linen manufacture of Ireland.' Accordingly, on the 16th July, the King wrote
a letter of instructions to the Earl of Galway, in which the following passage appears: 'The
chief thing that must be tried to be prevented, is, that the Irish parliament takes no notice
of what has passed in this here, and that you make effectual laws for the linen manufacture,
and discourage as far as possible the woollen.'--The Earl of Galway and the other justices
convened the parliament on the 27th of September; in their speech, they recommended a bill
for the encouragement of the manufactures of linen and hemp, 'which,' say they, 'will be found
more advantageous to this kingdom than the woollen manufacture, which, being the settled trade
of England from whence all foreign markets are supplied, can never be encouraged here.' The
house of commons so far concurred with the lords justices' sentiments as to say, in their address
of thanks, that they would heartily endeavour to establish the linen manufacture, and to render
the same useful to England, and 'we hope,' they add, 'to find such a temperament, with respect
to the woollen trade here, that the same may not be injurious to England' ('Cont. Rapin's Hist.,'
p. 376). 'And they did,' says Mr. Smith, 'so far come into a temperament in this case, as,
hoping it would be accepted by way of compromise, to lay a high duty of ... upon all their
woollen manufacture exported; under which, had England acquiesced, I am persuaded it would
have been better for the kingdom in general. But the false notion of a possible monopoly, made
the English deaf to all other terms of accommodation; by which means they lost the horse rather
than quit the stable' ('Memoirs of Wool,' vol. ii., p. 30). The duties imposed by the Irish
parliament, at this time, upon the export of manufactured wool, was four shillings on the value
of twenty shillings of the old drapery, and two shillings upon the like value of the new, except
friezes. But this concurrence of the people of Ireland seemed rather to heighten the jealousy
between the two nations, by making the people of England imagine the manufactures of Ireland
were arrived at a dangerous pitch of improvement, since they could be supposed capable of bearing
so extravagant a duty: accordingly, in the next following year, the English parliament passed
an Act (10-11 William III: cap. 10), that no person should export from Ireland wool or woollen
goods, except to England or Wales, under high penalties, such goods to be shipped only from
certain ports in Ireland, and to certain ports in England: But this was not the whole grievance;
the old duties upon the import of those commodities, whether raw or manufactured, into Great
Britain, were left in the same state as before, which amounted nearly to a prohibition; thus
did the English, although they had not themselves any occasion for those commodities, prohibit,
nevertheless, their being sent to any other nation.

"The discouragement of the woollen manufacture of Ireland, affected particularly the English
settlers there, for the linen was entirely in the hands of the Scotch, who were established
in Ulster, and the Irish natives had no share in either. It is stated in a pamphlet, entitled,
'A Discourse concerning Ireland, etc. in answer to the Exon and Barnstaple petitions,' printed
1697-8, that there were then, in the city and suburbs of Dublin, 12,000 English families, and
throughout the nation, 50,000, who were bred to trades connected with the manufacture of wool,
'who could no more get their bread in the linen manufacture, than a London taylor by shoe-making.'

"Mr. Walter Scott says ('Life of Swift,' p. 278) that the Irish woollen manufacture produced
an annual million, but this is not the fact; Mr. Dobbs in his 'Essay on the Trade of Ireland,'
informs us, from the custom-house books, that in the year 1697 (which immediately preceded
the year in which the address above-mentioned was transmitted to the king) the total value
of Irish woollen exports, of all sorts, was only £23,614 9s. 6d., and in 1687, when they were
at the highest, they did not exceed £70,521 14s. 0d. It moreover appears, that the greater
part of these exports were of a sort which did not interfere with the trade of England, £56,415
16s. 0d. was in friezes, and £2,520 18s. 0d. coarse stockings, the rest consisted in serges
and other stuffs of the new drapery, which affected not the trade of England generally, but
only the particular interests of Exeter and its neighbourhood, and a very few other inconsiderable
towns.

"But, whatever injury was intended, little prejudice was done to Ireland, except what followed
immediately after the passing of this Act. It appears from Mr. Dobbs's pamphlet, that, a few
years after, four times the quantity of woollen goods were shipped in each year, clandestinely,
than had ever been exported, legally, before: moreover, the Irish vastly increased their manufactures
for home consumption, and learned to make fine cloth from Spanish wool: it was only to England
itself that any disadvantage redounded; many manufacturers who were unsettled by this measure,
passed over to Germany, Spain, and to Rouen and other parts of France, 'from these beginnings
they have, in many branches, so much improved the woollen manufactures of France, as to vie
with the English in foreign markets.--Upon the whole, those nations may be justly said to have
deprived Britain of millions since that time, instead of the thousands Ireland might possibly
have made.'--What Mr. Dobbs has here asserted, relative to the removal of the manufacturers,
has been confirmed by another tract, 'Letter from a Clothier a Member of Parliament,' printed
in 1731, which informs us that, for some years after, the English seemed to engross all the
woollen trade, 'but this appearance of benefit abated, as the foreign factories, raised on
the ruin of the Irish, acquired strength': he shows too, that the importation of unmanufactured
wool from Ireland to England had been gradually decreasing since that time, which was probably
on account of the increase of the illicit trade to foreign parts, towards the encouragement
of which the duties, or legal transportation, served to act as a bounty of 36 per cent. 'So
true it is, that England can never fall into measures for unreasonably cramping the industry
of the people of Ireland, without doing herself the greatest prejudice.'" (Note g, pp. 320-321).
[T. S.]

[104] The causes for absenteeism are thus noted by Lecky ("Hist. of Ireland," p. 213, vol.
i., ed. 1892): "The very large part of the confiscated land was given to Englishmen who had
property and duties in England, and habitually lived there. Pray for me."

And he wrung him by the hand.
"Sir," said Richard, "I will pray for you, indeed; though how I may
prevail I wot not. But if ye have so long pursued revenge, and find
it now of such a sorry flavour, bethink ye, were it not well to pardon
others? The position of a Protestant landlord,
living in the midst of a degraded population, differing from him in religion and race, had
but little attraction, the political situation of the country closed to an Irish gentleman
nearly every avenue of honourable ambition, and owing to a long series of very evident causes,
the sentiment of public duty was deplorably low. The economical condition was not checked by
any considerable movement in the opposite direction, for after the suppression of the Irish
manufactures but few Englishmen, except those who obtained Irish offices, came to Ireland."

The amount of the rent obtained in Ireland that was spent in England is estimated elsewhere
by Swift to have been at least one-third. In 1729, Prior assessed the amount at £627,000. In
the Supplement to his "List of Absentees," Prior gives eight further "articles" by which money
was "yearly drawn out of the Kingdom." See the "Supplement," pp. 242-245 in Thone's "Collection
of Tracts," Dublin, 1861. [T. S.]

[105] John Erskine, Earl of Mar, has elsewhere been characterized by Swift as "crooked; he
seemed to me to be a gentleman of good sense and good nature." The great rebellion of 1715,
for which Mar was responsible, was stirred up by him in favour of the Pretender, and succeeded
so far as to bring the Chevalier to Scotland. The Duke of Argyll, however, fought his forces,
and though the victory remained undecided, Mar was compelled to seek safety in France. The
rebellion caused so much disturbance in every part of the British Isles that Ireland suffered
greatly from bad trade. [T. S.]

[112] The person here intimated, Joshua, Lord Allen (whom Swift elsewhere satirizes under the
name of Traulus), was born in 1685. He is said to have been a weak and dissipated man; and
some particulars are recorded by tradition concerning his marriage with Miss Du Pass (whose
father was clerk of the secretary of state's office in James the Second's reign, and died in
India in 1699), which do very little honour either to his heart or understanding.

It is reported, that being trepanned into a marriage with this lady, by a stratagem of the
celebrated Lionel, Duke of Dorset, Lord Allen refused, for some time, to acknowledge her as
his wife. But the lady, after living some time in close retirement, caused an advertisement
to be inserted in the papers, stating the death of a brother in the East Indies, by which Miss
Margaret Du Pass had succeeded to a large fortune. Accordingly, she put on mourning, and assumed
an equipage conforming to her supposed change of fortune. Lord Allen's affairs being much deranged,
he became now as anxious to prove the marriage with the wealthy heiress, as he had formerly
been to disown the unportioned damsel; and succeeded, after such opposition as the lady judged
necessary to give colour to the farce. Before the deceit was discovered, Lady Allen, by her
good sense and talents, had obtained such ascendance over her husband, that they ever afterwards
lived in great harmony.
