You may say that few persons have the time, inclination, taste, or money to carry out such
an experiment; that the average farmer must make each year pay, and that the exploiting of
this matter is therefore of interest to a very limited number. Admitting much of this, I still
claim that there is a lesson to every struggling farmer in this narrative. It should teach
the value of brain work on the farm, and the importance of intelligent cultivation; also the
advantages of good seed, good tilth, good specimens of well-bred stock, good food, and good
care. Feed the land liberally, and it will return you much. Permit no waste in space, product,
time, tools, or strength. Do in a small way, if need be, what I have done on a large scale,
and you will quickly commence to get good dividends. I have spent much more money than was
really necessary on the place, and in the ornamentation of Four Oaks. This, however, was part
of the experiment. I asked the land not only to supply immediate necessities, but to minister
to my every want, to gratify the eye, and please the senses by a harmonious fusion of utility
and beauty. I wanted a fine country home and a profitable investment within the same ring fence.

Will you follow me through the search for the land, the purchase, and the tremendous house-cleaning
of the first year? After that we will take up the years as they come, finding something of
special interest attaching naturally to each. I shall have to deal much with figures and statistics,
in a small way, and my pages may look like a school book, but I cannot avoid this, for in these
figures and statistics lies the practical lesson. Theory alone is of no value. Practical application
of the theory is the test. I am not imaginative. I could not write a romance if I tried. My
strength lies in special detail, and I am willing to spend a lot of time in working out a problem.
I do not claim to have spent this time and money without making serious mistakes; I have made
many, and I am willing to admit them, as you will see in the following pages. ¶ how juvenile by the lower

 It lay to the west of a north-and-south road, abutting on this road
for half a mile, while on the south it was bordered for a mile by a gravelled road, and the
west line was an ordinary country road. The lay of the land in general was a gentle slope to
the west and south from a rather high knoll, the highest point of which was in the north half
of the southeast forty. The land stretched away to the west, gradually sloping to its lowest
point, which was about two-thirds of the distance to the western boundary. A straggling brook
at its lowest point was more or less rampant in springtime, though during July and August it
contained but little water.

Westward from the brook the land sloped gradually upward, terminating in a forest of forty
to fifty acres. This forest was in good condition. The trees were mostly varieties of oak and
hickory, with a scattering of wild cherry, a few maples, both hard and soft, and some lindens.
It was much overgrown with underbrush, weeds, and wild flowers. The land was generally good,
especially the lower parts of it. The soil of the higher ground was thin, but it lay on top
of a friable clay which is fertile when properly worked and enriched.

The farm belonged to an unsettled estate, and was much run down, as little had been done to
improve its fertility, and much to deplete it. There were two sets of buildings, including
a house of goodly proportions, a cottage of no particular value, and some dilapidated barns.
The property could be bought at a bargain. It had been held at $100 an acre; but as the estate
was in process of settlement, and there was an urgent desire to force a sale, I finally secured
it for $71 per acre. The two renters on the farm still had six months of occupancy before their
leases expired. They were willing to resign their leases if I would pay a reasonable sum for
the standing crops and their stock and equipments.

The crops comprised about forty acres of corn, fifty acres of oats, and five acres of potatoes.
The stock was composed of two herds of cows (seven in one and nine in the other), eleven spring
calves, about forty hogs, and the usual assortment of domestic fowls. The equipment of the
farm in machinery and tools was meagre to the last degree. I offered the renters $700 and $600,
respectively, for their leasehold and other property. This was more than their value, but I
wanted to take possession at once.

CHAPTER III

THE FIRST VISIT TO THE FARM

It was the 8th of July, 1895, when I contracted for the farm; possession was to be given August
1st. On July 9th, Polly and I boarded an early train for Exeter, intending to make a day of
it in every sense. We wished to go over the property thoroughly, and to decide on a general
outline of treatment. Polly was as enthusiastic over the experiment as I, and she is energetic,
quick to see, and prompt to perform. She was to have the planning of the home grounds--the
house and the gardens; and not only the planning, but also the full control.

A ride of forty-five minutes brought us to Exeter. The service of this railroad, by the way,
is of the best; there is hardly a half-hour in the day when one cannot make the trip either
way, and the fare is moderate: $8.75 for twenty-five rides,--thirty-five cents a ride. We hired
an open carriage and started for the farm. The first half-mile was over a well-kept macadam
road through that part of the village which lies west of the railway. The homes bordering this
street are of fine proportions, and beautifully kept. They are the country places of well-to-do
people who love to get away from the noise and dirt of the city. Some of them have ten or fifteen
acres of ground, but this land is for breathing space and beauty--not for serious cultivation.
Beyond these homes we followed a well-gravelled road leading directly west. This road is bordered
by small farms, most of them given over to dairying interests.

Presently I called Polly's attention to the fact that the few apple trees we saw were healthy
and well grown, though quite independent of the farmer's or the pruner's care. This thrifty
condition of unkept apple orchards delighted me. I intended to make apple-growing a prominent
feature in my experiment, and I reasoned that if these trees did fairly well without cultivation
or care, others would do excellently well with both.

As we approached the second section line and climbed a rather steep hill, we got the first
glimpse of our possession. At the bottom of the western slope of this hill we could see the
crossing of the north-and-south road, which we knew to be the east boundary of our land; while,
stretching straight away before us until lost in the distant wood, lay the well-kept road which
for a good mile was our southern boundary. Descending the hill, we stopped at the crossing
of the roads to take in the outline of the farm from this southeast corner. The north-and-south
road ran level for 150 yards, gradually rose for the next 250, and then continued nearly level
for a mile or more. We saw what Jane Austen calls "a happy fall of land," with a southern exposure,
which included about two-thirds of the southeast forty, and high land beyond for the balance
of this forty and the forty lying north of it. There was an irregular fringe of forest trees
on this southern slope, especially well defined along the eastern border. I saw that Polly
was pleased with the view.

"We must enter the home lot from this level at the foot of the hill," said she, "wind gracefully
through the timber, and come out near those four large trees on the very highest ground. That
will be effective and easily managed, and will give me a chance at landscape gardening, which
I am just aching to try."

"All right," said I, "you shall have a free hand. Let's drive around the boundaries of our
land and behold its magnitude before we make other plans."

We drove westward, my eyes intent upon the fields, the fences, the crops, and everything that
pertained to the place. I had waited so many years for the sense of ownership of land that
I could hardly realize that this was not another dream from which I would soon be awakened
by something real. I noticed that the land was fairly smooth except where it was broken by
half-rotted stumps or out-cropping boulders, that the corn looked well and the oats fair, but
the pasture lands were too well seeded to dock, milkweed, and wild mustard to be attractive,
and the fences were cheap and much broken.

The woodland near the western limit proved to be practically a virgin forest, in which oak
trees predominated. The undergrowth was dense, except near the road; it was chiefly hazel,
white thorn, dogwood, young cherry, and second growth hickory and oak. We turned the corner
and followed the woods for half a mile to where a barbed wire fence separated our forest from
the woodland adjoining it. Coming back to the starting-point we turned north and slowly climbed
the hill to the east of our home lot, silently developing plans. We drove the full half-mile
of our eastern boundary before turning back.

I looked with special interest at the orchard, which was on the northeast forty. I had seen
it on my first visit, but had given it little attention, noting merely that the trees were
well grown. I now counted the rows, and found that there were twelve; the trees in each row
had originally been twenty, and as these trees were about thirty-five feet apart, it was easy
to estimate that six acres had been given to this orchard. The vicissitudes of seventeen years
had not been without effect, and there were irregular gaps in the rows,--here a sick tree,
there a dead one. A careless estimate placed these casualties at fifty-five or sixty, which
I later found was nearly correct. This left 180 trees in fair health; and in spite of the tight
sod which covered their roots and a lamentable lack of pruning, they were well covered with
young fruit. They had been headed high in the old-fashioned way, which made them look more
like forest trees than a modern orchard. They had done well without a husbandman; what could
not others do with one?

The group of farm buildings on the north forty consisted of a one-story cottage containing
six rooms--sitting room, dining room, kitchen, and a bedroom opening off each--with a lean-to
shed in the rear, and some woe-begone barns, sheds, and out-buildings that gave the impression
of not caring how they looked. The second group was better. It was south of the orchard on
the home forty, and quite near the road.

Why does the universal farm-house hang its gable over the public road, without tree or shrub
to cover its boldness? It would look much better, and give greater comfort to its inmates,
if it were more remote. A lawn leading up to a house, even though not beautiful or well kept,
adds dignity and character to a place out of all proportion to its waste or expense. I know
of nothing that would add so much to the beautification of the country-side as a building line
prohibiting houses and barns within a hundred yards of a public road. A staring, glaring farm-house,
flanked by a red barn and a pigsty, all crowding the public road as hard as the path-master
will permit, is incongruous and unsightly. [> into>] Vnto her Iodine-131 answerde end at lady gloryous

 North
and northwest we could see pleasant lands for at least two miles; directly west, our eyes could
not reach beyond our own forest; to the south and southwest, fruitful valleys stretched away
to a range of wooded hills four miles distant; but on the east our view was limited by the
fringe of woods which lay between us and the north-and-south road.

"This is the exact spot for the house," said Polly. "It must face to the south, with a broad
piazza, and the chief entrance must be on the east. The kitchens and fussy things will be out
of sight on the northwest corner; two stories, a high attic with rooms, and covered all over
with yellow-brown shingles." She had it all settled in a minute.

"What will the paper on your bedroom wall be like?" I asked.

"I know perfectly well, but I shan't tell you."

Seating myself on an out-cropping boulder, I began to study the geography of the farm. In imagination
I stripped it of stock, crops, buildings, and fences, and saw it as bald as the palm of my
hand. I recited the table of long measure: Sixteen and a half feet, one rod, perch, or pole;
forty rods, one furlong; eight furlongs, one mile. Eight times 40 is 320; there are 320 rods
in a mile, but how much is 16-1/2. times 320? "Polly, how much is 16-1/2 times 320?"

"Don't bother me now; I'm busy."

(Just as if she could have told in her moment of greatest leisure!) I resorted to paper and
pencil, and learned that there are 5280 feet in each and every mile. My land was, therefore,
5280 feet long and 2640 feet wide. I must split it in some way, by a road or a lane, to make
all parts accessible. If I divided it by two lanes of twenty feet each, I could have on either
side of these lanes lots 650 feet deep, and these would be quite manageable. I found that if
these lots were 660 feet long, they would contain ten acres minus the ten feet used for the
lane. This seemed a real discovery, as it simplified my calculations and relieved me of much
mental effort.

"Polly, I am going to make a map of the place,--lay it out just as I want it."

"You may leave the home forty out of your map; I will look after that," said the lady.

In my pocket I found three envelopes somewhat the worse for wear. This is how one of them looked
when my map was finished.

I am not especially haughty about this map, but it settled a matter which had been chaotic
in my mind. My plan was to make the farm a soiling one; to confine the stock within as limited
a space as was consistent with good health, and to feed cultivated forage and crops. In drawing
my map, the forty which Polly had segregated left the northeast forty standing alone, and I
had to cast about for some good way of treating it. "Make it your feeding ground," said my
good genius, and thus the wrath of Polly was made to glorify my plans.

This feeding lot of forty acres is all high land, naturally drained. It was near the obvious
building line, and it seemed suitable in every way. I drew a line from north to south, cutting
it in the middle. The east twenty I devoted to cows and their belongings; the west twenty was
divided by right lines into lots of five acres each, the southwest one for the hens and the
other three for hogs.

Looking around for Polly to show her my work, I found she had disappeared; but soon I saw her
white gown among the trees. Joining her, I said,--

"I have mapped seven forties; have you finished one?"

"I have not," she said. "Mine is of more importance than all of yours; I will give you a sketch
this evening. This bit of woods is better than I thought. How much of it do you suppose there is?"

"About seven acres, I reckon, by hook and by crook; enough to amuse you and furnish a lot of
wild-flower seed to be floated over the rest of the farm."

"You may plant what seeds you like on the rest of the farm, but I must have wild flowers. Do
you know how long it is since I have had them? Not since I was a girl!"

"That is not very long, Polly. You don't look much more than a girl to-day. You shall have
asters and goldenrod and black-eyed Susans to your heart's content if you will always be as young."

"I believe Time will turn backward for both of us out here, Mr. Headman. But I'm as hungry
as a wolf. Do you think we can get a glass of milk of the 'farm lady'?"

We tried, succeeded, and then started for home. Neither of us had much to say on the return
trip, for our minds were full of unsolved problems. That evening Polly showed me this plat
of the home forty.

CHAPTER IV

THE HIRED MAN

Modern farming is greatly handicapped by the difficulty of getting good help. I need not go
into the causes which have operated to bring about this condition; it exists, and it has to
be met. I cannot hope to solve the problem for others, but I can tell how I solved it for myself.
I determined that the men who worked for me should find in me a considerate friend who would
look after their interests in a reasonable and neighborly fashion. They should be well housed
and well fed, and should have clean beds, clean table linen and an attractively set table,
papers, magazines, and books, and a comfortable room in which to read them. There should be
reasonable work hours and hours for recreation, and abundant bathing facilities; and everything
at Four Oaks should proclaim the dignity of labor.

From the men I expected cleanliness, sobriety, uniform kindness to all animals, cheerful obedience,
industry, and a disposition to save their wages. These demands seemed to me reasonable, and
I made up my mind to adhere to them if I had to try a hundred men.

The best way to get good farm hands who would be happy and contented, I thought, was to go
to the city and find men who had shot their bolts and failed of the mark; men who had come
up from the farm hoping for easier or more ambitious lives, but who had failed to find what
they sought and had experienced the unrest of a hand-to-mouth struggle for a living in a large
city; men who were pining for the country, perhaps without knowing it, and who saw no way to
get back to it. I advertised my wants in a morning paper, and asked my son, who was on vacation,
to interview the applicants. From noon until six o'clock my ante-room was invaded by a motley
procession--delicate boys of fifteen who wanted to go to the country, old men who thought they
could do farm work, clerks and janitors out of employment, typical tramps and hoboes who diffused
very naughty smells, and a few--a very few--who seemed to know what they could do and what
they really wanted.

Jack took the names of five promising men, and asked them to come again the next day. In the
morning I interviewed them, dismissed three, and accepted two on the condition that their references
proved satisfactory. As these men are still at Four Oaks, after seven years of steady employment,
and as I hope they will stay twenty years longer, I feel that the reader should know them.
Much of the smooth sailing at the farm is due to their personal interest, steadiness of purpose,
and cheerful optimism.

William Thompson, forty-six years of age, tall, lean, wiry, had been a farmer all his life.
His wife had died three years before, and a year later, he had lost his farm through an imperfect
title. Understanding machinery and being a fair carpenter, he then came to the city, with $200
in his pocket, joined the Carpenter's Union, and tried to make a living at that trade. Between
dull business, lock-outs, tie-ups, and strikes, he was reduced to fifty cents, and owed three
dollars for room rent. He was in dead earnest when he threw his union card on my table and said:--

"I would rather work for fifty cents a day on a farm than take my chances for six times as
much in the union."

This was the sort of man I wanted: one who had tried other things and was glad of a chance
to return to the land. Thompson said that after he had spent one lonesome year in the city,
he had married a sensible woman of forty, who was now out at service on account of his hard
luck. He also told of a husky son of two-and-twenty who was at work on a farm within fifty
miles of the city. I liked the man from the first, for he seemed direct and earnest. I told
him to eat up the fifty cents he had in his pocket and to see me at noon of the following day.
Meantime I looked up one of his references; and when he came, I engaged him, with the understanding
that his time should begin at once.

The wage agreed upon was $20 a month for the first half-year. If he proved satisfactory, he
was to receive $21 a month for the next six months, and there was to be a raise of $1 a month
for each half-year that he remained with me until his monthly wage should amount to $40,--each
to give or take a month's notice to quit. This seemed fair to both. I would not pay more than
$20 a month to an untried man, but a good man is worth more. As I wanted permanent, steady
help, I proposed to offer a fair bonus to secure it. Other things being equal, the man who
has "gotten the hang" of a farm can do better work and get better results than a stranger.

The transient farm-hand is a delusion and a snare. He has no interest except his wages, and
he is a breeder of discontent. If the hundreds of thousands of able-bodied men who are working
for scant wages in cities, or inanely tramping the country, could see the dignity of the labor
which is directly productive, what a change would come over the face of the country! There
are nearly six million farms in this nation, and four millions of them would be greatly benefited
by the addition of another man to the working force. There is a comfortable living and a minimum
of $180 a year for each of four million men, if they will only seek it and honestly earn it. Whan

My plan involved not only finding, raising, and distributing water, but also the care of waste
water and sewage. Inquiring among those who had deep wells in the village, I found that good
water was usually reached at from 180 to 210 feet. As my well-site was high, I expected to
have to bore deep. I contracted with a well man of good repute for a six-inch well of 250 feet
(or less), piped and finished to the surface, for $2 a foot; any greater depth to be subject
to further agreement.

It took nearly three months to finish the water system, but it has proved wonderfully convenient
and satisfactory. During seven years I have not spent more than $50 for changes and repairs.
We struck bed-rock at 197 feet, drilled 27 feet into this rock, and found water which rose
to within 50 feet of the surface and which could not be materially lowered by the constant
use of a three-inch power-pump. The water was milky white for three days, in spite of much
pumping; and then, and ever after, it ran clear and sweet, with a temperature of 54° F. Well
and water being satisfactory, I cheerfully paid the well man $448 for the job.

Meantime I contracted for a tank twelve by twelve feet, to be raised thirty feet above the
well on eight timbers, each ten inches square, well bolted and braced, for $430,--I to put
in the foundation. This consisted of eight concrete piers, each five feet deep in the clay,
three feet square, and capped at the level of the ground with a limestone two feet square and
eight inches thick. These piers were set in octagon form around the well, with their centres
seven feet from the middle of the bore, making the spread of the framework fourteen feet at
the ground and ten at the platform. The foundation cost $32. A Rider eight-inch, hot-air, wood-burning,
pumping engine (with a two-inch pipe leading to the tank, and a four-inch pipe from it), filled
the tank quickly; and it was surprising to see how little fuel it consumed. It cost $215.

I have now to confess to a small extravagance. I contracted with a carpenter to build an ornamental
tower, fifty-five feet high, twenty feet across at the base, and fifteen feet at the top, sheeted
and shingled, with a series of small windows in spiral and a narrow stairway leading to a balcony
that surrounded the tower on a level with the top of the tank. This tower cost $425; but it
was not all extravagance, because a third of the expense would have been incurred in protecting
the engine and making the tank frost-proof.

To distribute the water, I had three lines of four-inch pipe leading from the tank's out-flow
pipe. One of these went 250 feet to the house, with one-inch branches for the gardens and lawn;
another led east 375 feet, past the proposed sites of the cottage, the farm-house, the dairy,
and other buildings in that direction; while the third, about 400 feet long, led to the horse
barn and the other projected buildings. From near the end of this west pipe a 1-1/2-inch pipe
was carried due north through the centre of the five-acre lot set apart for the hennery, and
into the fields beyond. This pipe was about 700 feet long. Chapter headings were of. vi. and. vii. were main
near the bottom was for the page-- for printed text, not catchwords-- and again as the top looked
to a following page. This pattern was not consistently followed of
all chapters that began at the top of the page.

The trenches for the pipes were opened by a party of five Italians whom a railroad friend found
for me. These men boarded themselves, slept in the barn, and did the work for seventy-five
cents a rod, the job costing me $169.
