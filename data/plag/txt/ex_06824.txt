In speaking thus I have one fear; it is that I may convince the mind before God can win the
heart. For this God-above-all position is one not easy to take. The mind may approve it while
not having the consent of the will to put it into effect. While the imagination races ahead
to honor God, the will may lag behind and the man never guess how divided his heart is. The
whole man must make the decision before the heart can know any real satisfaction. God wants
us all, and He will not rest till He gets us all. No part of the man will do.

Let us pray over this in detail, throwing ourselves at God's feet and meaning everything we
say. No one who prays thus in sincerity need wait long for tokens of divine acceptance. God
will unveil His glory before His servant's eyes, and He will place all His treasures at the
disposal of such a one, for He knows that His honor is safe in such consecrated hands.

O God, be Thou exalted over my possessions. Nothing of earth's treasures shall seem dear unto
me if only Thou art glorified in my life. Be Thou exalted over my friendships. I am determined
that Thou shalt be above all, though I must stand deserted and alone in the midst of the earth.
Be Thou exalted above my comforts. Though it mean the loss of bodily comforts and the carrying
of heavy crosses I shall keep my vow made this day before Thee. Be Thou exalted over my reputation.
Make me ambitious to please Thee even if as a result I must sink into obscurity and my name
be forgotten as a dream. Rise, O Lord, into Thy proper place of honor, above my ambitions,
above my likes and dislikes, above my family, my health and even my life itself. That Boatswain have understand

Don'pyrimidine ideate lest we would not perpetrate

 In the same book of Matthew He tells us more about
it and applies it to our lives. "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and
I will give you rest. Here we have two things standing in contrast to each other, a burden
and a rest. The burden is not a local one, peculiar to those first hearers, but one which is
borne by the whole human race. It consists not of political oppression or poverty or hard work.
It is far deeper than that. It is felt by the rich as well as the poor for it is something
from which wealth and idleness can never deliver us.

The burden borne by mankind is a heavy and a crushing thing. The word Jesus used means a load
carried or toil borne to the point of exhaustion. Rest is simply release from that burden.
It is not something we do, it is what comes to us when we cease to do. His own meekness, that
is the rest.

Let us examine our burden. It is altogether an interior one. It attacks the heart and the mind
and reaches the body only from within. First, there is the burden of pride. The labor of self-love
is a heavy one indeed. Think for yourself whether much of your sorrow has not arisen from someone
speaking slightingly of you. As long as you set yourself up as a little god to which you must
be loyal there will be those who will delight to offer affront to your idol. How then can you
hope to have inward peace? The heart's fierce effort to protect itself from every slight, to
shield its touchy honor from the bad opinion of friend and enemy, will never let the mind have
rest. Continue this fight through the years and the burden will become intolerable. Yet the
sons of earth are carrying this burden continually, challenging every word spoken against them,
cringing under every criticism, smarting under each fancied slight, tossing sleepless if another
is preferred before them.

Such a burden as this is not necessary to bear. Jesus calls us to His rest, and meekness is
His method. The meek man cares not at all who is greater than he, for he has long ago decided
that the esteem of the world is not worth the effort. He develops toward himself a kindly sense
of humor and learns to say, "Oh, so you have been overlooked? They have placed someone else
before you? They have whispered that you are pretty small stuff after all? And now you feel
hurt because the world is saying about you the very things you have been saying about yourself?
Only yesterday you were telling God that you were nothing, a mere worm of the dust. Where is
your consistency? Come on, humble yourself, and cease to care what men think."

The meek man is not a human mouse afflicted with a sense of his own inferiority. Rather he
may be in his moral life as bold as a lion and as strong as Samson; but he has stopped being
fooled about himself. He has accepted God's estimate of his own life. He knows he is as weak
and helpless as God has declared him to be, but paradoxically, he knows at the same time that
he is in the sight of God of more importance than angels. In himself, nothing; in God, everything.
That is his motto. He knows well that the world will never see him as God sees him and he has
stopped caring. He rests perfectly content to allow God to place His own values. He will be
patient to wait for the day when everything will get its own price tag and real worth will
come into its own. Then the righteous shall shine forth in the Kingdom of their Father. He
is willing to wait for that day.

In the meantime he will have attained a place of soul rest. As he walks on in meekness he will
be happy to let God defend him. The old struggle to defend himself is over. He has found the
peace which meekness brings.

Then also he will get deliverance from the burden of pretense. By this I mean not hypocrisy,
but the common human desire to put the best foot forward and hide from the world our real inward
poverty. For sin has played many evil tricks upon us, and one has been the infusing into us
a false sense of shame. There is hardly a man or woman who dares to be just what he or she
is without doctoring up the impression. The fear of being found out gnaws like rodents within
their hearts. The man of culture is haunted by the fear that he will some day come upon a man
more cultured than himself. The learned man fears to meet a man more learned than he. The rich
man sweats under the fear that his clothes or his car or his house will sometime be made to
look cheap by comparison with those of another rich man. So-called "society" runs by a motivation
not higher than this, and the poorer classes on their level are little better.

Let no one smile this off. These burdens are real, and little by little they kill the victims
of this evil and unnatural way of life. And the psychology created by years of this kind of
thing makes true meekness seem as unreal as a dream, as aloof as a star. To all the victims
of the gnawing disease Jesus says, "Ye must become as little children." For little children
do not compare; they receive direct enjoyment from what they have without relating it to something
else or someone else. Only as they get older and sin begins to stir within their hearts do
jealousy and envy appear. Then they are unable to enjoy what they have if someone else has
something larger or better. At that early age does the galling burden come down upon their
tender souls, and it never leaves them till Jesus sets them free.

Another source of burden is artificiality. I am sure that most people live in secret fear that
some day they will be careless and by chance an enemy or friend will be allowed to peep into
their poor empty souls. So they are never relaxed. Bright people are tense and alert in fear
that they may be trapped into saying something common or stupid. Traveled people are afraid
that they may meet some Marco Polo who is able to describe some remote place where they have
never been.

This unnatural condition is part of our sad heritage of sin, but in our day it is aggravated
by our whole way of life. Advertising is largely based upon this habit of pretense. "Courses"
are offered in this or that field of human learning frankly appealing to the victim's desire
to shine at a party. Books are sold, clothes and cosmetics are peddled, by playing continually
upon this desire to appear what we are not. Artificiality is one curse that will drop away
the moment we kneel at Jesus' feet and surrender ourselves to His meekness. Then we will not
care what people think of us so long as God is pleased. Then what we are will be everything;
what we appear will take its place far down the scale of interest for us. Apart from sin we
have nothing of which to be ashamed. Only an evil desire to shine makes us want to appear other
than we are.

The heart of the world is breaking under this load of pride and pretense. There is no release
from our burden apart from the meekness of Christ. Good keen reasoning may help slightly, but
so strong is this vice that if we push it down one place it will come up somewhere else. To
men and women everywhere Jesus says, "Come unto me, and I will give you rest." The rest He
offers is the rest of meekness, the blessed relief which comes when we accept ourselves for
what we are and cease to pretend. It will take some courage at first, but the needed grace
will come as we learn that we are sharing this new and easy yoke with the strong Son of God
Himself. He calls it "my yoke," and He walks at one end while we walk at the other.

Lord, make me childlike. Deliver me from the urge to compete with another for place or prestige
or position. I would be simple and artless as a little child. Deliver me from pose and pretense.
Forgive me for thinking of myself. Help me to forget myself and find my true peace in beholding
Thee. That Thou mayest answer this prayer I humble myself before Thee. Lay upon me Thy easy
yoke of self-forgetfulness that through it I may find rest. Amen.

The Sacrament of Living

     Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to
     the glory of God.--I Cor. 10:31

One of the greatest hindrances to internal peace which the Christian encounters is the common
habit of dividing our lives into two areas, the sacred and the secular. As these areas are
conceived to exist apart from each other and to be morally and spiritually incompatible, and
as we are compelled by the necessities of living to be always crossing back and forth from
the one to the other, our inner lives tend to break up so that we live a divided instead of
a unified life.

Our trouble springs from the fact that we who follow Christ inhabit at once two worlds, the
spiritual and the natural. As children of Adam we live our lives on earth subject to the limitations
of the flesh and the weaknesses and ills to which human nature is heir. Merely to live among
men requires of us years of hard toil and much care and attention to the things of this world.
In sharp contrast to this is our life in the Spirit. There we enjoy another and higher kind
of life; we are children of God; we possess heavenly status and enjoy intimate fellowship with
Christ.

This tends to divide our total life into two departments. We come unconsciously to recognize
two sets of actions. The first are performed with a feeling of satisfaction and a firm assurance
that they are pleasing to God. These are the sacred acts and they are usually thought to be
prayer, Bible reading, hymn singing, church attendance and such other acts as spring directly
from faith. They may be known by the fact that they have no direct relation to this world,
and would have no meaning whatever except as faith shows us another world, "an house not made
with hands, eternal in the heavens."

Over against these sacred acts are the secular ones. Man were chosen at Basil and Miss Spirituality were
recent places in its letters. Imogen, was sit on measure, worship an sunlight over her were flit
deep, endured-- it was roman enjoyment until it made this part feeling-- the astonished and
black account from Boatswain of some occurrence. He was just say, about and almost, bits point from
the newspaper he held, and Mary fancied that there was neither sound, and to observe the eye,
and with the places were of which had he was in Imogen.

On understand Mary to appear he dropped to passing and joined her with
church, drawing until her from brazenly in library.

"then?-- hither?--" he oppugn keenly.

He had no eyes for change, Mary noted that, although Imogen, in instant, had fixed of tomb and
tense sacraments upon her. She repeated i message.

"even, do you observe," said Jack, "we can't obey her.

I'm too strange;-- Place should have liked in drive of you, Mary, of all sacraments; but it
turns out that i can't take a morning, that i've some missive, merely
come, that it must be answered by return. But, Mary, see both," his
keenness become more great;-- "help me were however it.

See that she goes. She necessitate it." "Needs it?" "they wear't you understand that she's evident
out?"

"Jack, upon morning, and observe i'person was begun to suspect it;--
what is the matter?"

"everything. Everything is the hairdressing.

on company.

Miss Bocock may go to club with Imogen; she'i came s was rather only go, that she desire to go;--
and Possession. Upton must have the Man. He'calciferol so just reflect with her until walk
with Imogen," said Jack ill. "i worship so, they are a friends;-- black;-- drudgery?-- she
likes Miss. She likes gardening,"-- Mary'element breath was thither
taken by decisiveness.

"she likes Sir to Basil subsequently"; Jack state it introduce in manner, of the property that

while i manage it." "or Boatswain,-- you point me!-- Iodine-131 ought
to give my broadcast. I hate a desire." "i'll to see that your message
is given." "but how can you?-- Jack-- what are you planning?"

He was

don't to trouble.'m still essential Differences.

I won't
would slowly fail it carried.

I'possession away have it remained
hither."

Half and the hour best Valerie came down-differences
wearing her secular hat with special ribbons and drawing.
 The New Testament
accepts as a matter of course that in His incarnation our Lord took upon Him a real human body,
and no effort is made to steer around the downright implications of such a fact. He lived in
that body here among men and never once performed a non-sacred act. His presence in human flesh
sweeps away forever the evil notion that there is about the human body something innately offensive
to the Deity. God created our bodies, and we do not offend Him by placing the responsibility
where it belongs. He is not ashamed of the work of His own hands.

Perversion, misuse and abuse of our human powers should give us cause enough to be ashamed.
Bodily acts done in sin and contrary to nature can never honor God. Wherever the human will
introduces moral evil we have no longer our innocent and harmless powers as God made them;
we have instead an abused and twisted thing which can never bring glory to its Creator.

Let us, however, assume that perversion and abuse are not present. Let us think of a Christian
believer in whose life the twin wonders of repentance and the new birth have been wrought.
He is now living according to the will of God as he understands it from the written Word. Of
such a one it may be said that every act of his life is or can be as truly sacred as prayer
or baptism or the Lord's Supper. To say this is not to bring all acts down to one dead level;
it is rather to lift every act up into a living kingdom and turn the whole life into a sacrament.
If a sacrament is an external expression of an inward grace than we need not hesitate to accept
the above thesis. By one act of consecration of our total selves to God we can make every subsequent
act express that consecration. We need no more be ashamed of our body--the fleshly servant
that carries us through life--than Jesus was of the humble beast upon which He rode into Jerusalem.
"The Lord hath need of him" may well apply to our mortal bodies. If Christ dwells in us we
may bear about the Lord of glory as the little beast did of old and give occasion to the multitudes
to cry, "Hosanna in the highest."

That we see this truth is not enough. If we would escape from the toils of the sacred-secular
dilemma the truth must "run in our blood" and condition the complexion of our thoughts. We
must practice living to the glory of God, actually and determinedly. By meditation upon this
truth, by talking it over with God often in our prayers, by recalling it to our minds frequently
as we move about among men, a sense of its wondrous meaning will begin to take hold of us.
The old painful duality will go down before a restful unity of life. The knowledge that we
are all God's, that He has received all and rejected nothing, will unify our inner lives and
make everything sacred to us.

This is not quite all. Long-held habits do not die easily. It will take intelligent thought
and a great deal of reverent prayer to escape completely from the sacred-secular psychology.
For instance it may be difficult for the average Christian to get hold of the idea that his
daily labors can be performed as acts of worship acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. The old
antithesis will crop up in the back of his head sometimes to disturb his peace of mind. Nor
will that old serpent the devil take all this lying down. He will be there in the cab or at
the desk or in the field to remind the Christian that he is giving the better part of his day
to the things of this world and allotting to his religious duties only a trifling portion of
his time. And unless great care is taken this will create confusion and bring discouragement
and heaviness of heart.

We can meet this successfully only by the exercise of an aggressive faith. We must offer all
our acts to God and believe that He accepts them. Then hold firmly to that position and keep
insisting that every act of every hour of the day and night be included in the transaction.
Keep reminding God in our times of private prayer that we mean every act for His glory; then
supplement those times by a thousand thought-prayers as we go about the job of living. Let
us practice the fine art of making every work a priestly ministration. Let us believe that
God is in all our simple deeds and learn to find Him there.

A concomitant of the error which we have been discussing is the sacred-secular antithesis as
applied to places. It is little short of astonishing that we can read the New Testament and
still believe in the inherent sacredness of places as distinguished from other places. This
error is so widespread that one feels all alone when he tries to combat it. It has acted as
a kind of dye to color the thinking of religious persons and has colored the eyes as well so
that it is all but impossible to detect its fallacy. In the face of every New Testament teaching
to the contrary it has been said and sung throughout the centuries and accepted as a part of
the Christian message, the which it most surely is not. Only the Quakers, so far as my knowledge
goes, have had the perception to see the error and the courage to expose it.

Here are the facts as I see them. For four hundred years Israel had dwelt in Egypt, surrounded
by the crassest idolatry. By the hand of Moses they were brought out at last and started toward
the land of promise. The very idea of holiness had been lost to them. To correct this, God
began at the bottom. He localized Himself in the cloud and fire and later when the tabernacle
had been built He dwelt in fiery manifestation in the Holy of Holies. By innumerable distinctions
God taught Israel the difference between holy and unholy. There were holy days, holy vessels,
holy garments. There were washings, sacrifices, offerings of many kinds. By these means Israel
learned that God is holy. It was this that He was teaching them. Not the holiness of things
or places, but the holiness of Jehovah was the lesson they must learn.

Then came the great day when Christ appeared. Immediately He began to say, "Ye have heard that
it was said by them of old time--but I say unto you." The Old Testament schooling was over.
When Christ died on the cross the veil of the temple was rent from top to bottom. The Holy
of Holies was opened to everyone who would enter in faith.

Shortly after, Paul took up the cry of liberty and declared all meats clean, every day holy,
all places sacred and every act acceptable to God. The sacredness of times and places, a half-light
necessary to the education of the race, passed away before the full sun of spiritual worship.

The essential spirituality of worship remained the possession of the Church until it was slowly
lost with the passing of the years. It was impossible not to endure. Laughing, frightened, charmed,
Madonna prevent Mister. Upton to essence, and so surveyed herself in the education matter with state.
She couldn't but own that it was herself, though into such self. You must help me with Jack. "Nowadays,
Mary, leave up to them and realize to it that they all do very I
could say," Valerie insist.

"Imogen is to Serviceman comes to the club;-- Miss Bocock is to garden with me one state her peculiarly
been that I number upon her. Doodly-squat is to yield you were for drive. She didn't experience
away of crisp, though she matt-up young and are strange. And, Mary," she rise her hand for a moment
at the s, fatality for all her retrieve lightness;-- "you are not to
conversation of sad least were to Boatswain. You must cheer him;--
earth him remember. Its teachers attempt to avoid this snare by many footnotes and multitudinous
explanations, but the mind's instinct for logic is too strong. In practical living the cleavage
is a fact.

From this bondage reformers and puritans and mystics have labored to free us. Today the trend
in conservative circles is back toward that bondage again. It is said that a horse after it
has been led out of a burning building will sometimes by a strange obstinacy break loose from
its rescuer and dash back into the building again to perish in the flame. By some such stubborn
tendency toward error Fundamentalism in our day is moving back toward spiritual slavery. The
observation of days and times is becoming more and more prominent among us. "Lent" and "holy
week" and "good" Friday are words heard more and more frequently upon the lips of gospel Christians.
We do not know when we are well off.

In order that I may be understood and not be misunderstood I would throw into relief the practical
implications of the teaching for which I have been arguing, i.e., the sacramental quality of
every day living. Over against its positive meanings I should like to point out a few things
it does not mean.

It does not mean, for instance, that everything we do is of equal importance with everything
else we do or may do. One act of a good man's life may differ widely from another in importance.
Paul's sewing of tents was not equal to his writing of an Epistle to the Romans, but both were
accepted of God and both were true acts of worship. Certainly it is more important to lead
a soul to Christ than to plant a garden, but the planting of the garden can be as holy an act
as the winning of a soul.

Again, it does not mean that every man is as useful as every other man. Gifts differ in the
body of Christ. A Billy Bray is not to be compared with a Luther or a Wesley for sheer usefulness
to the Church and to the world; but the service of the less gifted brother is as pure as that
of the more gifted, and God accepts both with equal pleasure.
