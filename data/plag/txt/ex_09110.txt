On Michaelmas day--and during these two months I hadn't, I do believe, seen my mother twice
(once, about two o'clock in the morning, I woke and found her sobbing over my bed)--on Michaelmas-day
morning, Eliza comes to me and says, "ROBERT, THEY WILL COME AND FETCH US AT SIX THIS EVENING."
Well, as this was the last day, I went and got the best goose I could find (I don't think I
ever saw a primer, or ate more hearty myself), and had it roasted at three, with a good pudding
afterwards; and a glorious bowl of punch. "Here's a health to you, dear girls," says I, "and
you, Ma, and good luck to all three; and as you've not eaten a morsel, I hope you won't object
to a glass of punch. It's the old stuff, you know, Ma'am, that that Waters sent to my father
fifteen years ago."

Six o'clock came, and with it came a fine barouche. As I live, Captain Waters was on the box
(it was his coach); that old thief, Bates, jumped out, entered my house, and before I could
say Jack Robinson, whipped off mamma to the carriage: the girls followed, just giving me a
hasty shake of the hand; and as mamma was helped in, Mary Waters, who was sitting inside, flung
her arms round her, and then round the girls; and the Doctor, who acted footman, jumped on
the box, and off they went; taking no more notice of ME than if I'd been a nonentity.

Here's a picture of the whole business:--Mamma and Miss Waters are sitting kissing each other
in the carriage, with the two girls in the back seat: Waters is driving (a precious bad driver
he is too); and I'm standing at the garden door, and whistling. That old fool Mary Malowney
is crying behind the garden gate: she went off next day along with the furniture; and I to
get into that precious scrape which I shall mention next.

SEPTEMBER.--PLUCKING A GOOSE.

After my papa's death, as he left me no money, and only a little land, I put my estate into
an auctioneer's hands, and determined to amuse my solitude with a trip to some of our fashionable
watering-places. My house was now a desert to me. I need not say how the departure of my dear
parent, and her children, left me sad and lonely.

Well, I had a little ready money, and, for the estate, expected a couple of thousand pounds.
I had a good military-looking person: for though I had absolutely cut the old North Bungays
(indeed, after my affair with Waters, Colonel Craw hinted to me, in the most friendly manner,
that I had better resign)--though I had left the army, I still retained the rank of Captain;
knowing the advantages attendant upon that title in a watering-place tour.

Captain Stubbs became a great dandy at Cheltenham, Harrogate, Bath, Leamington, and other places.
I was a good whist and billiard player; so much so, that in many of these towns, the people
used to refuse, at last, to play with me, knowing how far I was their superior. Fancy my surprise,
about five years after the Portsmouth affair, when strolling one day up the High Street, in
Leamington, my eyes lighted upon a young man, whom I remembered in a certain butcher's yard,
and elsewhere--no other, in fact, than Dobble. He, too, was dressed en militaire, with a frogged
coat and spurs; and was walking with a showy-looking, Jewish-faced, black-haired lady, glittering
with chains and rings, with a green bonnet and a bird-of-Paradise--a lilac shawl, a yellow
gown, pink silk stockings, and light-blue shoes. Three children, and a handsome footman, were
walking behind her, and the party, not seeing me, entered the "Royal Hotel" together.

I was known myself at the "Royal," and calling one of the waiters, learned the names of the
lady and gentleman. He was Captain Dobble, the son of the rich army-clothier, Dobble (Dobble,
Hobble and Co. of Pall Mall);--the lady was a Mrs. Manasseh, widow of an American Jew, living
quietly at Leamington with her children, but possessed of an immense property. There's no use
to give one's self out to be an absolute pauper: so the fact is, that I myself went everywhere
with the character of a man of very large means. My father had died, leaving me immense sums
of money, and landed estates. Ah! I was the gentleman then, the real gentleman, and everybody
was too happy to have me at table.

Well, I came the next day, and left a card for Dobble, with a note. He neither returned my
visit, nor answered my note. The day after, however, I met him with the widow, as before; and
going up to him, very kindly seized him by the hand, and swore I was--as really was the case--charmed
to see him. Dobble hung back, to my surprise, and I do believe the creature would have cut
me, if he dared; but I gave him a frown, and said--

"What, Dobble, my boy, don't you recollect old Stubbs, and our adventure with the butcher's
daughters--ha?"

Dobble gave a sickly kind of grin, and said, "Oh! ah! yes! It is--yes! it is, I believe, Captain
Stubbs."

"An old comrade, Madam, of Captain Dobble's, and one who has heard so much, and seen so much
of your ladyship, that he must take the liberty of begging his friend to introduce him."

Dobble was obliged to take the hint; and Captain Stubbs was duly presented to Mrs. Manasseh.
The lady was as gracious as possible; and when, at the end of the walk, we parted, she said
"she hoped Captain Dobble would bring me to her apartments that evening, where she expected
a few friends." Everybody, you see, knows everybody at Leamington; and I, for my part, was
well known as a retired officer of the army, who, on his father's death, had come into seven
thousand a year. Dobble's arrival had been subsequent to mine; but putting up as he did at
the "Royal Hotel," and dining at the ordinary there with the widow, he had made her acquaintance
before I had. I saw, however, that if I allowed him to talk about me, as he could, I should
be compelled to give up all my hopes and pleasures at Leamington; and so I determined to be
short with him. As soon as the lady had gone into the hotel, my friend Dobble was for leaving
me likewise; but I stopped him and said, "Mr. Dobble, I saw what you meant just now: you wanted
to cut me, because, forsooth, I did not choose to fight a duel at Portsmouth. Now look you,
Dobble, I am no hero, but I'm not such a coward as you--and you know it. You are a very different
man to deal with from Waters; and I WILL FIGHT this time."

Not perhaps that I would: but after the business of the butcher, I knew Dobble to be as great
a coward as ever lived; and there never was any harm in threatening, for you know you are not
obliged to stick to it afterwards. My words had their effect upon Dobble, who stuttered and
looked red, and then declared he never had the slightest intention of passing me by; so we
became friends, and his mouth was stopped.

He was very thick with the widow, but that lady had a very capacious heart, and there were
a number of other gentlemen who seemed equally smitten with her. "Look at that Mrs. Manasseh,"
said a gentleman (it was droll, HE was a Jew, too) sitting at dinner by me. "She is old, and
ugly, and yet, because she has money, all the men are flinging themselves at her."

"She has money, has she?"

"Eighty thousand pounds, and twenty thousand for each of her children. I know it FOR A FACT,"
said the strange gentleman. "I am in the law, and we of our faith, you know, know pretty well
what the great families amongst us are worth." 

During time champagne is that poor party of all Algonquian be commenced

 I paid, of course, for everything; and until our house in Berkeley Square was
painted, we stopped at "Stevens's Hotel."

*****

My own estate had been sold, and the money was lying at a bank in the City. About three days
after our arrival, as we took our breakfast in the hotel, previous to a visit to Mrs. Stubbs's
banker, where certain little transfers were to be made, a gentleman was introduced, who, I
saw at a glance, was of my wife's persuasion.

He looked at Mrs. Stubbs, and made a bow. "Perhaps it will be convenient to you to pay this
little bill, one hundred and fifty-two pounds?"

"My love," says she, "will you pay this--it is a trifle which I had really forgotten?"

"My soul!" said I, "I have really not the money in the house."

"Vel, denn, Captain Shtubbsh," says he, "I must do my duty--and arrest you--here is the writ!
Tom, keep the door?" My wife fainted--the children screamed, and I fancy my condition as I
was obliged to march off to a spunging-house along with a horrid sheriff's officer?

OCTOBER.--MARS AND VENUS IN OPPOSITION.

I shall not describe my feelings when I found myself in a cage in Cursitor Street, instead
of that fine house in Berkeley Square, which was to have been mine as the husband of Mrs. Manasseh.
What a place!--in an odious, dismal street leading from Chancery Lane. A hideous Jew boy opened
the second of three doors and shut it when Mr. Nabb and I (almost fainting) had entered; then
he opened the third door, and then I was introduced to a filthy place called a coffee-room,
which I exchanged for the solitary comfort of a little dingy back-parlor, where I was left
for a while to brood over my miserable fate. Fancy the change between this and Berkeley Square!
Was I, after all my pains, and cleverness, and perseverance, cheated at last? Had this Mrs.
Manasseh been imposing upon me, and were the words of the wretch I met at the table-d'hote
at Leamington only meant to mislead me and take me in? I determined to send for my wife, and
know the whole truth. I saw at once that I had been the victim of an infernal plot, and that
the carriage, the house in town, the West India fortune, were only so many lies which I had
blindly believed. It was true that the debt was but a hundred and fifty pounds; and I had two
thousand at my bankers'. But was the loss of HER 80,000L. nothing? Was the destruction of my
hopes nothing? The accursed addition to my family of a Jewish wife and three Jewish children,
nothing? And all these I was to support out of my two thousand pounds. I had better have stopped
at home with my mamma and sisters, whom I really did love, and who produced me eighty pounds
a year.

I had a furious interview with Mrs. Stubbs; and when I charged her, the base wretch! with cheating
me, like a brazen serpent as she was, she flung back the cheat in my teeth, and swore I had
swindled her. Why did I marry her, when she might have had twenty others? She only took me,
she said, because I had twenty thousand pounds. I HAD said I possessed that sum; but in love,
you know, and war all's fair.

We parted quite as angrily as we met; and I cordially vowed that when I had paid the debt into
which I had been swindled by her, I would take my 2,000L. and depart to some desert island;
or, at the very least, to America, and never see her more, or any of her Israelitish brood.
There was no use in remaining in the spunging-house (for I knew that there were such things
as detainers, and that where Mrs. Stubbs owed a hundred pounds, she might owe a thousand) so
I sent for Mr. Nabb, and tendering him a cheque for 150L. and his costs, requested to be let
out forthwith. "Here, fellow," said I, "is a cheque on Child's for your paltry sum."

"It may be a sheck on Shild's," says Mr. Nabb; "but I should be a baby to let you out on such
a paper as dat."

"Well," said I, "Child's is but a step from this: you may go and get the cash,--just give me
an acknowledgment."

Nabb drew out the acknowledgment with great punctuality, and set off for the bankers', whilst
I prepared myself for departure from this abominable prison.

He smiled as he came in. "Well," said I, "you have touched your money; and now, I must tell
you, that you are the most infernal rogue and extortioner I ever met with."

"Oh, no, Mishter Shtubbsh," says he, grinning still. "Dere is som greater roag dan me,--mosh
greater."

"Fellow," said I, "don't stand grinning before a gentleman; but give me my hat and cloak, and
let me leave your filthy den."

"Shtop, Shtubbsh," says he, not even Mistering me this time. "Here ish a letter, vich you had
better read."

I opened the letter; something fell to the ground:--it was my cheque.

The letter ran thus: "Messrs. Child and Co. present their compliments to Captain Stubbs, and
regret that they have been obliged to refuse payment of the enclosed, having been served this
day with an attachment by Messrs. Solomonson and Co., which compels them to retain Captain
Stubbs' balance of 2,010L. 11s. 6d. until the decision of the suit of Solomonson v. Stubbs.

"FLEET STREET."

"You see," says Mr. Nabb, as I read this dreadful letter--"you see, Shtubbsh, dere vas two
debts,--a little von and a big von. So dey arrested you for de little von, and attashed your
money for de big von."

Don't laugh at me for telling this story. If you knew what tears are blotting over the paper
as I write it--if you knew that for weeks after I was more like a madman than a sane man,--a
madman in the Fleet Prison, where I went instead of to the desert island! What had I done to
deserve it? Hadn't I always kept an eye to the main chance? Hadn't I lived economically, and
not like other young men? Had I ever been known to squander or give away a single penny? No!
I can lay my hand on my heart, and, thank heaven, say, No! Why, why was I punished so?

Let me conclude this miserable history. Seven months--my wife saw me once or twice, and then
dropped me altogether--I remained in that fatal place. I wrote to my dear mamma, begging her
to sell her furniture, but got no answer. All my old friends turned their backs upon me. My
action went against me--I had not a penny to defend it. Solomonson proved my wife's debt, and
seized my two thousand pounds. As for the detainer against me, I was obliged to go through
the court for the relief of insolvent debtors. I passed through it, and came out a beggar.
But fancy the malice of that wicked Stiffelkind: he appeared in court as my creditor for 3L.,
with sixteen years' interest at five per cent, for a PAIR OF TOP-BOOTS. The old thief produced
them in court, and told the whole story--Lord Cornwallis, the detection, the pumping and all.

Commissioner Dubobwig was very funny about it. "So Doctor Swishtail would not pay you for the
boots, eh, Mr. Stiffelkind?"

"No: he said, ven I asked him for payment, dey was ordered by a yong boy, and I ought to have
gone to his schoolmaster."

"What! then you came on a BOOTLESS errand, ay, sir?" (A laugh.)

"Bootless! no sare, I brought de boots back vid me. How de devil else could I show dem to you?"
(Another laugh.)

"You've never SOLED 'em since, Mr. Tickleshins?"

"I never would sell dem; I svore I never vood, on porpus to be revenged on dat Stobbs."

"What! your wound has never been HEALED, eh?"

"Vat do you mean vid your bootless errands, and your soling and healing? I tell you I have
done vat I svore to do: I have exposed him at school; I have broak off a marriage for him,
ven he vould have had tventy tousand pound; and now I have showed him up in a court of justice.
Dat is vat I 'ave done, and dat's enough." And then the old wretch went down, whilst everybody
was giggling and staring at poor me--as if I was not miserable enough already.

"This seems the dearest pair of boots you ever had in your life, Mr. Stubbs," said Commissioner
Dubobwig very archly, and then he began to inquire about the rest of my misfortunes.

In the fulness of my heart I told him the whole of them: how Mr. Solomonson the attorney had
introduced me to the rich widow, Mrs. Manasseh, who had fifty thousand pounds, and an estate
in the West Indies. How I was married, and arrested on coming to town, and cast in an action
for two thousand pounds brought against me by this very Solomonson for my wife's debts.

"Stop!" says a lawyer in the court. "Is this woman a showy black-haired woman with one eye?
very often drunk, with three children?--Solomonson, short, with red hair?"

"Exactly so," said I, with tears in my eyes.

"That woman has married THREE MEN within the last two years. One in Ireland, and one at Bath.
A Solomonson is, I believe, her husband, and they both are off for America ten days ago."

"But why did you not keep your 2,000L.?" said the lawyer.

"Sir, they attached it."

"Oh, well, we may pass you. You have been unlucky, Mr. Stubbs, but it seems as if the biter
had been bit in this affair."

"No," said Mr. Dubobwig. "Mr. Stubbs is the victim of a FATAL ATTACHMENT."

NOVEMBER.--A GENERAL POST DELIVERY.

I was a free man when I went out of the Court; but I was a beggar--I, Captain Stubbs, of the
bold North Bungays, did not know where I could get a bed, or a dinner.

As I was marching sadly down Portugal Street, I felt a hand on my shoulder and a rough voice
which I knew well.

"Vell, Mr. Stobbs, have I not kept my promise? I told you dem boots would be your ruin."

I was much too miserable to reply; and only cast my eyes towards the roofs of the houses, which
I could not see for the tears.

"Vat! you begin to gry and blobber like a shild? you vood marry, vood you? and noting vood
do for you but a vife vid monny--ha, ha--but you vere de pigeon, and she was de grow. She has
plocked you, too, pretty vell--eh? ha! ha!"

"Oh, Mr. Stiffelkind," said I, "don't laugh at my misery: she has not left me a single shilling
under heaven. And I shall starve: I do believe I shall starve." And I began to cry fit to break
my heart.

"Starf! stoff and nonsense! You vill never die of starfing--you vill die of HANGING, I tink--ho!
ho!--and it is moch easier vay too." I didn't say a word, but cried on; till everybody in the
street turned round and stared.

"Come, come," said Stiffelkind, "do not gry, Gaptain Stobbs--it is not goot for a Gaptain to
gry--ha! ha! Dere--come vid me, and you shall have a dinner, and a bregfast too,--vich shall
gost you nothing, until you can bay vid your earnings."

And so this curious old man, who had persecuted me all through my prosperity, grew compassionate
towards me in my ill-luck; and took me home with him as he promised. "I saw your name among
de Insolvents, and I vowed, you know, to make you repent dem boots. Dere, now, it is done and
forgotten, look you. Here, Betty, Bettchen, make de spare bed, and put a clean knife and fork;
Lort Cornvallis is come to dine vid me."

I lived with this strange old man for six weeks. I kept his books, and did what little I could
to make myself useful: carrying about boots and shoes, as if I had never borne his Majesty's
commission. He gave me no money, but he fed and lodged me comfortably. The men and boys used
to laugh, and call me General, and Lord Cornwallis, and all sorts of nicknames; and old Stiffelkind
made a thousand new ones for me.

One day I can recollect--one miserable day, as I was polishing on the trees a pair of boots
of Mr. Stiffelkind's manufacture--the old gentleman came into the shop, with a lady on his arm.

"Vere is Gaptain Stobbs?" said he. "Vere is dat ornament to his Majesty's service?"

I came in from the back shop, where I was polishing the boots, with one of them in my hand.

"Look, my dear," says he, "here is an old friend of yours, his Excellency Lort Cornvallis!--Who
would have thought such a nobleman vood turn shoeblack? Captain Stobbs, here is your former
flame, my dear niece, Miss Grotty. How could you, Magdalen, ever leaf such a lof of a man?
Shake hands vid her, Gaptain;--dere, never mind de blacking!" But Miss drew back.

"I never shake hands with a SHOEBLACK," said she, mighty contemptuous.

"Bah! my lof, his fingers von't soil you. Don't you know he has just been VITEVASHED?"

"I wish, uncle," says she, "you would not leave me with such low people."

"Low, because he cleans boots? De Gaptain prefers PUMPS to boots I tink--ha! ha!"

"Captain indeed! a nice Captain," says Miss Crutty, snapping her fingers in my face, and walking
away: "a Captain who has had his nose pulled! ha! ha!"--And how could I help it? it wasn't
by my own CHOICE that that ruffian Waters took such liberties with me. Didn't I show how averse
I was to all quarrels by refusing altogether his challenge?--But such is the world. And thus
the people at Stiffelkind's used to tease me, until they drove me almost mad.

At last he came home one day more merry and abusive than ever. "Gaptain," says he, "I have
goot news for you--a goot place. Your lordship vill not be able to geep your garridge, but
you vill be gomfortable, and serve his Majesty."

"Serve his Majesty?" says I. "Dearest Mr. Stiffelkind, have you got me a place under Government?"

"Yes, and somting better still--not only a place, but a uniform: yes, Gaptain Stobbs, a RED GOAT."

"A red coat! I hope you don't think I would demean myself by entering the ranks of the army?
I am a gentleman, Mr. Stiffelkind--I can never--no, I never--"

*****

I was so disgusted with Stiffelkind's brutal jokes, which were now more brutal than ever, that
when I got my place in the Post Office, I never went near the fellow again: for though he had
done me a favor in keeping me from starvation, he certainly had done it in a very rude, disagreeable
manner, and showed a low and mean spirit in SHOVING me into such a degraded place as that of
postman. But what had I to do? I submitted to fate, and for three years or more, Robert Stubbs,
of the North Bungay Fencibles, was--

I wonder nobody recognized me. I lived in daily fear the first year: but afterwards grew accustomed
to my situation, as all great men will do, and wore my red coat as naturally as if I had been
sent into the world only for the purpose of being a letter-carrier.

I was first in the Whitechapel district, where I stayed for nearly three years, when I was
transferred to Jermyn Street and Duke Street--famous places for lodgings. I suppose I left
a hundred letters at a house in the latter street, where lived some people who must have recognized
me had they but once chanced to look at me.

You see that when I left Sloffemsquiggle, and set out in the gay world, my mamma had written
to me a dozen times at least; but I never answered her, for I knew she wanted money, and I
detest writing. Well, she stopped her letters, finding she could get none from me:--but when
I was in the Fleet, as I told you, I wrote repeatedly to my dear mamma, and was not a little
nettled at her refusing to notice me in my distress, which is the very time one most wants notice.

Stubbs is not an uncommon name; and though I saw MRS. STUBBS on a little bright brass plate,
in Duke street, and delivered so many letters to the lodgers in her house, I never thought
of asking who she was, or whether she was my relation, or not. 

Keawe being in bottle of a bottle which must infallibly dispose him by hell-flames unless he can bring
from it of a committed wife, Mr his doom to the stratagem purchases the possession at him,
and stands certain to a price has he has escaped. And when I said, "Never mind, Ma'am, it's no trouble," the old lady gave
a start, and then she pulled off her spectacles, and staggered back; and then she began muttering,
as if about to choke; and then she gave a great screech, and flung herself into my arms, and
roared out, "MY SON, MY SON!"

"Law, mamma," said I, "is that you?" and I sat down on the hall bench with her, and let her
kiss me as much as ever she liked. Hearing the whining and crying, down comes another lady
from up stairs,--it was my sister Eliza; and down come the lodgers. And the maid gets water
and what not, and I was the regular hero of the group. I could not stay long then, having my
letters to deliver. But, in the evening, after mail-time, I went back to my mamma and sister;
and, over a bottle of prime old port, and a precious good leg of boiled mutton and turnips,
made myself pretty comfortable, I can tell you.

DECEMBER.--"THE WINTER OF OUR DISCONTENT."

Mamma had kept the house in Duke Street for more than two years. I recollected some of the
chairs and tables from dear old Sloffemsquiggle, and the bowl in which I had made that famous
rum-punch, the evening she went away, which she and my sisters left untouched, and I was obliged
to drink after they were gone; but that's not to the purpose.

Think of my sister Lucy's luck! that chap, Waters, fell in love with her, and married her;
and she now keeps her carriage, and lives in state near Sloffemsquiggle. I offered to make
it up with Waters; but he bears malice, and never will see or speak to me.--He had the impudence,
too, to say, that he took in all letters for mamma at Sloffemsquiggle; and that as mine were
all begging-letters, he burned them, and never said a word to her concerning them. He allowed
mamma fifty pounds a year, and, if she were not such a fool, she might have had three times
as much; but the old lady was high and mighty forsooth, and would not be beholden, even to
her own daughter, for more than she actually wanted. Even this fifty pound she was going to
refuse; but when I came to live with her, of course I wanted pocket-money as well as board
and lodging, and so I had the fifty pounds for MY share, and eked out with it as well as I could.

Old Bates and the Captain, between them, gave mamma a hundred pounds when she left me (she
had the deuce's own luck, to be sure--much more than ever fell to ME, I know) and as she said
she WOULD try and work for her living, it was thought best to take a house and let lodgings,
which she did. Our first and second floor paid us four guineas a week, on an average; and the
front parlor and attic made forty pounds more. Mamma and Eliza used to have the front attic:
but I took that, and they slept in the servants' bedroom. Lizzy had a pretty genius for work,
and earned a guinea a week that way; so that we had got nearly two hundred a year over the
rent to keep house with,--and we got on pretty well. Besides, women eat nothing: my women didn't
care for meat for days together sometimes,--so that it was only necessary to dress a good steak
or so for me.

Mamma would not think of my continuing in the Post Office. She said her dear Robert, her husband's
son, her gallant soldier, and all that, should remain at home and be a gentleman--which I was,
certainly, though I didn't find fifty pounds a year very much to buy clothes and be a gentleman
upon. To be sure, mother found me shirts and linen, so that THAT wasn't in the fifty pounds. These
four last named were not clothes and weather of her gentleman, who held gallant places in the
council, and were persons upon fifty year to much war. And her find t at the son, two others who
were a Eagle and the Tortoise. She was so VERY soft, the old lady!
