He was not quite sure that his brain hadn't given way, and that her presence was not a mere
manifestation of the fact. He had never been able to trust himself sufficiently to go near
the Medhursts. Sedulously keeping to the London south of the river and to the immediate vicinity
of his work--save on his rare visits to Belgrave Square--he had run but little risk of encountering
any of them or, indeed, any other acquaintances. He was aware the Medhursts knew he was in
London and employed by a large firm, but they had never been told the exact details of his
whereabouts. However, he found himself shaking hands with Margaret but too bewildered to say
anything.

"What a strange expression in your face, Morgan! It seems to ask any number of questions, but
I can't make out whether it looks pleased or angry. At least be polite enough to make me welcome.
It's nice and warm in here, so I think I'd better take my jacket off." Geneva has so much poetry and so entrancing lake seduction their multiple reflections,
their vague rumors, its transparency and its dazzling waves sweetest, one feels like a dream
delighted and transported to remote regions of the Alps and the Jura.

If the French Genevan differs from the seriousness and circumspection, lacking the playful vibrancy
and sharpness that joke they call esprit, if his accent is hard and French very bad (in most
of the middle class and the masses), and if physiognomic types, although revealing much intelligence,
are gentle and lack the self-energy lines of purebreds, also has very valuable qualities. Enthusiastic
public interests and fine causes, sober and serious words in his convictions, laborious and persuaded
the nobility of work, their customs are pure, without any cannot, and in all consciousness
manifest acts have equal right and duty. Geneva is not a single beggar or a drunk, and except
for those who travel for pleasure is no idle there. The French verb flaner [6] so characteristic
of Paris, has no significance in Geneva.

[6] Spend time as a slacker, walking in public places and curiously aimless pointless.

As works of art, the monuments of this city are not of much interest. If modern Gate-New and
some are elegant and well suited to its objects, the former are a solid architecture, heavy
and cold. The botanical garden, though small and relatively Again, it's funny and well equipped and
maintained. The Museum's collections are academic abundant and valuable. Besides the public
library, containing over 40,000 volumes printed and 500 manuscripts, some of these very interesting
or curious [7] Society Reading has an upper cabinet that there are 35,000 volumes in print
and an assortment of 140 newspapers of all kinds. Rath Museum, founded by General of that name,
contains a remarkable collection of sculptures and paintings, ancient and modern. The college
or university is worthy of all esteem. Geneva, being so small, it has also: an astronomical observatory,
a conservatory of music, several high schools, an array, an excellent machine hydraulic works in the
Rhone to the service of the city, and many establishments primary education, charity, credit
and economy. The Canton has the merit of having in primary schools than 7,000 students receiving
elementary instruction annually.

[7] For example, a manuscript of Cicero, lit, the homilies of San Agustin, written in the sixth
century, and some volumes of autograph letters, sermons and Calvin's manuscripts.

As was natural, nothing caught my attention both in Geneva and the houses of correction or penalty.
The death penalty is abolished there for many years, and Geneva is perhaps the second European state
that has adopted the prison system of the United States. Although there are some differences
between the two prisons in Geneva, its system of administration is based on the principles of
criminal legislation philosophical isolation, work, surveillance, the economy and the stimulus given
to the amendment of the offender, rehearse describe, the observations
that I could do on a visit to each establishment.

The House of Detention has a double purpose: it's prison for women, whose seclusion can last
for many years, depending on the seriousness of the offense, and
it is a simple correction for men who, from the age of ten, are sentenced
to detention cell until for one year for crimes, if they are elderly,
or crimes, if the accused is a minor.

Time was, perhaps, when seeing her thus he might have taken her hand.

"But don't look as if you already regretted making the promise," she went on to protest. "I
assure you it won't hurt a bit; not any more than having your hair cut. By the way, why do
you wear your hair so short? Oughtn't a poet to have long, noble locks? They come out very
effectively in clay, those long, noble locks. I hope I'm not making your bed too hard. Come
now, Morgan, are you still so heavy-hearted? What can I do to make you merry?"

"Take supper with me," he responded quickly, with an atoning flash of briskness, the while
he upbraided himself for oppressing her with his dejection. "It will be a real Bohemian supper."

"How nice! I'm dying with hunger."

"In here, I mean," he explained. "I make my own supper."

"I know. We heard all about the inside of that cupboard."

"You won't mind sitting on the hard chair?"

"No. What's the menu?"

"Bread and cheese and----"

"Not beer, I hope," she interrupted hastily.

"And cocoa," he finished. "Do you mind keeping house here for two minutes whilst I run down
to get the milk. We have a dairy two doors away."

He returned in a moment and she helped him to set out the table, for which there was no cloth.

"This chair is hard," she said again later, when she had been seated on it some little time.
"I must send you a soft chair, Morgan. I haven't given you a birthday present this year."

"Indeed, you must not. Such luxuries are out of place here, and you ought not to try to spoil me."

"But, dear Morgan, you've a lovely rug, and I'm sure you ought to have a nice chair to keep
it company. You've your guests to think of now. I must have something to sit on when I come
and so must your papa. I'm willing to admit my suggestion was not quite a disinterested one;
in fact, I'm prepared to be perfectly unscrupulous so long as I carry my point."

"I'd better yield before you get so far as that. Only, of course, the chair shall be used exclusively
for my visitors."

"Oh, you must sit on it sometimes, as well."

"Well, let us not quarrel about it."

"Of course we're not going to quarrel about it. We're going to be the best of friends now,
aren't we?"

"I never dared dream----" he began.

"Dreaming hasn't anything to do with it. It really isn't at all necessary, so the omission
need not count. All along I've had the feeling as if you were thrusting me back away from your
life, and I have always wanted to count for something in it, if ever so little. Won't you let
me now be of some help to you? This string is the end of the rough and rugged mountain system of the
former provinces of Chablais and Faucigny, between the valley of
the Arve and Lake Leman.

To the west, the inclined planes, their narrow valleys, hills, steep slopes and finally the towering
hills are happening in beautiful amphitheaters and choppy from the waves of the lake just highlights
of the Jura ridges. All that landscape topo-orographic effect is wonderful, in contrast, or
rather, matching the lake, as if the background is the long narrow blue surface, but holds
above the belt of vineyards, cheerful orchards, farms and capricious funny sowings multicolored sash
framed up just under dark, superbly majestic high Jurassic vegetation (forests of pine and spruce)
and rocks of limestone composition to star in some peaks. Finally, north swell, from irregular
contour lines, light waves, wonderfully transparent blue of the lake, sometimes violently shaken by the
hurricanes that blow in the Alps, some asleep and muttering, groaning under the keel often some steam
or brigantine, immobile like a huge mirror which reflects the splendor of the blue sky and endless
abyss. And these waves, which is always taken away or intrigued, they will stop at the picturesque
setting of the banks and hills of the canton of Vaud, ground wave of gleaming vegetables. Geneva
or Lake Leman is, without doubt, the most beautiful and useful of
which contains Switzerland, rivaled only by the Constance under the
commercial point of view.

Taking the whole shape of an arc or crescent, the ends bent to E. and
S. O. are in Villanueva (Villeneuve) and Geneva, ie towards the entrance
and exit of the Rhone river's banks were closely Ivoire (Savoy setentrional)
and the line that determines the long and narrow small gulf.

The top is called the "great lake", the lower the "little lake" or the Geneva itself. Its greatest length
is 71 kilometers and maximum width of 14 to 4 km between Evian (port and small town of Savoy) and
Morges, Vaud canton villa, containing a total area of ââ1.430 square kilometers. The depth
varies greatly, it comes in the middle of the lake to 350 meters (prodigious in a lake nearby
mountains but which are low in general), while among Geneva Nion and never exceeds 97 meters.
Around the lake abounds in fish (30 species) and birds much more numerous species, offering lucrative
occupation of fishing to many people. The waters are turquoise blue admirable, perhaps unparalleled,
and this transparency is reached to the bottom clearly visible to many meters deep. This enormous
depth, unique phenomena of the internal currents and the action of
the opposing winds that dominate the lake, preventing its waters never
freeze, even in the most rigorous winters, except at the edges, where
they accumulate frost.

There is no report that the total freezing occurred only twice in the eighth and ninth centuries.
The storms of the lake are terrible and sometimes fatal, but the
phenomena of calm and violence, flood and decreases in volume, occur
and occur extremely quickly.

Forty-two rivers flowing into the banks of Lake Geneva, soft side setentrional sandy, rocky, steep
and heavily steep side of Savoy. Of these the most considerable rivers are the RhÃ´ne, of course,
that alone amounts to as many others, and Dranzer (not to be confused with the Dranzer tributary
of the Rhone), river after the rough ride Alps Mountains, flows between Thonon and Evian. The
same RhÃ´ne is the only outlet of the lake, running away as a wide ribbon lazuli, at the height
of 368 meters above sea level, across from Geneva, of which circumstance
derives its name from the city, according to the etymology Celtic
gin , output, and v, rio.

It's so huge mass of granite and limestone sand and silt that accumulates
in the Leman Rhone, towards entry and exit, which every day grow dangerous
banks near Geneva, and the waters recede from Villanueva, emerging
alluvial plain at the top, while the waves invade the shore setentrional
or the canton of Vaud.

It is curious to contrast the upper and lower RhÃ´ne: the first, throwing on their overflowing
lake basin sludge ash, the second purified out of the lake and clear, as if to symbolize the purity
of morals and clarity of the free institutions of Geneva and Vaud. This circumstance, which also shows in
other lakes, like those of Brienz and Thun, is explained by the existence, at bottom, a purifying
substance and reactive dye that works as powerful.


"Dear Margaret," he said, "please don't try and press that on me. It won't help me in the least,
as you see yourself. Besides, what need have we of a symbol? I want you to believe in the new
footing just as much without it. And then," he added, in a gayer note, "there is another reason
why I can't allow you to have such ideas. Heroines always do that sort of thing, and it's quite
too conventional for you."

She laughed and did not persist, though she had coloured still more. And just then she bethought
herself of the hour and drew forth her tiny watch.

"This is being wicked with a vengeance!" she exclaimed. "I really must be going back."

"You must let me come with you, else I shall be nervous all night and my hair may be grey by
the morning."

"Part of the excitement of the adventure was to come alone and to go alone. But as I can't
have your hair turning grey----"

"Do they know at home where you were going?" he asked, as he helped her on with her jacket.

"I didn't tell them, but I dare say they'll guess, and I mean to let them know anyway. I'm
going to leave you these," and she unfastened the bunch of forget-me-nots and put them on the
table.

He saw her to her own door; it was long since he had set foot in Wimpole street. She gave him
a long comrade's hand-clasp, saying: "We had a charming Bohemian supper. You have made me happier
to-night than I have been for years."

He turned away as she rang the bell and he walked all the way back to Southwark. Now that he
had taken her into his life at last, he seemed to have unburdened himself of some overwhelming
weight. Margaret knew everything at last, understood everything, and loved him through all.
His self-distrust had made him keep himself hidden from the Medhursts, but she had helped him
to find and know his own strength. She was right. He was strong enough to accept her friendship.

Though he would have to be at his desk at the usual hour in the morning, he could not go to
bed at once. The flowers she had left seemed to fill the room with sweetness. And something
of lightness and fragrance seemed to remain with him, to be flitting here and there with the
silence of a phantom, to be hovering in the air, to be bending over him, to be nestling close
to him. Then, as he closed his eyes dreamily, Margaret seemed to float before him. He was aware
of her eyes, her hair, her voice; he saw her just as she had sat there with her face and hands
showing exquisite against the silver-blue of her dress, and the forget-me-nots at her throat
and waist.

CHAPTER VIII.

In the autumn of the third year of Morgan's engagement with the Upper Thames street firm of
printers he found himself with enough money to pay off the balance due to his one remaining
creditor. In
fact, police in Geneva is the work of citizens, and it is they who, guided the common interest
of freedom and honor of the state, maintain the most perfect order, in harmony with the most
complete personal liberty as may be innocent and logical. In all public places in Geneva is
a table or cartulon with this caption: "While public trips destined to the usefulness and pleasure
of all, the Administrative Council (The city) put them under the protection of citizens. "There
is in these words admirable simplicity, of which the Genevans are very worthy, a theory teaching
or deep and universal moral and political, economic and social legislation and historical philosophy.

If
the Geneva Village ethnography explains the predominance in him and in all its manifestations
literature, French language, his political genius, industrial and
social institutions correspond to a curious amalgam of different elements.

European migrations of people superiors, attracted to Geneva by the freedom that the Republic guarantees
in times of universal despotism (but the old distinction of five classes of Geneva) have With
it the blood and genius of other peoples, so that the names abound German, Italian, English and
even Spanish, and the types of different races, more or less confused. This gives a remarkable
Ginevra cosmopolitan character. Nowhere is there more so obvious that the phenomenon of social
physiology - so prevalent in the world and almost HOWEVER long forgotten by history - the moral transformation
of a race almost solely by virtue their institutions.

City at one time reduced by the needs of defense, the insulation material within its ramparts and
fortresses, Geneva has become cosmopolitan then - all shelter idea of ​​every man proscribed and
persecuted - welcoming all the good of civilization, practicing resolutely
democracy, penetrating all spheres of intellectual activity going
to look up in the New World, the modern formula of penal philosophy.

Essentially Race French by origin, language and traditions, the people have the qualities
Geneva without the shortcomings of French genius. It has the spirit of research, analytical simultaneously
and generalizing the trend cosmopolitan aspirations, feeling artistic, literary and generous to a large
extent, and not a little of that cheerfulness expansive and elastic, this power assimilation, which
distinguishes the French.
 The parties were married
barely three years back and the wedding was much discussed at the time. It is rumoured that
facts of a strange and sensational character are likely to come to light at the trial, and
the occasion will not be the first one on which the petitioner has figured in the same Court.'"

She passed him the paper--it was a gossippy society weekly--and he read the paragraph again.
For a moment quick vague flashes seemed to rise in his brain as from a vain attempt to strike
a flint; then light came to him.

"Ingram and Cleo," he cried. "She went back to him!"

"Precisely," smiled Helen. "You will remember my lamenting I could not be the good fairy of
your life, because things were already destined to work themselves out for your happiness.
You see now I was a true prophet."

But a sort of dizziness came to him on account of his stumbling efforts to think, to trace
the significance of things.

"Don't faint, please. I'm only a helpless woman, and I'm sure I couldn't rise to the occasion.
Perhaps I've been too precipitate. I've made you swallow the whole stuffed goose at once."

"I'm not so sure that my personal life is going to be affected by it," he began.

"Stuff and nonsense!" she cried. "Your proceedings will be reduced to the utmost simplicity.
There will be no defence at all. I have been, watching affairs patiently for three years now,
and what has happened was bound to come. Do you know who sent your Cleo those bank-notes she
had at Dover? Do you know where she went directly after leaving you? There is a certain house
in Hampstead you know quite well. It has a room in it with a fountain, and really pretty hanging
lamps, and peacocks on the windows. Well, she immediately took repossession of it. And very
glad her rightful lord and master was to have her back again! The distraction of his affections
by the engrossing interest of ambitious matrimonial schemes had been only temporary. As for
his wife--well, about the living one should be silent unless one has something nice to say.
Therefore I'll say nothing about her. Before long, Morgan, you'll be a free man, and a certain
chapter of your life will be erased. Fox & Kraft are an excellent firm of solicitors--almost
a pity to employ such steam-hammers to crack such a very simple nut." Only one case of evasion has happened so far, and that the negligence of a guard.
Inmate never lost any reason not attack the guards. The total confinement without work or
light, and temporary food deprivation or bed to sleep on, are the means of coercion or repression.
The work of prisoners is to make shoes and mats or a pillar grains. Each of the joint workshops
is monitored internally by a guard to win, besides the food and accommodation, three francs a
day. The director, an assistant or secretary, and these guards are the only active employees
of the establishment, and serve him very well. Chaplains attend Sunday church services to make moral and
without prejudice to its competition accidental.

When an inmate is worthy of consideration, is allowed to receive from time to time the short visit
of some debt. This takes place in a booth, the gate through a thin wire that allows the conversation
and the exchange of glances, under the supervision of the warden present, but that prevents all
contact and communication cards, money, weapons. They take books that are carefully recorded
all the facts of the domestic economy and statistical observations on the morality of prisoners. According
to these documents, if the conduct of a defendant is blameless get a less rigorous treatment
and a reduction of sentence, which reaches halfway. These discounts are common. As the product
of labor, the system is analogous to the House of Detention, but part is intended to help,
if they are poor, to the children, parents, or spouse of the inmate. The prison serves only
to those convicted for crimes or serious offenses, to more than one year of confinement cell.
The maximum of the duration is 20 years, applied only in cases of
repeated serious crimes.

The
thing that caught my attention in the prison was the chapel, local extremely simple, unadorned and
provided no seats in the amphitheater.

There the prisoners are divided into sections according to their criminality. At the bottom, next
to the modest chair of the chaplain, is a small altar reduced to one Christ, the image of the
Virgin and the vessels and objects necessary for the Roman worship. This altar is provided with
a thick, dark curtains. When inmates are Roman Catholic chapel, the altar is naked and does the
priest concerned. When his turn assist the Protestants, the altar is covered and is not in sight but
the Bible on the table. Thus, the same pulpit and serve the local priest and pastor. Never in my life
had found a social spectacle as sublime as that of the humble chapel, also dedicated to the service
of two religious communions which have bloodied the soil with their impious struggles. What profound
teaching of spiritualism in religion, of noble simplicity in worship, brotherhood and tolerance,
universality in the religious idea, - without considering the differences in symbols and forms, - of
true Christianity, in order ! Teaching hidden in the depths of a prison, - a symbol of the equal duty
to conscience and justice - to instill the culprit the notion of brotherhood in God and man,
the equal right of all, as violation is precisely what is called
a fault, offense or crime!

By
leaving to Geneva, had not only an impression of deep respect for this small country of philosophers,
artists and free and industrious, but also a kind of comfort and confidence in the future of humanity.
What's great examples and inspirations towering European civilization owes to this tiny village,
used to manufacture watches and exercising free inquiry, his genius
seems to have severe regularity and timing of expansion independent of
the organizations free!

There have been born, to the glory of letters and sciences of every kind, daring naturalists and patients
as Saussure and Candolle, lawyers and Burlamaqui; historians as Sismondi and Mallet, economists
such as John B. Say and Sismondi himself, men of state as Necker, writers such as Madame Necker,
and Cherbuliez TÃ¶pffer; distinguished artists, thinkers, philosophers
like Rousseau immortal!

A huge open carriage, divided into three compartments and containing about 23 people, besides
baggage, was to guide us along the Arve Valley to Chamonix, at the foot of the colossal group
of mountains in the center of which holds the impressive dome of
Mont Blanc. The essentials
are the same for all ranks, and it is on those that personal happiness depends. Up to the age
of twenty-five even a clever girl may delude herself into thinking that the hearty fun and
enjoyment she may be extracting from her circumstances and her position in the world are really
what make happiness, but if she have real brains, a clear vision and quick sympathies, she
will inevitably stifle in her atmosphere of mere pleasure. She will not continue to set store
on her material advantages, on the stage accessories by which she may be surrounded. She will
long for something else--and most often not get it. If I had only been penniless and had loved
and married a man who had all his fighting to do yet! I should have lived beside him, conscious
of being helpful, of being valued for what my companionship meant to him, with a sense of my
dignity and worth as a human being. Instead, I was born rich, I married a man who had no fighting
to do, and so I was a mere mate to him. I was but a child and there was no one to warn me.
Everybody about me was stupid, enslaved to ideas that are rotten at the core! We dangle baubles
before our children and poison the fresh, pure fount of humanity. Thus it is I have been a
waste and useless force in the world. If it had only been decreed to me to have children of
my own, I feel sure I should have been a better woman than I am."

Her voice died away in a strange sweet murmur. In her face there came a look as of holy meditation;
her eyes shone with a light of yearning.

"I am tired of England," she resumed in a moment. "I shall be going away before long. I want
to find some secluded spot near a lovely Italian lake, where I may stay and rest indefinitely.
Perhaps for years, for I am very tired. I shall wait till I see your happiness completed, Morgan,
even though this may be our last meeting. Till then I dare not go; you are not to be trusted
to take the happiness that is within your grasp. You know I claim to be a connoisseur of women,
and I am perfectly satisfied that you shall marry your Margaret. That is the highest compliment
I could pay her. There is that indefinable, unseizable something in her face which reveals
the whole personality, and it won me immediately. We have met three or four times now, but,
of course, I do not figure sufficiently in her consciousness that she should mention me specially
to you. Citizens know that the power
rests in their hands, and in his opinion, the press has the most noteworthy activity and range
to serve all his interests. Boards and corporations of all kinds
are too numerous and frequent. You know I have a weakness for
mysticism, and I like to think of myself as a sort of phantom that just accompanied you on
your way a little and perhaps helped you a little at a critical moment and then disappeared.
So promise me Margaret shall never, never know."

"She knows everything but that," he replied. "It hurts me to make the promise, but I understand
why you wish me to. Besides, I must look on this one reservation from her as the penalty--the
lingering symbol of the past. But there is now one thing I should like to mention, Helen, and
that is, I want to recur to that money, the five hundred pounds I borrowed of you. You see
I have tasted blood."

"When you feel you can spare the money, dear Morgan, I should wish you to do some good work
with it. Seek out those who may need it--a struggling student, a starving poet, a brave orphaned
boy or girl toiling to support the younger children. Save some human being from despair, and
restore his faith and hope. 

(2) The first ship, with the glorious name of William Tell was launch In Geneva in 1823. The date
is significant.

The Republic of Geneva,which for centuries was limited to the city of that name,increased in 1816,because
of the treaties of Vienna and Paris that annexed fifteen Saboyardos districts and six French.The
canton's population has increased to 83,345 inhabitants of which more than 9,000 are citizens of other
States of the Confederation,and about 12,000 foreigners -French today in majority.The capital alone
has 41,415 inhabitants,making Geneva first city in Confederation.Although inside the State two-thirds
of the inhabitants profess reformed religion or ritual called a Calvinist, and the Roman Catholics
make up,along with 1.000 Jews,the other third,in the capital,the majority of the reformed are not in
the same proportion.For the rest,even though you hear it in conversations in every instance German-Swiss,Italian,
English accents (by the abundance of travelers),and even the Romans themselves, the dialect spoken
in the GraubÃ¼nden, French is the official and common languaje to
all people.

Geneva has had a history as stormy and difficult as fruitful, suffering, like all peoples of the
race of the Allobroges, invasions and subsequent domination of the Romans, Barbarians of the V
century, the BurguiÃ±ones, Ostrogoths and Franks, the Swiss and Savoyards
themselves and lately the French Republicans in 1798. So I was when I woke up, and I didn't eat any breakfast.
And now the fresh air makes me as hungry as a hunter. Do get me something nice, please."
