Women of Quality and Fashion will perhaps think themselves no ways liable to any of these Mischances;
but I shall convince them, that howsoever secure they may imagine themselves to be from them
by their Coaches and Chairs, and other Accommodations, they are yet to be come at by some People
they are not well aware of. There are few Women of any Fashion, that make a tolerable Figure
in the Beau Monde, but what have a continual clatter of Manteaumakers, Milliners, and Sempstresses
about their Ears; besides Tire-Women, and Fortune-Tellers by Coffee-Grounds; together with
a Train of Chamber-maids, and old Housekeepers, who have got married, and are permitted to
visit the Families they once lived in. These, with a Croud of Midwives, Twelve-penny Lottery-Women,
and other How d'ye do People, are for ever plaguing them with this new Fancy and Pattern, and
recommending such and such Persons to their Custom for Teas, China, and Trumpery. And while
a Story is telling of who's a going to be Married, who is brought to Bed, or who has Miscarried,
down goes the Cup and Saucer, and the Tea all over her Ladyship's Petticoat; then do they curse
their unlucky Hands, and beg ten thousand Pardons for the Mischance; and threaten to go to
India, but they will match the Set, so as not to be distinguish'd by the nicest Judgment. The
whole Suit of Clothes, perhaps, becomes the Perquisite of my Lady's Woman, and the Set of China
is not to be match'd in the Kingdom. The Dealers soon get Intelligence of the Accident, from
the Person by whose Hands it was done; and the Lady is teaz'd almost to death with People shewing
her new Sets, new Patterns, and what not: and as soon as she has purchased, the Gossip, by
whose dextrous Management the Traffick was brought about, not only begs and gets the damaged
Set of China for herself, but moreover receives a Moiety out of the Shopkeeper's Profit who
sold the new Set; as well as Poundage from the Mercer, for what he shall sell the Lady. I knew
a Woman of Quality who was so strangely pester'd with this kind of Visitants, that she could
never keep a clean Manteau to her Tail, nor a complete Set of China to her Tea-Table; and yet
continued so incredulous, as not to be persuaded that there was any Art and Design in the Disasters
that so frequently happen'd to her.

How many great Ladies have had their Gown-Tails cut from their Backsides at Balls and Operas,
not so much for the sake of what Profit could be made of them, as has been apparent, but for
the promoting of Trade and Commerce; and have return'd home in Jackets, like Dutch Burgomasters
Wives, to their Families?

The Methods made use of to Gripe, Surfeit, Cholick, and otherwise disorder the Bodies of Children,
as well as Persons of riper Years, in order to render them due Objects of Advice and Physick,
I believe are obvious enough to every ingenious Person who is conversant with Families, and
the Streets of London. What Person is there, of common Humanity amongst us, but must look with
the utmost Grief and Concern upon that intolerable number of Wheel-barrows, Stands, and Benches,
which are so industriously ranged and disposed thro' all the Streets, Lanes, and Alleys of
the Town, retailing various Kinds of damaged and unwholesome Fruits to the Passengers? all
which manifestly tend to destroy the Healths of those who are weak enough to purchase them,
and oftentimes are the Cause of epidemical Diseases.

I hope none of my Readers will be so uncharitable as to suggest that there is a Combination
amongst Quacks, Apothecaries or Druggists; for furnishing these moving Shopkeepers with Barrows,
Baskets, Money to purchase unwholesome Fruit, or any other Necessaries and Conveniences for
carrying on this dangerous Traffick with the middling People: but thus much must be said, that
we generally find them posted at, or near the Doors and Shops of those Traders. And then, what
a horrible Squall and Outcry is there, according to the Season, of Green Goosberries by the
Gallon, Cherries by the Pound, Plumbs by the Hat-full, Cucumbers by the Dozen, and rare lumping
Half-penny-worths of Pears, Pippins, and Pearmains, &c. The People are constantly complaining
of Disorders they produce, but cannot refrain from them, because they are, as it were, thrust
down their Throats in this manner; and when Advice is had, the Patient is rarely told that
his Malady proceeded from the real Cause, but that Fruit is held to be good and cooling to
the Blood at all Times and Seasons, and by all Countries and Constitutions. Thus the Patient
repeats his Poison, the Prescriber his Fees, and the Apothecary his Potion. I once catch'd
an Apothecary at the side of a Wheel-barrow enquiring of a dirty Hussey what Quantities of
Goods she had disposed of for a Day or two; doubtless that he might thereby proportion the
Quantity of his Medicines suitable to the Execution her Trash must have done amongst his Neighbours.

Another time I saw a Physician vouchsafe to descend from his Chariot to become an Advocate
in the open Street for a Flat-Cap Retailer of Golden Rennets, who had caus'd a great Riot at
a Door she was permitted to place her Barrow against, and pleaded as strenuously for her Continuance
at it, as a Barrister would have done for a Fee of five Guineas; urging, among other Reasons,
the Cruelty, and what an unchristian Action it would be in any one to obstruct a poor Wretch
in procuring a small Livelihood in an honest industrious Way. This Argument had the more Weight
with the People, because every one was surprized to hear so humane a Sentiment from a Practitioner
in Physick.

Some Shopkeepers Wives being got together at a Merry-making, an Apothecary's Mortar-piece of
the Company was complaining of the bad Situation her Husband's Affairs would have been in,
if that it had not pleased G--d the Apricots, Plumbs and Nectarins had turned out vastly bad
and plentiful this Year. 

Monkeys are about, there is no it, or was often bestow like men; and, what is worse, force are there
in monkeys. The people, s have an respect for what they choose for call'or has been an Occasion,

Yet he is but this afternoon.
 My Lady sees no Company, forbears
Plays and Operas, and every Room of the House looks as if a pestilential Distemper was raging
in the Family.

Towards the close of the Evening, a Fellow in a Soldier's Coat, with the Dog very carefully
wrapp'd up in one of the Lappets, is knocking at the Door. A Reprieve to a Malefactor the Morning
of Execution, or the News of a rich Father's Death to an extravagant Heir, cannot be more welcome
than two or three Yelps of the absent Animal shall be to all the Servants: Happy is that Servant
who has the good fortune first to carry the glad Tidings to my Lady. The Fellow tells a long
Story of his being at his Post in St. James's Park, and of his seeing the Dog under a Woman's
Arm; and how he suspected her coming honestly by it, and what Fatigues and Difficulties he
met with in wresting the poor Creature from her: How the Mob took part against him, and the
risque he run of being sent to the Savoy; with twenty other Falsehoods, all which are greedily
swallowed: Every Face, with Tears of Joy, standing with great Faith and Patience to hear his
impudent Narration of the great Dangers that the poor little Creature and himself had escaped.
The Thief receives the Reward, with perhaps a Guinea over, and goes away loaded with Applauses
and Blessings, for restoring Peace and Tranquillity in the Family.

The Dogs that belong to private Families, and Shopkeepers, the proper time for setting them
is generally soon after Seven in the Morning, when the Maid neglects her Entry and the Stairs
for a Conversation with the Baker's Journeyman, or her Master's Prentice; and a general Tête-a-Tête
of all the Mops and Brooms in the Neighbourhood is going forward; and a Sash Window, or a Street
Door left carelesly open, whereby an opportunity is given for Tray to be trick'd out of House
and Home by a bit of Meat, that is generally shewn him as a Bait for that purpose. Half a Guinea
for bringing him home is repeated three or four times in the Advertisements, and then a Guinea
once or twice more; so that about Forty Shillings must be expended, before the poor Fool shall
be put into statu quo.

In the Evening, when the Ladies are going to make their Visits, their pretty Favourites are
too apt to follow them from the Parlour to the Street Door; and if their Guardians and Trustees
are not sufficiently upon the watch, a Person under pretence of wanting Alms, shall not only
mump Money, but carry off their Ward into the bargain.

When Service is over at the Churches and Meeting-Houses on a Sunday, we find a great many Hands
at work plying the Doors and Avenues; in hopes of picking up now and then one of these straggling
Gentry: For there are very staunch Church-Folks, as well as rigid Presbyterians of this Species;
and I have seen some of them, whose Zeal has transported them so far, as to render themselves
liable to the Penalty of Twenty Pounds, in disturbing a Preacher by loudly snarling at him,
when they have been pleased not to approve of his Countenance or Doctrine.

The Quakers may entertain a great many of them at their Habitations, but I believe, have few
or none that can be truly said to be of their Persuasion; for I could never learn that any
were ever affected with their Principles, and much less frequented their Places of Religious
Worship.

Those honest City-Tradesmen and others, who so lovingly carry their Wives and Mistresses to
the neighbouring Villages in Chaises to regale them on a Sunday, are seldom sensible of the
great Inconveniences and Dangers they are exposed to: for besides the common Accidents of the
Road, there are a Set of regular Rogues kept constantly in Pay to incommode them in their Passage;
and these are the Drivers of what are called Waiting Jobbs, and other Hackney Travelling-Coaches
with Sets of Horses, who are commissioned by their Masters to annoy, sink, and destroy all
the single and double Horse-Chaises they can conveniently meet with, or overtake in their Way,
without regard to the Lives or Limbs of the Persons who travel in them. What Havock these industrious
Sons of Blood and Wounds have made within twenty Miles of London in the Compass of a Summer's
Season, is best known by the Articles of Accidents in the common News-Papers: The miserable
Shrieks of Women and Children not being sufficient to deter the Villains from doing what they
call their Duty to their Masters; for besides their Daily or Weekly Wages, they have an extraordinary
stated Allowance for every Chaise they can reverse, ditch, or bring by the Road, as the Term
or Phrase is.

I heard a Fellow, who drove a hired Coach and four Horses, give a long Detail of a hard Chace
he gave last Summer to a Two-Horse Chaise, which was going with a Gentleman and three Ladies
to Windsor. He said he first came in view of the Chaise at Knights-Bridge, and there put on
hard after it to Kensington; but that being drawn by a Pair of good Cattle, and the Gentleman
in the Seat pretty expert at driving, they made the Town before him; and there stopping at
a Tavern-Door to take a Glass of Wine, he halted also, and whistled for his Horses to stale:
but the Chaise not yet coming on, he affected another Delay, by pretending that one of his
Horses had taken up a Stone, and so dismounting, as if to search, lay by, till the Enemy had
passed him; that then they kept a Trot on together to Turnham-Green, when the People suspecting
his Design again, put on: that he then whipp'd after them for dear Blood, thinking to have
done their Business between that Place and Brentford. But here he was again disappointed, for
the two Horses still kept their Courage, till they came between Longford and Colnbrook, where
he plainly perceived 'em begin to droop or knock up, and found he had then a sure Game on't.
He went on leisurely after them, till both Parties came into a narrow Lane, where there was
no Possibility of an Escape, when he gave his Horses a sudden Jerk, and came with such Violence
upon the People, that he pull'd their Machine quite over. He said, the Cries of the Women were
so loud that the B--ches might be heard to his Master's Yard in Piccadilly; that there being
no-body near to assist the People, he got clear off with two or three blind old Women his Passengers
some Miles beyond Maidenhead, safe both from Pursuit and Evidence.

I have been credibly informed, that many of the Coachmen and Postillions belonging to the Quality
are seduced by the Masters of the Travelling-Coaches to involve themselves in the Guilt of
this monstrous Enormity, and have certain Fees for dismounting Persons on single Horses, and
over-turning Chaises, when it shall suit with their Convenience to do it with Safety, (that
is, within the Verge of the Law;) and in case of an Action or Indictment, if the Master or
Mistress will not stand by their Servant, and believe the Mischief was merely accidental, the
Offender is then defended by a general Contribution from all the Stage-Coach Masters within
the Bills of Mortality.

Those Hackney-Gentlemen who drive about the City and Suburbs of London, have by their over-grown
Insolence obliged the Government to take notice of them, and make Laws for their Regulation;
and as there are Commissioners for receiving the Tax they pay to the Publick, so those Commissioners
have Power to hear and determine between the Drivers and their Passengers upon any Abuse that
happens: and yet these ordinary Coachmen abate very little of their abusive Conduct, but not
only impose in Price upon those that hire them, but refuse to go this or that way as they are
call'd: whereas the Law obliges them to go wherever they are legally required, and at reasonable
Hours. This Treatment, and the particular saucy impudent Behaviour of the Coachmen in demanding
t'other Twelver or Tester above their Fare, has been the occasion of innumerable Quarrels,
Fighting and Abuses; affronting Gentlemen; frighting and insulting Women; and such Rudenesses,
that no civil Government will, or indeed ought to suffer; and above all, has been the occasion
of the killing several Coachmen by Gentlemen that have been provoked by the villainous Tongues
of those Fellows beyond the Extent of their Patience. Their intolerable Behaviour has rendered
them so contemptible and odious in the Eyes of all Degrees of People whatever, that there is
more Joy seen for one Hackney-Coachman's going to the Gallows, than for a Dozen Highway-men
and Street-Robbers.

The Driver of a Hackney-Coach having the Misfortune to break a Leg and an Arm by a Fall from
his Box, was rendred incapable of following that Business any longer; and therefore posted
himself at the Corner of one of the principal Avenues leading to Covent-Garden with his Limbs
bound up to the most advantageous Manner to move the Passengers to Commiseration. He told his
deplorable Case to all, but all passed without Pity; and the Man must have inevitably perish'd,
had it not come into his head to shift the Scene and his Situation. The Transition was easy,
he whipt on a Leathern-Apron, and from a Coachman became a poor Joiner, with a Wife and four
Children, that had broke his Limbs by a Fall from the Top of a House. Showers of Copper poured
daily into his Hat, and in a few Years he became able to purchase many Figures, as well as
Horses; and he is now Master of one of the most considerable Livery-Stables in London.

The next are the Watermen; and indeed the Insolence of these, though they are under some Limitations
too, is yet such at this time, that it stands in greater need than any other of severe Laws,
and those Laws being put in speedy execution. A few Months ago, one of these very People being
Steers-man of a Passage-Boat between Queenhithe and Windsor, drowned fifteen People at one
time; and when many of them begg'd of him to put them on Shore, or take down his Sails, he
impudently mock'd them, ask'd some of the poor frighted Women, if they were afraid of going
to the Devil; and bid them say their Prayers: then used a vulgar Water-Phrase which such Fellows
have in their Mouths, Blow Devil, the more Wind the better Boat. A Man of a very considerable
Substance perishing with the rest of the unfortunate Passengers, this Villain, who had saved
himself by swimming, had the surprizing Impudence to go the next Morning to his Widow, who
lived at Kingston upon Thames. The poor Woman, surrounded with a number of sorrowful Friends,
was astonished to think what could be the occasion of the Fellow's coming to her; but thinking
he was come to give some Account of her Husband's Body being found, at last she condescended
to see him. After a scurvy Scrape or two, the Monster very modestly hoped his good Mistress
would give him half a Crown to drink her Health, by way of Satisfaction for a Pair of Oars
and a Sail he had lost the Night before, when he had drowned her Husband.

The Sums which are expended daily by this Method, are realy surprizing. I knew a Clerk to a
Vestry, a Half-pay Officer, a Chancery Sollicitor, and a broken Apothecary, that made a tolerable
good Livelihood, by calling into a Tavern all their Friends that passed by the Window in this
manner. Their Custom was to sit with a Quart of White-Port before them in a Morning; every
Person they decoy'd into their Company for a Minute or two, never threw down less than his
Six-pence, and few drank more than one Gill; and if two or three Glasses, he seldom came off
with less than one Shilling. The Master of the House constantly provided them with a plain
Dinner, gratis. All Dinner-time they kept their Room still, in full view of the Street, and
so sate catching Gudgeons, (as they used to call it) from Morning till Night; when, besides
amply filling their own Carcasses, and discharging the whole Reckoning, they seldom divided
less than seven or eight Shillings a Man per Diem.

Some People, unacquainted with this Fellow-feeling at Taverns, often wonder how such a one
does to hold it; that he spends a confounded deal of Money, is seldom out of a Tavern, and
never in his Business: when, in reality, he is thus never out of his Business, and so helps
to run away with the chief Profits of the House.

Nor are these all the Hardships many of the Vintners lie under; for besides, their Purses must
too often stand a private Examination behind the Bar, when any of these sort of Customers Necessities
shall require it.
