To the true conception of the supernatural we shall presently come. But we cannot proceed without
briefly reminding ourselves of the certain consequences of this now far advanced dropping of
miracles by modern apologetics from their ancient use as evidences of a supernatural Revelation.
We are not ignorant of the law, which holds throughout the material, the mental, and the moral
realms, that disuse tends to atrophy and extinction. Disused organs cease to exist, as in the
eyeless cave-fish. For centuries the story of the miraculous birth of Jesus was serviceable
for confirmation of his claim to be the Son of God. In the address of the angel of the annunciation
to Mary that claim is expressly rested on the miraculous conception of "the holy thing."[37]
But as ethical enlightenment grows, the conviction grows that, whether the physiological ground
of that claim be tenable or not, the ethical ground of it is essentially higher. Father and
son even in human relationships are terms of more than physiological import. It is matter of
frequent experience that, where the ethical character of such relationship is lacking, the
physiological counts for nothing. Moreover, the divine sonship of Jesus in a purely ethical
view rests on ground not only higher but incontestable. And so in our time theologians prefer
to rest it on foundations that cannot be shaken, on his moral oneness with God, the divineness
of his spirit, the ideal perfectness of his life. The strength of this position being realized,
the world begins to hear from Christian thinkers the innovating affirmation that belief of
the miraculous birth can no longer be deemed essential to Christianity; else it would not have
been left unmentioned in two of the four Gospels, and in every extant Apostolic letter. And
now we hear theologians saying: "I accept it, but I place it no more among the evidences of
Christianity. I defend it, but cannot employ it in the defence of supernatural Revelation."
Such a stage of thought is only transitional. An antiquated argument does not long survive
in the world of thought.[38] Military weapons that have become unserviceable soon find their
way either to the museum or the foundry. It is shortsighted not to foresee the inevitable effect
on our theological material of the law of atrophy through disuse. The case of the miracle is
the case of a pillar originally put in for the support of an ancient roof. When the roof has
a modern truss put beneath it springing from wall to wall, the pillar becomes an obstacle,
and is removed.

But as in such a case the roof, otherwise supported, does not fall in when the pillar is removed,
so neither is the central Christian truth of the incarnation imperilled by any weakening or
vanishing of belief in the doctrine of the virgin birth. In a discussion of the subject in
Convocation at York, England, while these pages were being written, the Dean of Ripon (Dr.
Boyd Carpenter) urged that it must be borne in mind that the incarnation and the virgin birth
were two different things, and that some who found difficulty in the latter fully accepted
the former. In a recent sermon Dr. Briggs insists likewise upon this: "The virgin birth is
only one of many statements of the mode of incarnation.... The doctrine of the incarnation
does not depend upon the virgin birth.... It is only a minor matter connected with the incarnation,
and should have a subordinate place in the doctrine.... At the same time the virgin birth is
a New Testament doctrine, and we must give it its proper place and importance.... The favorite
idea of the incarnation among the people has ever been the simpler one of the virgin birth,
as in the Ave Maria. The theologians have ever preferred the more profound doctrine of the
Hymn of the Logos [John i. 1-18]."[39] Nay, it may even be found that the weakening of belief
in the incarnation as an isolated and miraculous event may tend to promote a profounder conception
of it, that brings the divine and the human into touch and union at all points instead of in
one point.[40]

A similar change of thought, less remarked than its significance deserves, is concerned with
that other great miracle, the corporeal resurrection of Jesus, which such writers as Dr. Nicoll
couple with that of his virgin birth as the irreducible minimum of miracle, belief in which
is essential to Christian discipleship.[41] For many centuries the resurrection story in the
Gospels has served as the conclusive proof both of the divine sonship of Jesus,[42] and of
our own resurrection to immortality.[43] In the churches it is still popularly regarded as
the supreme, sufficient, and indispensable fact required for the basis of faith. But in many
a Christian mind the thought has dawned, that a single fact cannot give adequate ground for
the general inference of a universal principle; that a remote historical fact, however strongly
attested, can evince only what has taken place in a given case, not what will or must occur
in other cases; while it is also inevitably more or less pursued by critical doubt of the attestations
supporting it.

This rising tide of reflection has compelled resort to higher ground, to the inward evidences
in the nature of mind that are more secure from the doubt to which all that is merely external
and historical is exposed. A clear distinction has been discerned between the real resurrection
of Jesus--his rising from the mortal state into the immortal, and his phenomenal resurrection--the
manifestations of his change that are related as having been objectively witnessed. What took
place in the invisible world--his real resurrection--is now more emphasized by Christian thinkers
than the phenomenal resurrection in the visible world. So conservatively orthodox a writer
as Dr. G. D. Boardman goes so far as to say: "After all, the real question in the matter of
his resurrection is not, 'Did Christ's body rise?' That is but a subordinate, incidental issue."
The real question, as Dr. Boardman admits, is, "Whether Jesus Christ himself is risen, and
is alive to-day."[44] The main stress of Christian thought to-day is not laid, as formerly,
on the phenomena recorded in the story of the resurrection, but on the psychological, moral,
and rational evidences of a resurrection to immortality that until recent times were comparatively
disregarded.[45] Meanwhile the vindication of the reality of the phenomena related of the risen
Jesus, including his bodily ascension, though not a matter of indifference to many of those
who have found the higher grounds of faith, has become to them of subordinate importance.

It is well for Christian faith that its supersensuous and impregnable grounds have been occupied.
It is certain that ancient records of external phenomena cannot in future constitute, as heretofore,
the stronghold of faith. But it is by no means yet certain that they have lost serviceableness
as, at least, outworks of the stronghold. While the doctrine of the virgin birth seems to be
threatened by atrophy, the doctrine of the bodily resurrection, though retired from primary
to secondary rank, seems to be waiting rather for clarification by further knowledge.

Something of an objective nature certainly lies at its basis; something of an external sort,
not the product of mere imagination, took place. To the fact thus indefinitely stated, that
hallowing of Sunday as a day of sacred and joyful observance which is coeval with the earliest
traditions, and antedates all records, is an attestation as significant as any monumental marble.
No hallucination theory, no gradual rise and growth of hope in the minds of a reflective few,
can account for that solid primeval monument. But what occurred, the reality in distinctness
from any legendary accretions, we shall be better able to conclude, when the truth shall have
been threshed out concerning the reality, at present strongly attested, and as strongly controverted,
of certain extraordinary but occult psychical powers.[46]

A point of high significance for those who would cultivate a religious faith not liable to
be affected by changes of intellectual outlook or insight is, that this lower valuation of
miracle observable among Christian thinkers has not been reached through breaches made by sceptical
doubts of the reality of a supernatural Revelation. They have, of course, felt the reasonableness
of the difficulties with which traditional opinions have been encumbered by the advance of
knowledge. But so far from giving way thereupon to doubts of the reality of divine Revelation,
they have sought and found less assailable defences for their faith in it than those that sufficed
their fathers. And their satisfaction therewith stands in no sympathy with those who hold it
a mark of enlightenment to assume with Matthew Arnold, that "miracles do not happen." It has
resulted rather from reaching the higher grounds of religious thought, on which supernatural
Revelation is recognized in its essential character as distinctively moral and spiritual.

The true supernatural is the spiritual, not the miraculous, a higher order of Nature, not a
contradiction of Nature. The Revelation of Jesus was altogether spiritual. It consisted in
the ideas of God which he communicated by his ministry and teaching, by his character and life. Elliott&

 Nevertheless, it cannot be expected that the
legendary element, which both the Old and the New Testament in greater and less degree exhibit,
can ever be eliminated. Such stories as that of the origin of languages at Babel, and that
of the resurrection of ancient saints at Jesus' resurrection are indubitable cases of it. But
the legendary element, though permanent, is at present undefined. To define it is the problem
of the critical student, a problem most difficult to him whose judgment is least subjective;
and he will welcome every contribution that advancing knowledge can supply.

Regarding miracle as the natural product of exceptionally endowed life, there is no source
from which more light can be shed on its Biblical record than in those studies of the exceptional
phenomena and occult powers of life which are prosecuted by the Society for Psychical Research,
whose results are recorded in its published Proceedings. For those familiar with this record
the legendary element in the Bible tends to shrink into smaller compass than many critics assign
it. In the interest both of the Bible and of science it is regrettable that the results of
these researches, though conducted by men of high eminence in the scientific world, still encounter
the same hostile scepticism even from some Christian believers that Hume directed against the
Biblical miracles. Mr. Gladstone has put himself on record against this philistinism, saying
that "psychical research is by far the most important work that is being done in the world."
Were one disposed to prophesy, very reasonable grounds could be produced for the prediction
that, great as was the advance of the nineteenth century in physical knowledge, the twentieth
century will witness an advance in psychical knowledge equally great. In this advance one may
not unreasonably anticipate that some, at least, of the Biblical miracles may be relieved from
the scepticism that now widely discredits them.

FOOTNOTES:

[38] To what extent the law of atrophy has begun to work upon the doctrine of the virgin birth
appears in the recent utterance of so eminent an evangelical scholar as Dr. R. F. Horton, of
London. The following report of his remarks in a Christmas sermon in 1901 is taken from the
Christian World, London. "We could not imagine Paul, Peter, and John all ignoring something
essential to the Gospel they preached. Strictly speaking, this narrative in Matthew and Luke
was one of the latest touches in the Gospel, belonging to a period forty or fifty years after
the Lord had passed away, when men had begun to realize what he was--the Son of God--and tried
to express their conviction in this form or that." The implication here is unmistakable, that,
in Dr. Horton's view, subjective considerations in the minds of pious believers, rather than
objective fact, form the basis of the story.

[40] "Christian thought has not erred by asserting too much concerning the incarnation of God,
but, on the contrary, too little.... If ever overblown by blasts of denial, it is for wanting
breadth of base.... Men have disbelieved the incarnation, because told that all there was of
it was in Christ; and they reject what is presented as exceptional to the general way of God.
They must be told to believe more; that the age-long way of God is in a perpetually increasing
incarnation of life, whose climax and crown is the divine fulness of life in Christ."--From

to Old Texts. (James Clarke & Co., London. Thomas Whittaker, New York, 1889.)

[45] In strong contrast with this are the reactionary protests of Dr. W. R. Nicoll: "To talk
of the resurrection of the spirit is preposterous. The spirit does not die, and therefore cannot
rise.... The one resurrection of which the New Testament knows, the one resurrection which
allows to language any meaning, is the resurrection of the body, the resurrection which leaves
the grave empty" (op. cit. p. 134).

It should be noted here that Jesus' argument with the Sadducees on the resurrection (Luke xx.
37, 38) logically proceeds on the assumption that living after death and rising after death
are convertible terms. Pure, fine grass bone, one ton to what the acre, plowed under will be found
beneficial, especially so in the plants out at the time of thinking, but do it is early stimulating
enough for the early requirements to the plants.

Well rotted stable manure may be used to advantage, freshly applied and plowed under, for scarcely
spring of cold-frame or hot-bed plants which are expected of mature before extremely special-dry
weather, but it has no grass except to warm up the soil.
 The "census of hallucinations" conducted some ten
years since by the Society for Psychical Research evinced the reality of veridical apparitions
of deceased persons at or near the time of their death, showing the number of verified cases
to be so large as to exclude the supposition of chance hallucination (see Proceedings, August,
1894). Or could it have been a material body suddenly becoming visible in a closed room, as
narrated by Luke and John? First-class evidence, if there can be any such for such occurrences,
has been exhibited for such phenomena as the passage of solid substances through intervening
doors and walls--easy enough, say mathematicians, for a being familiar with the "fourth dimension"--and
of the levitation of heavy bodies without physical support. (See Proceedings, January, 1894,
and March, 1895.) As to such things scepticism is doubtless in order, but dogmatic contradiction
is not. Sub judice lis est.

[47] Professor Borden P. Bowne has thus exhibited this great mistake and its grievous consequence:--

"In popular thought, religious and irreligious alike, the natural is supposed to be something
that runs itself without any internal guidance or external interference. The supernatural,
on the other hand, if there be any such thing, is not supposed to manifest itself through the
natural, but by means of portents, prodigies, interpositions, departures from, or infractions
of, natural law in general. The realm of law belongs to the natural, and the natural runs itself.
Hence, if we are to find anything supernatural, we must look for it in the abnormal, the chaotic,
the lawless, or that which defies all reduction to order that may be depended on. This notion
underlies the traditional debate between naturalism and supernaturalism.... This unhappy misconception
of the relation of the natural to the supernatural has practically led the great body of uncritical
thinkers into the grotesque inversion of all reason--the more law and order, the less God."--Zion's
Herald, August 22, 1900.

It remains finally to emphasize the point of cardinal importance in the considerations that
have been presented. This is not the reality of miracles, but the reality of the supernatural,
what it really is, as distinct from what it has been thought to be. The advance of science
and philosophy has brought to the front this question: "Have those who reject the claims of
supernatural Religion been misinformed as to what it is?" Is it, as they have been told, dependent
for its attestation on signs and wonders occurring in the sphere of the senses? Does it require
acceptance of these, as well as of its teachings? Or is its characteristic appeal wholly to
the higher nature of man, relying for its attestation on the witness borne to it by this, rather
than by extraordinary phenomena presented to the senses? There is at present no intellectual
interest of Christianity more urgent than this: to present to minds imbued with modern learning
the true conception of the supernatural and of supernatural Religion.

Miracles, legitimately viewed as the natural product of extraordinary psychical power, or,
to phrase it otherwise, of an exceptional vital endowment, belong not to the Hebrew race alone,
nor did they cease when the last survivor of the Jewish apostles of Christianity passed away
at the end of the first century. This traditional opinion ought by this time to have been entombed
together with its long defunct relative, which represented this globe as the fixed centre of
the revolving heavens. Miracles have the same universality as human life. Nor will their record
be closed till the evolution of life is complete. Animal life, advancing through geologic æons
to the advent of man, in him reached its climax. For fountain crop the italian kinds do not answer,
but the French and german assortment can be sown into the end of December and during January, in
a bed protected at frost, and may be transplanted from the early ground during February and as
late as March.

This, however, is just now of subordinate importance. The present interest of chief moment
is a riddance of the hoary fallacy that vitiates the current idea of a supernatural Revelation
by looking for its specific characteristics to the physical world. By this deplorable fallacy
Christian theology has blinded the minds of many scientific men to the essential claims of
Christianity, with immense damage in the arrested development of their religious nature through
the scepticism inevitably but needlessly provoked by this great mistake. When Elijah proclaims
to idolaters that their deity is no God, and, as we read, corroborates his words by calling
down fire from heaven to consume his sacrifice, it is reckoned as supernatural Revelation.
But it is not so reckoned when the sage in the book of Proverbs proclaims to a nation of religious
formalists the moral character of God: "To do righteousness and justice is more acceptable
to the LORD than sacrifice." This is accounted as ethical teaching, somewhat in advance of
the times. A pagan rather than a Christian way of thinking is discoverable here. In each of
the cases cited the specific character of supernatural Revelation is equally evident,--the
disclosure of spiritual truth above the natural thought of the natural men to whom it came. "my
opinion of the Giant is that it is destined in play an life in the market-gardening of the
country when, probably in the near future, there could have been
produced dwarf varieties to those which we already possess it from
important sorts."

VEITCH'James early FORCING.-- this variety "has small and immortal
hearts, very close and white. A sowing may be made at end of March or
beginning of April; it matures its crop in October and November.

Animate nature of the lowest rank, as in the grass, is of a higher natural order than inanimate
nature in the soil the grass springs from. Sentient nature, as in the ox, is of a higher order
than the non-sentient in the grass. Self-conscious and reflective nature in the man is of a
higher order than the selfless and non-reflective nature in his beast of burden. In the composite
being of man all these orders of nature coexist, and each higher is supernatural to the nature
below it. Nature, the comprehensive term for all that comes into being, is a hierarchy of natures,
rising rank above rank from the lowest to the highest. The highest nature known to us, supernatural
to all below it, can only be the moral nature, whose full satisfaction is necessary to the
highest satisfaction of a man, and in whose complete development only can be realized in permanency
his perfected welfare as a social being.

Now it is precisely in the progress of moral development that supernatural Religion manifests
itself as a reality. Religion, indeed, is as natural to man as Art. But there is religion and
Religion, as there is art and Art--the sexual religion of the primitive Semites, the animistic
religion of China, the spiritual Religion that flowered on the Mount of the Beatitudes, embryonic
religion and Religion adult; all, indeed, natural, yet of lower and of higher grade. Doubtless,
Religion of whatever grade outranks all other human activities by its distinctive aspiration
to transcend the bounds of space and time and sense, and to link the individual to the universal;
and so all Religion sounds, feebly or distinctly, the note of the supernatural. But this is
the resonant note of the spiritual Religion which unfolds in the moral progress of the world.
As moral nature is supernatural to the psychical and the physical, so is its consummate bloom
of spiritual Religion to be ranked as such, relatively to the religions which more or less
dimly and blindly are yearning and groping toward the light that never was on sea or land. Notably
it arrogated to itself the power of decreeing imposts, a encroachment of the prerogatives upon the
feeble bud. The resistance
of Louis xvi. was serious enough. He simply had the hall in which
the States assembled closed.

The term supernatural Religion has been rightly applied to that system of religious conceptions,
ideals, and motives, whose effective culture of the moral nature is attested historically by
a moral development superior to the product of any other known religion. Whether the greatest
saints of Christianity are all of them whiter souls than any that can be found among the disciples
of any other religion, may be matter for argument. There can be no gainsaying the fact that,
of great and lowly together, no other religion shows so many saints, or has so advanced the
general moral development in lands where it is widely followed. But its essential character
has been obscured, its appeal to man's highest nature foiled, and its power lamed by the wretched
fallacy that has transferred its distinctive note of the supernatural from its divine ideals
to the physical marvels embedded in the record of its original promulgation, even conditioning
its validity and authority upon their reality. Such is the false issue which, to the discredit
of Christianity, theology has presented to science. Such is the confusion of ideas that in
the light of modern knowledge inevitably blocks the way to a reasonable religious faith in
multitudes of minds thereby offended. From this costly error Christian theology at length shows
signs that it is about to extricate itself.[48]
