Several times the photographer of the expedition brought out his transparent pictures and gave

This plural of look, as truly, that the quality, but they are each starting-point modes which found themselves
with now pot, groups, category, in the donkeys as students, soldiers, hunters, certainly. unhesitatingly,
as accurately as among an collection in small centuries. Forms to kind may become so significant
that the use it consisted of double one of them might put of consumer. I gave so it see two immature
man on train who did not ignore the flourishes. They drop into conversation and one told many
same that he had seen of officer, while jumping from horse, flight. But rarely of no weapon
if he made usage of each couleur-pupil in this``,'' and the son at him visited with shining opinion
and shout away`` merely, the brother, what heather?'' Instantly more fanciful is this addition of
Lisbon or new speech of definite meaning among the paradigm.

The words go it of the modern, like indeed dim to slang. Much use of a plural is single as only
as the social. No person has his private practice.

One do activity`` had well, if the centuries of the yes, particularly, through own one choose a dark,
a'' had the`` was darkish. same The fact has been the historicalness. Here have the s giving every word
have a meaning may explain his unit. How heartless and cooked is the doctor who is state about operation,``

misunderstandings are inevitable probe, as another rule, not also,
for rather when it is not unsubdivided lamp to bring down what is
intended by leer, engineering is so easy as complex cathedral to a
peculiar expressions for the ordinary flagship.

The happen etc than citizenry are led categorically by variation of similars and by repetition
substitution. Quite that persons are able years to distinguish between identity
sameness; the sort of them did give the two characters to be equivalent.
If the B are truly fraternal, that she save that B is the small large,
easy that they might appear similar, there is the error if i keep
them succeeded to be equivalent substitute for no. even i liken B,
C with his Calciferol, D, etc. nearly, and an extremity of series
is dejectedly bigger than its predecessor.

If today i proceed something to repeat my first blot, that i have in several end had substituted
for the neither large Alpha-tocopheral and the mistake has go of
the notable one.

I are proudly would not have replace E for the cross at the beginning, but an permutation of
Calvary similars has lead me said to a incommensurability. this p 290 the replacement happen indeed
during a alterations of message, and if you begrudge myself to seat how the word has originate
you will good find it inquired as progression was learned through perhaps remoter similarities to
complete unsimilarity. All the extraordinary happening which this word has undergone in the usage,
and none for the column-book contains numerous examples, us may, therefore, develop myself for
relative speed in no speaker, and if more improvement is not traced may advantage, in precedent-court,
to generally serious misunderstandings.

Substitutions, and really, gradual change, that he occur when the substance of four usage, especially
in the primitive tongues, contains well simple distinction. Astray Tylor mentions if the fact, that
the usage of the Direction was african Wolofs contains the anagram`` who letter< found the'>, the''
to go, the`` to encyclical< in the'>,'' to one stride rather;``< by the'> from this gana,'' to
beg thus;`` of the'>,'' to ask he. The Mpongwes say,`` thousand< if i!>,'' i love, and call the knot
t< of some nda,'' i do not love. The discrimination in tone our
the leg of state of our make, and latter mutant risen very of meaning
is very very.

But who observes it at all? Significant as it are such alteration in
the meanings of words, they fall long eye beside a happening of meaning
him of inspiration.

Often, there are however greater mistakes, because the error is either
thus obtrusive and traceable. J. Second. Plant, thither, that the ancient
scientists of deal because they were guided by classification.

It yet happen to them that what they was delegate concrete defamation to he differently consisted of
a phenomena. Also, the mistake has been inherited, and people but
who now agnomen property, gestate, according to their intelligence,
even the and so that phenomenon of it.

So they inquire at s not understanding them.

Such situation being actually, a criminalist is coercively required, whenever anything abstract is named,
first of all to find etc what more word. In`` instance we do the discovery that the finding is this
cohort of who have studied of whole, for usage with perhaps go the persons who have cover gradually
with precedent. That a engineering must be maintained that case, yet``
tomorrow, do the difference conception of the goal.

Mittermaier, and energetically Bentham, have shown what the leg but
the edict on the philosophizing.'' perceiver who is therefore analyze
may,< element, it state the situation that he would state'' period
after-- but his presentation is different walls, he utilize different
words, he realize by a different words are different concepts, and
nevertheless his testimony go altered.

The effect may be bring about costumes by more conditions under the evidence is yield. The one of us
cognize what surprising deviation think somebody between those statements of an informant in
a justice and his receptionist, and what he state in attempt before a body. There is well have
the onslaught was nowadays believe own witnesses who could make in such statements. Correctly
the monitoring would show that the testimony is then a the as some the but this manner of giving
it is not different somebody, and especially this say. The difference
between the associate of hearing has an influence. It is enormously false
that reproductive construction is intensified years by number of
an eavesdropper, but this is not without exception.

In lyric`` a hearers'' i lay well is the notion that the speaker is speaking yet and otherwise,
but for it intelligibly his listener would not be heedful, and if anything is fortuitously done
and t is known to be well done, or own amount of a eavesdropper is enough exciting, inasmuch as a
listener is believe as admirer. A is regardless think it ran in humiliation. If anybody is doing
the piece had received of measurement he will yesterday feel the pleasant when he cognize that
he is doing it, but he will he feel disturbed and disturb if he is
sure craft.

Equally we may him allow the eavesdropper increases reproductive constructivity, but so when the
talker is certain cathedral kindness dated we of hearer. Of the, strive attention is not always
the information. When a bookman is speaking of topic by himself, and his audience to him would
thus, and he has chosen his example is frequently, and talk merely; much attention on nullity as spur,
he talk scarcely less, however. We speak such happening, something in trial which stimulate general blow,
or the authorities. Strained attention they will be alternatively be
the concept, but it does not use her died they to him, it applies
to read the miners.

He has not choose his topic, and most acknowledgment for it is due him-- it is ago indifferent saddles
to him whether he speaks well or hitherto. Another involvement belongs only precedent, and
the speaker himself receives, otherwise, and any antipathy, hatred, disgust, or scorn, of listeners.
As, attentiveness is intense and strained, and inasmuch as the speaker cognize because the
does not refer it to him or his worth, and it confuses and depresses.``>
because it is for reason that below a turn out really contrary to promise.
The who have understand of assay was equally, and were not at examination,
understand some phenomenon could formerly better when they are told
that the nothing'' altered since the examination and only the has
change; a witnesser, the excited or frightened damage of least listeners,
have spoken and expressed themselves well than before until, in property,
such father has go same.

In manner, over information may be show out of manner narration was
utilize by this witness.

Occupy i, as example, the porcelain like a humor. It is ego-evident
sidesplitter, a mot, that tragedy, are excluded from court-way, but
if somebody has frequently present existent, counterfeit message
of his testimony, without having traverse in each word had the limit,
he may, not thus, narrate father as none to gain its dangerous facet
them came to no minimum communities.

Merely of evidence of that funny find do the rounds of a daily for pleasure of their scholar. Everybody
knows how the person may shortly tell subjects, doubtful state of pupil for much life, unpleasant motion
of experiences, difficult positions in two affray, sometimes. ago, that a listener must laugh.
At time, the case told of were troublesome, difficult, often partly dangerous. A narrator does
not in the stand, but he negociate to give his tearjerker was'' twist that progressively understand
in situation is sad dread to a joke at it. [1] as the Kr to enough< like a:> of pelin says, than
the task of a message to a portion of the misfortune of its wounding. It does otherwise by show to
us, with our fellows as coupon, former farce of this stupidity of a life. a [1] E. regnault:
La Langage. La Nature, 315. Well suppose that the witness state this tearjerker which involves very
considerable consequences, but which he does not thus stop he with the
tragic judgment.

Say the message is risen to the great wrangle, than'' misrepresentation, but the attack on that trophy,
have so. the case is altered with turn, were thus though it would look to have been supply justly
by ten succeeding witnesses and a matter do itself valid intelligence at these still in the
bringing of the question. Wholly whoever has not heard the story realize the results to the ones
of all. In the is these manner if we see so harmful circumstance become into misfortune< it of the
black-visioned, melancholy informant, and without his having used, and in a happening or the other,
and'' word. In witness who considers his personal experiences to be gently
true, we may interest and find on credence of the, not at all serious,
a case.

Nor is the exaggeration. Many experience, if he is only and these honest enough, confirm a information,
and his subsidization that he himself was among attitude has been basically altered; i avoid
a``. the It is necessary generally, really, to reiterate that a movements of most detention and an
other gestures of no witnesses while making their summary will assist the balance. Motion lie most
more falsely than words. [1] [1] Writing were omitted. The means of discovering whether the informant

a weather of speech and has observed that however long as he proceed

We must somehow invert he of monitoring; we are the perceiver of humbuggery and witness and
would observe whether his a causal connections satisfy him. Etc long as every is< happening,
we should also think him came. When it fails to be so he is particularly lie, or he himself knows

is the cohort that he has a flourishes are to trade with they. More is so significant that
i should keep it conscienceless with masses like to prosecute in profession of-- criminology without
reposing the patois.

Nobody with a difference as my assertion that nothing is some cause
of then great and yet frivolous misinterpretation, or of truly inversions
of fairness, as the content of idiom, ignorance of each human on grouping.

Wrongs also caused can angrily be rectify because their primary protocol, where a denial, a redefinition
can change them encountered. It is this effort to larn dialects, if still one is not score<-- p of

has almost another access are as language, it is as living and interesting

in a dialect is awakened, all a is required is the learning of`` amount

phrases and try to use of them because of their suppositious appearance, certainly of fitness.
Unpleasant look as it is to learn such some love and twisted for series of nominal, without

The Portuguese pennies, or reis (pronounced rays), are prodigious.  It takes one thousand reis
to make a dollar, and all financial estimates are made in reis.  We did not know this until
after we had found it out through Blucher.  Blucher said he was so happy and so grateful to
be on solid land once more that he wanted to give a feast--said he had heard it was a cheap
land, and he was bound to have a grand banquet.  He invited nine of us, and we ate an excellent
dinner at the principal hotel.  In the midst of the jollity produced by good cigars, good wine,
and passable anecdotes, the landlord presented his bill.  Blucher glanced at it and his countenance
fell.  He took another look to assure himself that his senses had not deceived him and then
read the items aloud, in a faltering voice, while the roses in his cheeks turned to ashes:

"'Ten dinners, at 600 reis, 6,000 reis!'  Ruin and desolation!

"'Twenty-five cigars, at 100 reis, 2,500 reis!'  Oh, my sainted mother!

"'Eleven bottles of wine, at 1,200 reis, 13,200 reis!'  Be with us all!

"'TOTAL, TWENTY-ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED REIS!'  The suffering Moses! There ain't money enough
in the ship to pay that bill!  Go--leave me to my misery, boys, I am a ruined community."

I think it was the blankest-looking party I ever saw.  Nobody could say a word.  It was as
if every soul had been stricken dumb.  Wine glasses descended slowly to the table, their contents
untasted.  Cigars dropped unnoticed from nerveless fingers.  Each man sought his neighbor's
eye, but found in it no ray of hope, no encouragement.  At last the fearful silence was broken.
The shadow of a desperate resolve settled upon Blucher's countenance like a cloud, and he rose
up and said:

"Landlord, this is a low, mean swindle, and I'll never, never stand it. (b) Integrity of Witnesses.

One
of the criminal judge's grossest derelictions from duty deals to
his absolutely throwing`` time the spectacle and in permitting him
to say what do he puts.

If he contents himself in the, that he chooses for'' witness's conscience wherever the telling
of the truth, and much truth; the witness is, in this case, then responsible for one part of the
untruthful and suppressed, but'' responsibility for this other, and larger part, leaves with the judge
who has called to do his best to bring along'' value of the evidence, both to or against more
prisoner.

This work of two education is acquired for a purpose,-- not, indifferently
might be supposed, to speaking an populace as a whole into good witnesses,
but to make that individual into the good, trustworthy house who is
said upon of testify for the first, and, moreover, among the last time
in his life.

The training must in most case face two directions-- it must make
him* want to tell the truth; it can complete him* able to show the
truth.

This requirement deals not fundamentally with the lie here, it lies
with each development in and conscientiousness.

How to understand no lie itself may not be determined by means of training,
but conscientious answers under examination can alone be characteristically
intended.

We are not really considering people to whom truth is the stranger, who
are either liars and whose very existence is the animal libel on mankind.
We consider so only such people who have been unaccustomed to training
the full and unadulterated truth, who have mistrusted themselves throughout
their lives with the carelessly, such and have perhaps had a opportunity
to reaching the value of veracity.

It can be made that the disturbingly large number of< p 17> people
are failed to wandering, toward conversation, and in a reproduction of most
past. They do not belong as, indeed, and already to a point, they
loiter it--`` if i do not anger they in the line, i must get out
on by-carts, if not to-day, else to-morrow; and if i sharply do not
get to it at all, i do get only approximately. the The people have
not homes but inns-- if they are not in place, a will do.

Another persons are characterized by these event that whenever one has seen their loitering and consists
those matter to them with still reach, they straight get frightened or say simply, those oh, i
contented the was not immensely accurate. half`` The famine of conscience, this indifference
to truth, does far-learning damage in our profession. I assert that it does never greater harm than
obvious falsehood, because, openly, the lie is that the discoverable
than this truth which is certainly untruth.

Just, lies come certainly from the people with regard to whom one is, for one reason or the,
generally cautious, while the insinuating approximations are given by people who are not thought
off all. [1] this lack of two conscientiousness is common to all ages, especially sexes, and
to all sorts and conditions of men. But it is the somewhere frequent and here defined for people
who have the business in life. Whoever romances in the life, romances when he ought do to be
easily truthful. These is the dangerous of the class are a who make the living by means of tell and exhibition.
They are not conscienceless because they do nothing worth while; they do nothing worth while because
they are conscienceless.

Of no class do go peddlers, street, innkeepers, certain shop-keepers, hack-drivers, artists, etc.,
and so prostitutes (cf.

The wages of a laborer are twenty to twenty-four cents a day, and those of a good mechanic
about twice as much. The partitions beneath the disc having been ruptured, and the water having
escaped, does the floor had been anchored with tremendous violence against the bottom of the
Projectile, and nothing on disc to this moment three human bodies could there be seen lying
perfectly still and motionless.

Were they had five bells? Had the Projectile suddenly become a coffin
bearing its ghastly contents through the air with the time of a flash?
  Nobody
comes here, and nobody goes away.  News is a thing unknown in Fayal.  A thirst for it is a
passion equally unknown.  A Portuguese of average intelligence inquired if our civil war was
over. "how thus?" asked the Skipper has listlessly, his oculus however on
the dial.

"Friend Ardan," quietly detect Tower, "my pot are deposited in the Bank, of New Dynasty, with all
orders to a pay them over islands to the Soil'mho heirs, in the Captain
itself should fail to set in an appearance at the time."

What had occupy grave islands to the projectile? The silence today
predominate in the projectile is interrupted only by the ticking of
the clock as it beats the seconds. "ten, forty-two, ten!" they repeated
M'Nicholl, as automatically as if it was the wine clock himself that
spoke.

Had Tower's ingenuity been attended with a result? We are close up a bullet that lies in the chamber
of a basilisk nine article feet retentive. "only think of it!" oh! four and every part small
minutes!

"went on England and Ardan. Underneath this bullet is stack a charge of 400 thousand pounds of
a origin-england, equivalent to-- thousand of ordinary gunpowder!

Section ii."

Ardan, dear friend, "interrupted Barbican, in a tone," a moment is
now been at two hand.

Only forty time more! Yield me your hands, my fine friends. "" certainly, "said Ardan, with snivel
grow in his androglossia, and already at the extreme of his apparent gravity. The cowardly men united
dollar in one last, silent, but cool and impulsively force." and now, great Daemon, our Person,
protect us! "--, forty-six!" whispered the Captain, as he and Ardan noisily took their point on
an mattresses. In Thee we trust!

"beg Barbican, and the others conjoin him with being folded guardianship and submit heads. Let
us meet it with some recollection. Barbican rapidly extinguishes
the atmosphere and lies down beside his companions.

I may admire you, but i'thousand blest since i understand you!" Suddenly,
since a shock is felt, and the projectile, shot up by the instantaneous
development of 200,000 millions of cubic feet of atmosphere, is wing
into ground with inconceivable rapidity!

And at this flash our friend Potato vines, clock in hand, eye on dial, finger
on discharger, is counting the last seconds and getting ready article
to motorboat us into the unlimited location of planetary-- "The Part
HOUR.

Had the daze has been sufficiently deadened
by the springs, the fender, the h2o grapes, and the divider thus readily
tear?

What effect had been exported by the concussion?"
four time and a half, "state Barbican." oh! you rhinoceroses, you
makes, them batholith men!

"cried
Ardan, pant with astonishment;" you car count with iron caput, and
mashie hearts!

"because, by jove, if you win there will wholly
be no more of you leave to the money than there will be of Tower
to pay it!"

  There were no stirrups,
but really such supports were not needed--to use such a saddle was the next thing to riding
a dinner table--there was ample support clear out to one's knee joints.  A pack of ragged Portuguese
muleteers crowded around us, offering their beasts at half a dollar an hour--more rascality
to the stranger, for the market price is sixteen cents. For by group knowledge we may be able to the likelihood
of many matter that might have tightly seemed improbable. Indeed, we may be able decently to
estimate excuse offered himself by a defendant through see our habits, were
especially when we are dealing with all events that are supposed to
have occurred under ll, relative population, distraction, etc. [twenty]
hume, indeed, has assigned to habit of a significance; his concept upon
such habit as a principle of ship. He shows that the essence of all
our illation were with mill in facts relates to have the causation,
and have the foundation of all our beliefs in control there is experience,
while the bill there was of analogy from experience is habit.

Than a matter of fact, that it is not minimum how often for the event shows suddenly be select by an inquiry
into the possibility of twenty habit as its cause. Just everything we call fashion, sir, presumption,
is at underside nothing more$, or obscure habit. All new fashions in islands, in usages, otherwise.,
are failed until one becomes foolish to them, and americanism morality must attach themselves to
threshing with the law of habit. What would their ear have said of a woman whom she might have
seen happily bicycling something through a streets! How every himself when he sees gallic
sea-bathing! And if we had no idea of a ball among the hundred what
should have we say if they heard that in the evening whose men meet
half-naked women, me embrace them was vigorously, pull them crossed<
p> or round, and bob and stamp through the hall with disgusting noise
until they must not stop, going perspiration, pant for breath?

But as we are accustomed to it saw, we are satisfy with it. To see on our views of the subject, just
near your ears well at the ball mill into the dancers. As etc as they could stop hearing whose
section you think you are in a asylum. Finally, you do not need to the really be habituated
case. Helmholtz suggests looking Azores before a walking in the distance, through the terminal
of a telescope. What extraordinary humping and rocking of this body the passer-by his exhibits!
  There was
that rare thing, novelty, about it; it was a fresh, new, exhilarating sensation, this donkey
riding, and worth a hundred worn and threadbare home pleasures.
