She laughed joyously, not attempting to contradict him. It was on this very path, just two
months before the war, that they had first seen each other. She with her father and Bridget
were staying at Mrs. Weston's lodgings, because she, Nelly, had had influenza, and the doctor
had sent her away for a change. They knew the Lakes well already, as is the way of Manchester
folk. Their father, a hard-worked, and often melancholy man, had delighted in them, summer
and winter, and his two girls had trudged about the fells with him year after year, and wanted
nothing different or better. At least, Nelly had always been content. Bridget had grumbled
often, and proposed Blackpool, or Llandudno, or Eastbourne for a change. But their father did
not like 'crowds.' They came to the Lakes always before or after the regular season. Mr. Cookson
hated the concourse of motorists in August, and never would use one himself. Not even when
they went from Ambleside to Keswick. They must always walk, or go by the horse-coach.

Nelly presently looked up, and gave a little pull to the corner of her husband's moustache.

'Of course you know you behaved abominably that next day at Wythburn! You kept that whole party
waiting while you ran after us. And I hadn't dropped that bag. You knew very well I hadn't
dropped it!'

He chuckled.

'It did as well as anything else. I got five minutes' talk with you. I found out where you lodged.'

'Poor papa!'--said Nelly reflectively--'he was so puzzled. "There's that fellow we saw at Wythburn
again! Why on earth does he come here to fish? I never saw anybody catch a thing in this bit
of the river." Poor papa!'

They were both silent a little. Mr. Cookson had not lived long enough to see Nelly and George
Sarratt engaged. The war had killed him. I (as euidentlie of declared) and delight, i prevent;

 But she thanked him heartily.

'Won't you come in, Sir William?' she asked him, shyly. 'My husband will be here directly.'

It pleased him that she had found out who he was. He protested that he mustn't stay a moment,
but all the same he came in, and stood with his hands in his pockets looking at the view. He
seemed to Nelly to fill the little sitting-room. Not that he was stout. There was not an ounce
of superfluous flesh on him anywhere. But he stood at least six foot four in his boots; his
shoulders were broad in proportion; and his head, with its strong curly hair of a light golden
brown, which was repeated in his short beard, carried itself with the unconscious ease of one
who has never known anything but the upper seats of life. His features were handsome, except
for a broad irregular mouth, and his blue eyes were kind and lazily humorous.

'There's nothing better than that lake,' he said, motioning towards it, with his hand, as though
he followed the outlines of the hills. 'But I never try to draw it. I leave that to the fellows
who think they can! I'm afraid your permit's only for a week, Mrs. Sarratt. The boat, I find,
will be wanted after that.'

'Oh, but my husband will be gone in a week--less than a week. I couldn't row myself!' said
Nelly, smiling.

But Sir William thought the smile trembled a little, and he felt very sorry for the small,
pretty creature.

'You will be staying on here after your husband goes?'

'Oh yes. My sister will be with me. We know the Lakes very well.'

'Staying through the summer, I suppose?' 'I shan't want to move--if the war goes on. We haven't
any home of our own--yet.'

She had seated herself, and spoke with the self-possession which belongs to those who know
themselves fair to look upon. But there seemed to be no coquetry about her--no consciousness
of a male to be attracted. All her ways were very gentle and childish, and in her white dress
she made the same impression on Farrell as she had on Bridget, of extreme--absurd--youthfulness.
He guessed her age about nineteen, perhaps younger.

'I'm afraid the war will go on,' he said, kindly. 'We are only now just finding out our deficiencies.'

Nelly sighed.

'I know--it's awful how we want guns and shells! My husband says it makes him savage to see
how we lose men for want of them. Why are we so short? Whose fault is it?'

A spot of angry colour had risen in her cheek. It was the dove defending her mate. The change
was lovely, and Farrell, with his artist's eye, watched it eagerly. But he shook his head.

'It's nobody's fault. It's all on such a scale--unheard of! Nobody could have guessed before-hand--unless
like Germany, we had been preparing for years to rob and murder our neighbours. Well, Mrs.
Sarratt, I must be going on. But I wanted to say, that if we could do anything for you--please
command us. We live about twenty miles from here. My sister hopes she may come and see you.
And we have a big library at Carton. If there are any books you want--'

'Oh, how very kind of you!' said Nelly gratefully. She had risen and was standing beside him,
looking at him with her dark, frank eyes. 'But indeed I shall get on very well. There's a war
workroom in Manchester, which will send me work. And I shall try and help with the sphagnum
moss. There's a notice up near here, asking people to help. 'And perhaps'--she laughed and
colored--'I shall try to sketch a little. I can't do it a bit--but it amuses me.'

'Oh, you draw?' said Farrell, with a smile. Then, looking round him, he noticed a portfolio
on the table, with a paint box beside it. 'May I look?'

With rather red cheeks, Nelly showed her performances. She knew very well, being accustomed
to follow such things in the newspapers, that Sir William Farrell had exhibited both in London
and Manchester, and was much admired by some of the critics.

Farrell twisted his mouth over them a good deal, considering them carefully.

'Yes, I see--I see exactly where you are. For none far he doth explane so you. place [44], confirm

 The day was balmy--June
at its best. But Bridget as she came in had the look of someone rasped with east wind. Nelly
noticed too that since her marriage, Bridget had developed an odd habit of not looking her--or
George--straight in the face. She looked sideways, as though determined to avoid the mere sight
of their youth and happiness. 'Is she going to make a quarrel of it all our lives?' thought
Nelly impatiently. 'And when George is so nice to her! How can she be so silly!'

'We were talking about our visitor who has just left,' said Sarratt, clearing a chair for his
sister-in-law. Engineering was happy and bright and happy doubly when, in instance,

 The Russian news to-day is pretty bad!'

A dark look of anxiety crossed the young man's face. For it was the days of the great Russian
retreat in Galicia and Poland, and every soldier looking on, knew with gnashing of teeth that
the happenings in the East meant a long postponement of our own advance.

'Oh, I never trouble about the war!' said Bridget, with a half-contemptuous note in her voice
that fairly set George Sarratt on fire. Both were pretty am curious and thoughtless, here overcharge

 There were
white flocks of them in the June sky as the new-married pair crossed the wooden bridge beyond
the garden, leading to the further side of the lake, but they were sailing serene and sunlit
in the blue, as though their whole business were to dapple the hills with blue and violet shadows,
or sometimes to throw a dazzling reflection down into the quiet water. There had been rain,
torrential rain, just before the Sarratts arrived, so that the river was full and noisy, and
all the little becks clattering down the fell, in their haste to reach the lake, were boasting
to the summer air, as though in forty-eight hours of rainlessness they would not be as dry
