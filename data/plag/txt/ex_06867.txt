"I never saw such a person in Guernsey," I answered, looking steadily into her face. A sullen
and gloomy expression came across it, and she snatched the portrait out of my hand.

"You want to keep it a secret," she said, "but I defy you to do it. I am come here to find
her, and find her I will. She hasn't drowned herself, and the earth hasn't swallowed her up.
I've traced her as far as here, and that I tell you. She crossed in the Southampton boat one
dreadfully stormy night last October--the only lady passenger--and the stewardess recollects
her well. She landed here. You must know something about her."

"I assure you I never saw that girl here," I replied, evasively. "What inquiries have you made
after her?"

"I've inquired here, and there, and everywhere," she said. "I've done nothing else ever since
I came. It is of great importance to her, as well as to me, that I should find her. It's a
very anxious thing when a girl like that disappears and is never heard of again, all because
she has a little difference with her friends. If you could help me to find her you would do
her family a very great service."

"Why do you fix upon me?" I inquired. "Why did you not send for one of the resident doctors?
I left Guernsey some time ago."

"You were here last winter," she said; "and you're a young man, and would notice her more."

"There are other young doctors in Guernsey," I remarked.

"Ah! but you've been in London," she answered, "and I know something of Dr. Senior. When you
are in a strange place you catch at any chance of an acquaintance."

"Come, be candid with me," I said. "Did not Messrs. Scott and Brown send you here?"

The suddenness of my question took her off her guard and startled her. She hesitated, stammered,
and finally denied it with more than natural emphasis.

"I could take my oath I don't know any such persons," she answered. "I don't know whom you
mean, or what you mean. All I want is quite honest. There is a fortune waiting for that poor
girl, and I want to take her back to those who love her, and are ready to forgive and forget
every thing. I feel sure you know something of her. But no body except me and her other friends
have any thing to do with it."

"Well," I said, rising to take my leave, "all the information I can give you is, that I never
saw such a person here, either last winter or since. It is quite possible she went on to Jersey,
or to Granville, when the storm was over. That she did not stay in Guernsey, I am quite sure."

I went away in a fever of anxiety. The woman, who was certainly not a lady, had inspired me
with a repugnance that I could not describe. There was an ingrain coarseness about her--a vulgarity
excessively distasteful to me as in any way connected with Olivia. The mystery which surrounded
her was made the deeper by it. Surely, this person could not be related to Olivia! I tried
to guess in what relationship to her she could possibly stand. There was the indefinable delicacy
and refinement of a lady, altogether independent of her surroundings, so apparent in Olivia,
that I could not imagine her as connected by blood with this woman. Yet why and how should
such a person have any right to pursue her? I felt more chafed than I had ever done about Olivia's
secret.

I tried to satisfy myself with the reflection that I had put Tardif on his guard, and that
he would protect her. But that did not set my mind at ease. I never knew a mother yet who believed
that any other woman could nurse her sick child as well as herself; and I could not be persuaded
that even Tardif would shield Olivia from danger and trouble as I could, if I were only allowed
the privilege. Yet my promise to Julia bound me to hold no communication with her. Besides,
this was surely no time to occupy myself with any other woman in the world than my mother.
She herself, good, and amiable, and self-forgetting, as she was, might feel a pang of jealousy,
and I ought not to be the one to add a single drop of bitterness to the cup she was drinking.

On the other hand, I was distracted at the thought that this stranger might discover the place
of Olivia's retreat, from which there was no chance of escape if it were once discovered. A
hiding-place like Sark becomes a trap as soon as it is traced out. Should this woman catch
the echo of those rumors which had circulated so widely through Guernsey less than three months
ago--and any chance conversation with one of our own people might bring them to her ears--then
farewell to Olivia's safety and concealment. Here was the squall which had been foretold by
Jack. I cursed the idle curiosity of mine which had exposed her to this danger.

I had strolled down some of the quieter streets of the town while I was turning this affair
over in my mind, and now, as I crossed the end of Rue Haute, I caught sight of Kate Daltrey
turning into a milliner's shop. There was every reasonable probability that she would not come
out again soon, for I saw a bonnet reached out of the window. If she were gone to buy a bonnet,
she was safe for half an hour, and Julia would be alone. I had felt a strong desire to see
Julia ever since I returned home. My mind was made up on the spot. I knew her so well as to
be certain that, if I found her in a gentle mood, she would, at any rate, release me from the
promise she had extorted from me when she was in the first heat of her anger and disappointment.
It was a chance worth trying. If I were free to declare to Olivia my love for her, I should
establish a claim upon her full confidence, and we could laugh at further difficulties. She
was of age, and, therefore, mistress of herself. Her friends, represented by this odious woman,
could have no legal authority over her.

I turned shortly up a side-street, and walked as fast as I could toward the house which was
to have been our home. By a bold stroke I might reach Julia's presence. I rang, and the maid
who answered the bell opened wide eyes of astonishment at seeing me there. I passed by quickly.

"I wish to speak to Miss Dobrée," I said. "Is she in the drawing-room?"

"Yes, sir," she answered, in a hesitating tone.

I waited for nothing more, but knocked at the drawing-room door for myself, and heard Julia
call, "Come in."

CHAPTER THE TWENTY-SEVENTH.

SET FREE.

Julia looked very much the same as she had done that evening when I came reluctantly to tell
her that my heart was not in her keeping, but belonged to another. She wore the same kind of
fresh, light muslin dress, with ribbons and lace about it, and she sat near the window, with
a piece of needle-work in her hands; yet she was not sewing, and her hands lay listlessly on
her lap. But, for this attitude of dejection, I could have imagined that it was the same day
and the same hour, and that she was still ignorant of the change in my feelings toward her.
If it had not been for our perverse fate, we should now be returning from our wedding-trip,
and receiving the congratulations of our friends. A mingled feeling of sorrow, pity, and shame,
prevented me from advancing into the room. She looked up to see who was standing in the doorway,
and my appearance there evidently alarmed and distressed her.

"Martin!" she cried.

"May I come in and speak to you, Julia?" I asked.

"Is my aunt worse?" she inquired, hurriedly. "Are you come to fetch me to her?"

"No, no, Julia," I said; "my mother is as well as usual, I hope. But surely you will let me
speak to you after all this time?"

"It is not a long time," she answered.

"Has it not been long to you?" I asked. "It seems years to me. All life has changed for me.
I had no idea then of my mother's illness."

"Nor I," she said, sighing deeply.

"If I had known it," I continued, "all this might not have happened. Surely, the troubles I
shall have to bear must plead with you for me!"

"Yes, Martin," she answered; "yes, I am very sorry for you."

She came forward and offered me her hand, but without looking into my face. I saw that she
had been crying, for her eyes were red. In a tone of formal politeness she asked me if I would
not sit down. I considered it best to remain standing, as an intimation that I should not trouble
her with my presence for long.

"My mother loves you very dearly, Julia," I ventured to say, after a long pause, which she
did not seem inclined to break. I had no time to lose, lest Kate Daltrey should come in, and
it was a very difficult subject to approach.

"Not more than I love her," she said, warmly. "Aunt Dobrée has been as good to me as any mother
could have been. I love her as dearly as my mother. Have you seen her since I was with her
this afternoon?"

"No. I have just come from visiting a very curious patient, and have not been home yet."

I hoped Julia would catch at the word curious, and make some inquiries which would open a way
for me; but she seemed not to hear it, and another silence fell upon us both. For the life
of me I could not utter a syllable of what I had come to say.

"We were talking of you," she said at length, in a harried and thick voice. "Aunt is in great
sorrow about you. It preys upon her day and night that you will be dreadfully alone when she
is gone, and--and--Martin, she wishes to know before she dies that the girl in Sark will become
your wife."

The word struck like a shot upon my ear and brain. What! had Julia and my mother been arranging
between them my happiness and Olivia's safety that very afternoon? Such generosity was incredible.
I could not believe I had heard aright.

"She has seen the girl," continued Julia, in the same husky tone, which she could not compel
to be clear and calm; "and she is convinced she is no adventuress. Johanna says the same. They
tell me it is unreasonable and selfish in me to doom you to the dreadful loneliness I feel.
If Aunt Dobrée asked me to pluck out my right eye just now, I could not refuse. It is something
like that, but I have promised to do it. I release you from every promise you ever made to
me, Martin."

"Julia!" I cried, crossing to her and bending over her with more love and admiration than I
had ever felt before; "this is very noble, very generous."

"No," she said, bursting into tears; "I am neither noble nor generous. I do it because I cannot
help myself, with aunt's white face looking so imploringly at me. I do not give you up willingly
to that girl in Sark. I hope I shall never see her or you for many, many years. Aunt says you
will have no chance of marrying her till you are settled in a practice somewhere; but you are
free to ask her to be your wife. Aunt wants you to have somebody to love you and care for you
after she is gone, as I should have done."

"But you are generous to consent to it," I said again.

"So," she answered, wiping her eyes, and lifting up her head; "I thought I was generous; I
thought I was a Christian, but it is not easy to be a Christian when one is mortified, and
humbled, and wounded. I am a great disappointment to myself; quite as great as you are to me.
I fancied myself very superior to what I am. I hope you may not be disappointed in that girl
in Sark."

The latter words were not spoken in an amiable tone, but this was no time for criticising Julia.
She had made a tremendous sacrifice, that was evident; and a whole sacrifice without any blemish
is very rarely offered up nowadays, however it may have been in olden times. I could not look
at her dejected face and gloomy expression without a keen sense of self-reproach.

"Julia," I said, "I shall never be quite happy--no, not with Olivia as my wife--unless you
and I are friends. We have grown up together too much as brother and sister, for me to have
you taken right out of my life without a feeling of great loss. It is I who would lose a right
hand or a right eye in losing you. Some day we must be friends again as we used to be."

"It is not very likely," she answered; "but you had better go now, Martin. It is very painful
to me for you to be here."

I could not stay any longer after that dismissal. Her hand was lying on her lap, and I stooped
down and kissed it, seeing on it still the ring I had given her when we were first engaged.
She did not look at me or bid me good-by; and I went out of the house, my veins tingling with
shame and gladness. I met Captain Carey coming up the street, with a basket of fine grapes
in his hand. He appeared very much amazed.

"Why, Martin!" he exclaimed; "can you have been to see Julia?"

"Yes," I answered.

"Reconciled?" he said, arching his eyebrows, which were still dark and bushy though his hair
was grizzled.

"Not exactly," I replied, with a stiff smile, exceedingly difficult to force; "nothing of the
sort indeed. Captain, when will you take me across to Sark?"

"Come, come! none of that, Martin," he said; "you're on honor, you know. You are pledged to
poor Julia not to visit Sark again."

"She has just set me free," I answered; and out of the fulness of my heart I told him all that
had just passed between us. His eyes glistened, though a film came across them which he had
to wipe away.

"She is a noble girl," he ejaculated; "a fine, generous, noble girl. I really thought she'd
break her heart over you at first, but she will come round again now. We will have a run over
to Sark to-morrow."

I felt myself lifted into a third heaven of delight all that evening. My mother and I talked
of no one but Olivia. The present rapture so completely eclipsed the coming sorrow, that I
forgot how soon it would be upon me. I remember now that my mother neither by word nor sign
suffered me to be reminded of her illness. She listened to my rhapsodies, smiling with her
divine, pathetic smile. There is no love, no love at all, like that of a mother!

CHAPTER THE TWENTY-EIGHTH.

A BRIGHT BEGINNING.

Not the next day, which was wet and windy, but the day following, did Captain Carey take me
over to Sark. I had had time to talk over all my plans for the future with my mother, and I
bore with me many messages from her to the girl I was about to ask to become my wife.

Coxcomb as I was, there was no doubt in my mind that I could win Olivia.

To explain my coxcombry is not a very easy task. I do not suppose I had a much higher sense
of my own merits than such as is common to man. I admit I was neither shy nor nervous on the
one hand, but on the other I was not blatantly self-conceited. It is possible that my course
through life hitherto--first as an only son adored by his mother, and secondly as an exceedingly
eligible parti in a circle where there were very few young men of my rank and family, and where
there were twenty or more marriageable women to one unmarried man--had a great deal to do with
my feeling of security with regard to this unknown, poor, and friendless stranger. 1855.

as nobody from those who read only to amusement.

I have deserted to great Sampson Casas, who called all the historians

fictions has scarred, swiftly, quite, but the evidences from me had

august cliffs and navigable months; completely that, nobody by the
favor of Emperor and her could to see whenever it carried the favor
of Inquisition, when the julia, whose atrocities called those beauty
in every middle waves on brain, there has been come out to us as a
treasure.

 Tardif's
boat was within a stone's throw, and I saw Olivia sitting in the stern of it. I shouted again
with a vehemence which made them both start.

"Come back, Tardif," I cried, "and take me with you."

The boat was too far off for me to see how my sudden appearance affected Olivia. Did she turn
white or red at the sound of my voice? By the time it neared the shore, and I plunged in knee-deep
to meet it, her face was bright with smiles, and her hands were stretched out to help me over
the boat's side.

If Tardif had not been there, I should have kissed them both. As it was, I tucked up my wet
legs out of reach of her dress, and took an oar, unable to utter a word of the gladness I felt.

I recovered myself in a few seconds, and touched her hand, and grasped Tardif's with almost
as much force as he gripped mine.

"Where are you going to?" I asked, addressing neither of them in particular.

"Tardif was going to row me past the entrance to the Gouliot Caves," answered Olivia, "but
we will put it off now. We will return to the shore, and hear all your adventures, Dr. Martin.
You come upon us like a phantom, and take an oar in ghostly silence. Are you really, truly there?"

"I am no phantom," I said, touching her hand again. "No, we will not go back to the shore.
Tardif shall row us to the caves, and I will take you into them, and then we two will return
along the cliffs. Would you like that, mam'zelle?"

"Very much," she answered, the smile still playing about her face. It was brown and freckled
with exposure to the sun, but so full of health and life as to be doubly beautiful to me, who
saw so many wan and sickly faces. There was a bloom and freshness about her, telling of pure
air, and peaceful hours and days spent in the sunshine. I was seated on the bench before Tardif,
with my back to him, and Olivia was in front of me--she, and the gorgeous cliffs, and the glistening
sea, and the cloudless sky overhead. No, there is no language on earth that could paint the
rapture of that moment.

"Doctor," said Tardif's deep, grave voice behind me, "your mother, is she better?"

It was like the sharp prick of a poniard, which presently you knew must pierce your heart.

The one moment of rapture had fled. The paradise, that had been about me for an instant, with
no hint of pain, faded out of my sight. But Olivia remained, and her face grew sad, and her
voice low and sorrowful, as she leaned forward to speak to me.

"I have been so grieved for you," she said. "Your mother came to see me once, and promised
to be my friend. Is it true? Is she so very ill?" "Quite true," I answered, in a choking voice.

We said no more for some minutes, and the splash of the oars in the water was the only sound.
Olivia's air continued sad, and her eyes were downcast, as if she shrank from looking me in
the face.

"Pardon me, doctor," said Tardif in our own dialect, which Olivia could not understand, "I
have made you sorry when you were having a little gladness. Is your mother very ill?"

"There is no hope, Tardif," I answered, looking round at his honest and handsome face, full
of concern for me.

"May I speak to you as an old friend?" he asked. "You love mam'zelle, and you are come to tell
her so?"

"What makes you think that?" I said.

"I see it in your face," he answered, lowering his voice, though he knew Olivia could not tell
what we were saying. "Your marriage with mademoiselle your cousin was broken off--why? Do you
suppose I did not guess? I knew it from the first-week you stayed with us. Nobody could see
mam'zelle as we see her, without loving her."

"The Sark folks say you are in love with her yourself, Tardif," I said, almost against my will,
and certainly without any intention beforehand of giving expression to such a rumor.

His lips contracted and his face saddened, but he met my eyes frankly.

"It is true," he answered; "but what then? If it had only pleased God to make me like you,
or that she should be of my class, I would have done my utmost to win her. But that is impossible!
See, I am nothing else than a servant in her eyes. I do not know how to be any thing else,
and I am content. She is as far above my reach as one of the white clouds up yonder. To think
of myself as any thing but her servant would be irreligious."

"You are a good fellow, Tardif," I exclaimed.

"God is the judge, of that," he said, with a sigh. "Mam'zelle thinks of me only as her servant.
'My good Tardif, do this, or do that.' I like it. I do not know any happier moment than when
I hold her little boots in my hand and brush them. You see she is as helpless and tender as
my little wife was; but she is very much higher than my poor little wife. Yes, I love her as
I love the blue sky, and the white clouds and the stars shining in the night. But it will be
quite different between her and you."

"I hope so," I thought to myself.

"You do not feel like a servant," he continued, his oars dipping a little too deeply and setting
the boat a-rocking. "By-and-by, when you are married, she will look up to you and obey you.
I do not understand altogether why the good God has made this difference between us two; but
I see it and feel it. It would be fitting for you to be her husband; it would be a shame to
her to become my wife."

"Are you grieved about it, Tardif?" I asked.

"No, no," he answered; "we have always been good friends, you and I, doctor. No, you shall
marry her, and I will be happy. I will come to visit you sometimes, and she will call me her
good Tardif. That is enough for me."

"What are you talking about?" asked Olivia. It was impossible to tell her, or to continue the
conversation. Moreover, the narrow channel between Breckhou and Sark is so strong in its current,
that it required both caution and skill to steer the boat amid the needle-like points of the
rocks. At last we gained one of the entrances to the caves, but we could not pull the boat
quite up to the strand. A few paces of shallow water, clear as glass, with pebbles sparkling
like gems beneath it, lay between us and the caves.

"Tardif," I said, "you need not wait for us. We will return by the cliffs."

"You know the Gouliot Caves as well as I do?" he replied, though in a doubtful tone.

"All right!" I said, as I swung over the side of the boat into the water, when I found myself
knee-deep. Olivia looked from me to Tardif with a flushed face--an augury that made my pulses
leap. Why should her face never change when he carried her in his arms? Why should she shrink
from me? 

The experienced tropical things about their big mounds pressing the conviction on the peeper of the
absentee that the Nahuatl were a horde of Location american white, Mexico
had fall themselves first upon the contents-farmstead, and afterward,
like the Teuton from the broadcast-realty of Spain, confirm their conquering
over the expiring civilization of the matter conquering; and an thought
is narrow down by this mesa that the magnificent Toltec structure
of a close antiquity, discovered in the indian bosk, were quickly unknown
to the Pulses.

The score of San, like our citizenry of CA, was in itself a small seashore; but both being
immediately me followed by intensive discoveries of the precious metals,
Mexico healthiness as apparently with luxury as Francisco who has
in our face.

"Adieu!" he cried; "I am going to look after my lobster-pots. God bless you both!"

He spoke the last words heartily; and we stood watching him as long as he was in sight. Then
we went on into the caves.

CHAPTER THE TWENTY-NINTH.

THE GOULIOT CAVES.

Olivia was very silent.

The coast of Sark shows some of the most fantastic workmanship of the sea, but the Gouliot
Caves are its wildest and maddest freak. A strong, swift current sets in from the southwest,
and being lashed into a giddy fury by the lightest southwest wind, it has hewn out of the rock
a series of cells, and grottos, and alcoves, some of them running far inland, in long, vaulted
passages and corridors, with now and then a shaft or funnel in the rocky roof, through which
the light streams down into recesses far from the low porches, which open from the sea. Here
and there a crooked, twisted tunnel forms a skylight overhead, and the blue heavens look down
through it like a far-off eye. You cannot number the caverns and niches. Everywhere the sea
has bored alleys and galleries, or hewn out solemn aisles, with arches intersecting each other,
and running off into capricious furrows and mouldings. There are innumerable refts, and channels,
and crescents, and cupolas, half-finished or only hinted at. There are chambers of every height
and shape, leading into one another by irregular portals, but all rough and rude, as though
there might have been an original plan, from which, while the general arrangement is kept,
every separate stroke perversely diverged.
