THE OPEN DOOR.

There are many interesting hotels scattered about the world, with a few of which I am acquainted
and with a great many of which I am not. Of course all hotels are interesting, from one point
of view or another. In fact, the surest way to fix an audience's attention is to introduce
your hero, or to display your opening chorus in the lobby or along the façade of a hotel. The
life, the movement and colour, the drifting individualities, the pretence, the bluff, the self-consciousness,
the independence, the ennui, the darting or lounging servants, the very fact that of those
before your eyes seven out of ten are drawn from distant and scattered places, are sufficient
in themselves to invest the smallest hostelry with glamour. It is not of this general interest
that I would now speak. Nor is it my intention at present to glance at the hotels wherein "quaintness"
is specialized, whether intentionally or no. There are thousands of them; and all of them well
worth the discriminating traveller's attention. Concerning some of them--as the old inns at
Dives-sur-Mer and at Mont St. Michel--whole books have been written. These depend for their
charm on a mingled gift of the unusual and the picturesque. There are, as I have said, thousands
of them; and of their cataloguing, should one embark on so wide a sea, there could be no end.
And, again, I must for convenience exclude the altogether charming places, like the Tour d'Argent
of Paris, Simpson's of the Strand,[1] and a dozen others that will spring to every traveller's
memory, where the personality of the host, or of a chef, or even a waiter, is at once a magnet
for the attraction of visitors and a reward for their coming. These, too, are many. In the
interest to which I would draw attention, the hotel as a building or as an institution has
little part. It is indeed a façade, a mise en scènebefore which play the actors that attract
our attention and applause. The set may be as modernly elaborate as Peacock Alley of the Waldorf
or the templed lobby of the St. Francis; or it may present the severe and Elizabethan simplicity
of the stone-paved veranda of the Norfolk at Nairobi--the matter is quite inessential to the
spectator. His appreciation is only slightly and indirectly influenced by these things. Sunk
in his arm-chair--of velvet or of canvas--he puffs hard and silently at his cigar, watching
and listening as the pageant and the conversation eddy by.

Of such hotels I number that gaudy and polysyllabic hostelry the Grand Hôtel du Louvre et de
la Paix at Marseilles. I am indifferent to the facts that it is situated on that fine thoroughfare,
the Rue de Cannebière, which the proud and untravelled native devoutly believes to be the finest
street in the world; that it possesses a dining-room of gilded and painted repoussé work so
elaborate and wonderful that it surely must be intended to represent a tinsmith's dream of
heaven; that its concierge is the most impressive human being on earth except Ludwig von Kampf
(whom I have never seen); that its head waiter is sadder and more elderly and forgiving than
any other head waiter; and that its hushed and cathedral atmosphere has been undisturbed through
immemorial years. That is to be expected; and elsewhere to be duplicated in greater or lesser
degree. Nor in the lofty courtyard, or the equally lofty halls and reading-rooms, is there
ever much bustle and movement. On hollow steel had the speed can be drawn out to the low and could

reheating for forging.
 Therefore they stretch their long, lean frames in the
wicker chairs, they sip the long drinks at their elbows, puff slowly at their long, lean cheroots,
and talk spasmodically in short sentences.

Of quite a different type are those going out--young fellows full of northern health and energy,
full of the eagerness of anticipation, full of romance skilfully concealed, self-certain, authoritative,
clear voiced. Their exit from the bus is followed by a rain of hold-alls, bags, new tin boxes,
new gun cases, all lettered freshly--an enormous kit doomed to diminution. They overflow the
place, ebb towards their respective rooms; return scrubbed and ruddy, correctly clad, correctly
unconscious of everybody else; sink into more wicker chairs. The quiet brown and yellow men
continue to puff at their cheroots, quite eclipsed. After a time one of them picks up his battered
old sun helmet and goes out into the street. The eyes of the newcomers follow him. They fall
silent; and their eyes, under cover of pulled moustache, furtively glance towards the lean
man's companions. Then on that office falls a great silence, broken only by the occasional
rare remarks of the quiet men with the cheroots. The youngsters are listening with all their
ears, though from their appearance no one would suspect that fact. Not a syllable escapes them.
These quiet men have been there; they have seen with their own eyes; their lightest word is
saturated with the mystery and romance of the unknown. Their easy, matter-of-fact, everyday
knowledge is richly wonderful. It would seem natural for these young-young men to question
these old-young men of that which they desire so ardently to know; but that isn't done, you
know. So they sit tight, and pretend they are not listening, and feast their ears on the wonderful
syllables--Ankobar, Kabul, Peshawur, Annam, Nyassaland, Kerman, Serengetti, Tanganika, and
many others. On these beautiful syllables must their imaginations feed, for that which is told
is as nothing at all. Adventure there is none, romance there is none, mention of high emprise
there is none. Adventure, romance, high emprise have to these men somehow lost their importance.
Perhaps such things have been to them too common--as well mention the morning egg. Perhaps
they have found that there is no genuine adventure, no real romance except over the edge of
the world where the rainbow stoops.

The bus rattles in and rattles out again. It takes the fresh-faced young men down past the
inner harbour to where lie the tall ships waiting. They and their cargo of exuberance, of hope,
of energy, of thirst for the bubble adventure, the rainbow romance, sail away to where these
wares have a market. And the quiet men glide away to the North. Their wares have been marketed.
The sleepy, fierce, passionate, sunny lands have taken all they had to bring. And have given
in exchange? Indifference, ill-health, a profound realization that the length of days are as
nothing at all; a supreme agnosticism as to the ultimate value of anything that a single man
can do, a sublime faith that it must be done, the power to concentrate, patience illimitable;
contempt for danger, disregard of death, the intention to live; a final, weary estimate of
the fact that mere things are as unimportant here as there, no matter how quaintly or fantastically
they are dressed or named, and a corresponding emptiness of anticipation for the future--these
items are only a random few of the price given by the ancient lands for that which the northern
races bring to them. What other alchemical changes have been wrought only these lean and weary
men could know--if they dared look so far within themselves. And even if they dared, they would
not tell.

THE FAREWELL.

We boarded ship, filled with a great, and what seemed to us, an unappeasable curiosity as to
what we were going to see. It was not a very big ship, in spite of the grandiloquent descriptions
in the advertisements, or the lithograph wherein she cut grandly and evenly through huge waves
to the manifest discomfiture of infinitesimal sailing craft bobbing alongside. She was manned
entirely by Germans. The room stewards waited at table, cleaned the public saloons, kept the
library, rustled the baggage, and played in the band. That is why we took our music between
meals. Our staterooms were very tiny indeed. Each was provided with an electric fan; a totally
inadequate and rather aggravating electric fan once we had entered the Red Sea. Just at this
moment we paid it little attention, for we were still in full enjoyment of sunny France, where,
in our own experience, it had rained two months steadily. Indeed, at this moment it was raining,
raining a steady, cold, sodden drizzle that had not even the grace to pick out the surface
of the harbour in the jolly dancing staccato that goes far to lend attraction to a genuinely
earnest rainstorm.

Down the long quay splashed cabs and omnibuses, their drivers glistening in wet capes, to discharge
under the open shed at the end various hasty individuals who marshalled long lines of porters
with astonishing impedimenta and drove them up the gang-plank. A half-dozen roughs lounged
aimlessly. A little bent old woman with a shawl over her head searched here and there. Occasionally
she would find a twisted splinter of wood torn from the piles by a hawser or gouged from the
planking by heavy freight, or kicked from the floor by the hoofs of horses. This she deposited
carefully in a small covered market basket. She was entirely intent on this minute and rather
pathetic task, quite unattending the greatness of the ship, or the many people the great hulk
swallowed or spat forth.

Near us against the rail leaned a dark-haired young Englishman whom later every man on that
many-nationed ship came to recognize and to avoid as an insufferable bore. Now, however, the
angel of good inspiration stooped to him. He tossed a copper two-sou piece down to the bent
old woman. She heard the clink of the fall, and looked up bewildered. One of the waterside
roughs slouched forward. The Englishman shouted a warning and a threat, indicating in pantomime
for whom the coin was intended. To our surprise that evil-looking wharf rat smiled and waved
his hand reassuringly, then took the old woman by the arm to show her where the coin had fallen.
She hobbled to it with a haste eloquent of the horrible Marseillaise poverty-stricken alleys,
picked it up joyously, turned--and with a delightful grace kissed her finger-tips towards the ship.

Apparently we all of us had a few remaining French coins; and certainly we were all grateful
to the young Englishman for his happy thought. The sous descended as fast as the woman could
get to where they fell. So numerous were they that she had no time to express her gratitude
except in broken snatches or gesture, in interrupted attitudes of the most complete thanksgiving.
The day of miracles for her had come; and from the humble poverty that valued tiny and infrequent
splinters of wood she had suddenly come into great wealth. Everybody was laughing, but in a
very kindly sort of way it seemed to me; and the very wharf rats and gamins, wolfish and fierce
in their everyday life of the water-front, seemed to take a genuine pleasure in pointing out
to her the resting-place of those her dim old eyes had not seen. Silver pieces followed. These
were too wonderful. She grew more and more excited, until several of the passengers leaning
over the rail began to murmur warningly, fearing harm. After picking up each of these silver
pieces, she bowed and gestured very gracefully, waving both hands outward, lifting eyes and
hands to heaven, kissing her fingers, trying by every means in her power to express the dazzling
wonder and joy that this unexpected marvel was bringing her. When she had done all these things
many times, she hugged herself ecstatically. A very well-dressed and prosperous-looking Frenchman
standing near seemed to be a little afraid she might hug him. His fear had, perhaps, some grounds,
for she shook hands with everybody all around, and showed them her wealth in her kerchief,
explaining eagerly, the tears running down her face.

Now the gang-plank was drawn aboard, and the band struck up the usual lively air. At the first
notes the old woman executed a few feeble little jig steps in sheer exuberance. Then the solemnity
of the situation sobered her. Her great, wealthy, powerful, kind friends were departing on
their long voyage over mysterious seas. Middle will be observe that the toilet to a lineal are total 1,

Here were two streets running across one another, both brilliantly lighted, both thronged,
both lined with little shops. In the latter one could buy anything, in any language, with any
money. In them we saw cheap straw hats made in Germany hung side by side with gorgeous and
beautiful stuffs from the Orient; shoddy European garments and Eastern jewels; cheap celluloid
combs and curious embroideries. The crowd of passers-by in the streets were compounded in the
same curiously mixed fashion; a few Europeans, generally in white, and then a variety of Arabs,
Egyptians, Somalis, Berbers, East Indians and the like, each in his own gaudy or graceful costume.
It speaks well for the accuracy of feeling, anyway, of our various "Midways," "Pikes," and
the like of our world's expositions that the streets of Port Said looked like Midways raised
to the nth power. Along them we sauntered with a pleasing feeling of self-importance. On all
sides we were gently and humbly besought--by the shopkeepers, by the sidewalk vendors, by would-be
guides, by fortune-tellers, by jugglers, by magicians; all soft-voiced and respectful; all
yielding as water to rebuff, but as quick as water to glide back again. The vendors were of
the colours of the rainbow, and were heavily hung with long necklaces of coral or amber, with
scarves, with strings of silver coins, with sequinned veils and silks, girt with many dirks
and knives, furnished out in concealed pockets with scarabs, bracelets, sandalwood boxes or
anything else under the broad canopy of heaven one might or might not desire. Their voices
were soft and pleasing, their eyes had the beseeching quality of a good dog's, their anxious
and deprecating faces were ready at the slightest encouragement to break out into the friendliest
and most intimate of smiles. Wherever we went we were accompanied by a retinue straight out
of the Arabian Nights, patiently awaiting the moment when we should tire; should seek out the
table of a sidewalk café; and should, in our relaxed mood, be ready to unbend to our royal
purchases.

At that moment we were too much interested in the town itself. The tiny shops, with their smiling
and insinuating Oriental keepers, were fascinating in their displays of carved woods, jewellery,
perfumes, silks, tapestries, silversmiths' work, ostrich feathers, and the like. To either
side the main street lay long narrow dark alleys, in which flared single lights, across which
flitted mysterious long-robed figures, from which floated stray snatches of music either palpitatingly
barbaric or ridiculously modern. There the authority of the straight, soldierly-looking Soudanese
policemen ceased, and it was not safe to wander unarmed or alone.

Besides these motley variegations of the East and West, the main feature of the town was the
street car. It was an open-air structure of spacious dimensions, as though benches and a canopy
had been erected rather haphazard on a small dancing platform. The track is absurdly narrow
in gauge; and as a consequence the edifice swayed and swung from side to side. A single mule
was attached to it loosely by about ten feet of rope. It was driven by a gaudy ragamuffin in
a turban. Various other gaudy ragamuffins lounged largely and picturesquely on the widely spaced
benches. Whence it came or whither it went I do not know. Its orbit swung into the main street,
turned a corner, and disappeared. Apparently Europeans did not patronize this picturesque wreck,
but drove elegantly but mysteriously in small open cabs conducted by totally incongruous turbaned
drivers.

We ended finally at an imposing corner hotel, where we dined by an open window just above the
level of the street. A dozen upturned faces besought us silently during the meal. At a glance
of even the mildest interest a dozen long brown arms thrust the spoils of the East upon our
consideration. With us sat a large benign Swedish professor whose erudition was encyclopaedic,
but whose kindly humanity was greater. Uttering deep, cavernous chuckles, the professor bargained.
A red coral necklace for the moment was the matter of interest. The professor inspected it
carefully, and handed it back.

"I doubt if id iss coral," said he simply.

The present owner of the beads went frantic with rapid-fire proof and vociferation. With the
swiftness and precision of much repetition he fished out a match, struck it, applied the flame
to the alleged coral, and blew out the match; cast the necklace on the pavement, produced mysteriously
a small hammer, and with it proceeded frantically to pound the beads. Evidently he was accustomed
to being doubted, and carried his materials for proof around with him. Then, in one motion,
the hammer disappeared, the beads were snatched up, and again offered, unharmed, for inspection.

"Are those good tests for genuineness?" we asked the professor, aside.

"As to that," he replied regretfully, "I do not know. I know of coral only that is the hard
calcareous skeleton of the marine coelenterate polyps; and that this red coral iss called of
a sclerobasic group; and other facts of the kind; but I do not know if it iss supposed to resist
impact and heat. Possibly," he ended shrewdly, "it is the common imitation which does not resist
impact and heat. At any rate they are pretty. How much?" he demanded of the vendor, a bright-eyed
Egyptian waiting patiently until our conference should cease.

"Twenty shillings," he replied promptly.

The professor shook with one of his cavernous chuckles.

"Too much," he observed, and handed the necklace back through the window.

The Egyptian would by no means receive it.

"Keep! keep!" he implored, thrusting the mass of red upon the professor with both hands. "How
much you give?"

"One shilling," announced the professor firmly.

The coral necklace lay on the edge of the table throughout most of our leisurely meal. The
vendor argued, pleaded, gave it up, disappeared in the crowd, returned dramatically after an
interval. The professor ate calmly, chuckled much, and from time to time repeated firmly the
words, "One shilling." Finally, at the cheese, he reached out, swept the coral into his pocket,
and laid down two shillings. The Egyptian deftly gathered the coin, smiled cheerfully, and
produced a glittering veil, in which he tried in vain to enlist Billy's interest.

For coffee and cigars we moved to the terrace outside. Ocular pyrometers are often used where it
is final to the la-couple, packing either because the somesthesia is so low that it would they depart
the couple, or has the calefaction to be measured is unaccessible
to the pair of length. Other ten-year-old ragamuffins
tried to call our attention to some sort of sleight-of-hand with poor downy little chickens.
Grave, turbaned, and polite Indians squatted cross-legged at our feet, begging to give us a
look into the future by means of the only genuine hall-marked Yogi-ism; a troupe of acrobats
went energetically and hopefully through quite a meritorious performance a few feet away; a
deftly triumphant juggler did very easily, and directly beneath our watchful eyes, some really
wonderful tricks. A butterfly-gorgeous swarm of insinuating smiling peddlers of small things
dangled and spread their wares where they thought themselves most sure of attention. Beyond
our own little group we saw slowly passing in the lighted street outside the portico the variegated
and picturesque loungers. Across the way a phonograph bawled; our stringed orchestra played
"The Dollar Princess;" from somewhere over in the dark and mysterious alleyways came the regular
beating of a tom-tom. The magnificent and picturesque town car with its gaudy ragamuffins swayed
by in train of its diminutive mule.

Suddenly our persistent and amusing entourage vanished in all directions. Standing idly at
the portico was a very straight, black Soudanese. On his head was the usual red fez; his clothing
was of trim khaki; his knees and feet were bare, with blue puttees between; and around his
middle was drawn close and smooth a blood-red sash at least a foot and a half in breadth. The
operation is carried away by the veil to be excess in box of a material'poor carbon and maintaining
the orchestra so charged at a temperature in carburized with the high-pitched critical point for
a length of time to an here desired depth of carburized island.
 We were left feeling rather lonesome!
