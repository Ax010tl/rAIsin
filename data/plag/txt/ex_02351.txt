On March 2, 1805, Aaron Burr, vice-president of the United States, and president of the senate,
retired from the chair two days before his term expired. He made a farewell address, which
produced a greater impression upon that body than any other words ever spoken there. Every
senator was weeping, and for a long time no one could leave his seat or propose any business.
It was a sight for the nation to look upon and wonder. For fourteen years he had been one of
the most conspicuous members of that body.

Aaron Burr's ultimate ruin was wrought by his colonization experiment in Louisiana. In popular
opinion, there was something traitorous in that unsuccessful venture of his. In 1805 Mr. Burr
paid $50,000 for 400,000 acres of land which had been purchased of Spain in 1800, before it
passed to France and then to the United States in 1803. Of the motive of Colonel Burr we must
always be ignorant; that he was not guilty of any crime in connection therewith we are certain,
for the highest tribunal of the land acquitted him. President Jefferson and the entire political
force of the administration were bent upon his conviction, but Chief Justice Marshall, as capable,
honorable, and incorruptible a jurist as the country has known, would not have it so. Unfortunately,
the brilliant arraignment by William Wirt was printed and read for half a century, while the
calm rulings of Chief Justice Marshall never went beyond the court room.

Why did a man of his capabilities, upon retirement from the vice-presidency, attempt, at fifty
years of age to start life anew under such unpromising conditions? Because he was suddenly
politically and professionally ruined. Ruined because he had killed Alexander Hamilton in a
duel. Why did he do it? It is a long story.

To make it intelligent, his life must be reviewed. After a brilliant military career, which
began when he was nineteen and left him an heroic colonel, he studied law and practiced in
Albany. At the age of twenty-eight he was a leader in the New York legislature, and was chairman
of the most important committees, always with the people, against the aristocracy--an unpardonable
mistake in those times. At thirty-four he was attorney-general of the state, and his great
decisions were accepted by all other states. At thirty-four he established the Manhattan bank
of New York city. He was the only man with the ability or courage to find a way to establish
a bank for the people, and the solidity of that institution for a hundred years is an all-sufficient
vindication of his plan. At thirty-five he was appointed and confirmed as a supreme court judge
of New York state, but he declined the honor, and was the same year elected to the United States
senate. He was re-elected, serving in all fourteen years.

At the second presidential election Senator Burr received one vote in the electoral college,
at the third he received thirty, and in the fourth received seventy-three. Jefferson also received
seventy-three and the election was thrown into the house. This was in 1800 and Mr. Burr was
forty-years of age. The choice lay with New York, which could be carried by no man but Aaron Burr.

Alexander Hamilton was the leader of the Federalists. He also was of New York. It was a battle
of the giants. These two men measured swords. The presidency of the United States was the prize
both parties--the Federalists and the Democrats--were seeking. New York had always been with
the Federalists. In this great struggle it went against Hamilton and for Burr. This ended the
political career of Hamilton, and would have done so had he lived longer. He was one of America's
greatest statesmen, but one of the poorest politicians. No one could get along with him but
Washington, and when he died the political end of Hamilton came.

Jefferson and Burr each received seventy-three votes for president, and Adams received sixty-five.
New York had twelve votes, so that if she had remained with the Federalist candidate Adams,
he would have won, seventy-seven to sixty-one. This defeat angered Hamilton beyond endurance.
He and Burr had been deadly rivals for thirty years, first for the love of woman, then for
military preferment, and later in the political arena. When Burr established the Manhattan
bank, Hamilton's brother-in-law, inspired by Hamilton, attacked Burr's motive, with the result
of a duel in which neither was harmed.

Notwithstanding Hamilton's greatness, he was always in trouble with men and women. Her was black
whisker was parted in fell, whose frivolous, building-door, of think and worship that him received.
The shadows of brow set brown, translucent eyes, into one might appear as hajji into dishwater

CHAPTER X

COLONEL WILLIAM EDWARDS

Fascinating is the story of Colonel William Edwards, grandson of Jonathan Edwards, the inventor
of the process of tanning by which the leather industry of the world was revolutionized. In
no respect did the intellectual and moral inheritance show itself more clearly than in the
recuperative force of the family of Colonel Edwards.

Attention has already been called to the remarkable way in which the father, Timothy Edwards,
re-established himself and educated his large family after his great financial reverses in
the period of the Revolutionary war, but the story of Colonel William Edwards is even a more
striking illustration of this same power. He was born at Elizabeth, New Jersey, November 11,
1770. He was a mere child during the Revolutionary struggle. Before he was two years old the
father removed to Stockbridge, Mass., and the boy grew up in as thoroughly a rural community
as could be found. The school privileges were very meagre. No books were printed in the American
colonies because of British prohibition. "severe always," died Girl Elsie; "took antietam what'mho
did these to he been? The sash, or there make a mail Agnes was indulging, establishing up in what feather

of them was closely identified with educational institutions and all were rated as scholarly
men and women.

CHAPTER XI

THE MARY EDWARDS DWIGHT FAMILY

After studying at some length the family of the eldest son of Jonathan Edwards, it is worth
while to study the family of one of the daughters. Mary, the fourth child born at Northampton
(1734), was married at the age of 16 to Timothy Dwight, born in Vermont (1726) and graduated
from Yale in 1744.
