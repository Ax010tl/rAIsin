Even her husband's anger, when he returned from England, could not make her contemplate such
a step.  She had written and told him all about the matter from beginning to end, describing
the gamut of emotions through which she had passed--anxiety, suffering, terror, and dreadful
relief; and he had sympathized and seemed to understand, even applauding her action since the
sequel appeared so successful.

But, apparently, he had never fully realized the main fact of the bargain until he returned
to find that, while one little daughter was dainty and sweet under a nursemaid's care, the
other, dressed in the gaudy bandanas and bangles of a Malay child, gambolled in the back yard
or crawled in the kitchen among potato peelings and pumpkin pips. First aghast, then furious,
he brooded over the thing, held back by his terrified wife from making a move.  Then, at the
end of three days, he broke loose.

"It's an outrage!" he averred, and stamped to the back regions with his wife hanging to his
arm trying to stay him.  In the kitchen no sign of Rachel Bangat, but the child was sitting
in a small, rough-deal sugar-box, which served for waste and scraps, using it as a go-cart.
Amidst the debris of vegetable and fruit peelings, she sat gurgling and banging with a chunk
of pumpkin, while the other chubby hand held a half-eaten apple.  John Ozanne caught her up.

"Leave her, John; for God's sake, leave her!" pleaded his wife, white-faced.  At her words
a sound came from the scullery, and the cook bounded into the doorway and stood looking with
a dark eye.

"You take my baby?" she asked.  Perhaps it was the gentleness of her tone that made John Ozanne
stop to explain that it was not fitting for an Englishman's child to be dragged up in a kitchen,
and that the thing could not go on any longer.

  Indeed, her conversation was of the most desultory description,
and Kitty gleaned little more news of her than she had already found in the morning newspaper.
Between detached snatches of talk, the girl fell into long moments of moody silence, and even
tea and cigarettes did not unknit her brow or loose her tongue.  Kitty, who not only expected
to be entertained about the dance but had also excellent reasons for supposing she should hear
something very exciting and important about Rosanne herself, was vaguely troubled and disappointed.
At last she ventured a gentle feeler.

"What about Sir Denis, Nan?"

Rosanne turned a thoughtful gaze on her, and this time a little of her old mockery glimmered in it.

"He still survives."

"Don't be silly, darling.  Len heard this morning at the club--what everyone is saying--you
know--how much he is in love with you, and that he's sure to propose soon."

"Don't mean to marry him!"  Kitty Drummund's lips fell apart and all the dancing excitement

"But you care for him, Rosanne!"
