From Geneva the young adventurers hurried to Nantes, on the coast of France, where Gallatin
soon received letters from his family, who seem to have neglected nothing that could contribute
to their comfort or advantage. Monsieur P. M. Gallatin, the guardian of Albert, a distant relative
in an elder branch of the family, addressed him a letter which, in its moderation, dignity,
and kindness, is a model of well-tempered severity and reproach. It expressed the pain Mademoiselle
Pictet had felt at his unceremonious departure, and his own affliction at the ingratitude of
one to whom he had never refused a request. Finally, as the trustee of his estate till his
majority, the guardian assures the errant youth that he will aid him with pecuniary resources
as far as possible, without infringing upon the capital, and within the sworn obligation of
his trust. Letters of recommendation to distinguished Americans were also forwarded, and in
these it is found, to the high credit of the family, that no distinction was made between the
two young men, although Serre seems to have been considered as the originator of the bold move.
The intervention of the Duke de la Rochefoucauld d'Enville was solicited, and a letter was
obtained by him from Benjamin Franklin--then American minister at the Court of Versailles--to
his son-in-law, Richard Bache. Lady Juliana Penn wrote in their behalf to John Penn at Philadelphia,
and Mademoiselle Pictet to Colonel Kinloch, member of the Continental Congress from South Carolina.
Thus supported in their undertaking the youthful travelers sailed from L'Orient on May 27,
in an American vessel, the Kattie, Captain Loring. Of the sum which Gallatin, who supplied
the capital for the expedition, brought from Geneva, one half had been expended in their land
journey and the payment of the passages to Boston; one half, eighty louis d'or--the equivalent
of four hundred silver dollars--remained, part of which they invested in tea. Reaching the
American coast in a fog, or bad weather, they were landed at Cape Ann on July 14. From Gloucester
they rode the next day to Boston on horseback, a distance of thirty miles. Here they put up
at a French café, "The Sign of the Alliance," in Fore Street, kept by one Tahon, and began
to consider what step they should next take in the new world.

The prospects were not encouraging; the military fortunes of the struggling nation were never
at a lower ebb than during the summer which intervened between the disaster of Camden and the
discovery of Arnold's treason. Washington's army lay at New Windsor in enforced inactivity;
enlistments were few, and the currency was almost worthless. Such was the stagnation in trade,
that the young strangers found it extremely difficult to dispose of their little venture in
tea. Two months were passed at the café, in waiting for an opportunity to go to Philadelphia,
where Congress was in session, and where they expected to find the influential persons to whom
they were accredited; also letters from Geneva. But this journey was no easy matter. The usual
routes of travel were interrupted. New York was the fortified headquarters of the British army,
and the Middle States were only to be reached by a détour through the American lines above
the Highlands and behind the Jersey Hills.

 The trade of Machias was wholly in fish, lumber, and furs, which, there being no money,
the settlers were ready enough to barter for West India goods. But the outlet for the product
of the country was, in its unsettled condition, uncertain and precarious, and the young traders
were no better off than before. One transaction only is remembered, the advance by Gallatin
to the garrison of supplies to the value of four hundred dollars; for this he took a draft
on the state treasury of Massachusetts, which, there being no funds for its payment, he sold
at one fourth of its face value.

The life, rude as it was, was not without its charms. Serre seems to have abandoned himself
to its fascination without a regret. His descriptive letters to Badollet read like the "Idylls
of a Faun." Those of Gallatin, though more tempered in tone, reveal quiet content with the
simple life and a thorough enjoyment of nature in its original wildness. In the summer they
followed the tracks of the moose and deer through the primitive forests, and explored the streams
and lakes in the light birch canoe, with a woodsman or savage for their guide. In the winter
they made long journeys over land and water on snowshoes or on skates, occasionally visiting
the villages of the Indians, with whom the Lesderniers were on the best of terms, studying
their habits and witnessing their feasts. Occasional expeditions of a different nature gave
zest and excitement to this rustic life. These occurred when alarms of English invasion reached
the settlement, and volunteers marched to the defence of the frontier. Twice Gallatin accompanied
such parties to Passamaquoddy, and once, in November, 1780, was left for a time in command
of a small earthwork and a temporary garrison of whites and Indians at that place. At Machias
Gallatin made one acquaintance which greatly interested him, that of La Pérouse, the famous
navigator. He was then in command of the Amazone frigate, one of the French squadron on the
American coast, and had in convoy a fleet of fishing vessels on their way to the Newfoundland
banks. Gallatin had an intense fondness for geography, and was delighted with La Pérouse's
narrative of his visit to Hudson's Bay, and of his discovery there (at Fort Albany, which he
captured) of the manuscript journal of Samuel Hearne, who some years before had made a voyage
to the Arctic regions in search of a northwest passage. Gallatin and La Pérouse met subsequently
in Boston.

The winter of 1780-81 was passed in the cabin of the Lesderniers. The excessive cold does not
seem to have chilled Serre's enthusiasm. Like the faun of Hawthorne's mythical tale, he loved
Nature in all her moods; but Gallatin appears to have wearied of the confinement and of his
uncongenial companions. The trading experiment was abandoned in the autumn, and with some experience,
but a reduced purse, the friends returned in October to Boston, where Gallatin set to work
to support himself by giving lessons in the French language. What success he met with at first
is not known, though the visits of the French fleet and the presence of its officers may have
awakened some interest in their language. However this may be, in December Gallatin wrote to
his good friend, Mademoiselle Pictet, a frank account of his embarrassments. Before it reached
her, she had already, with her wonted forethought, anticipated his difficulties by providing
for a payment of money to him wherever he might be, and had also secured for him the interest
of Dr. Samuel Cooper, whose grandson, young Johannot, was then at school in Geneva. Dr. Cooper
was one of the most distinguished of the patriots in Boston, and no better influence could
have been invoked than his. In July, 1782, by a formal vote of the President and Fellows of
Harvard College, Mr. Gallatin was permitted to teach the French language. About seventy of
the students availed themselves of the privilege. Mr. Gallatin received about three hundred
dollars in compensation. In this occupation he remained at Cambridge for about a year, at the
expiration of which he took advantage of the close of the academic course to withdraw from
his charge, receiving at his departure a certificate from the Faculty that he had acquitted
himself in his department with great reputation.

The war was over, the army of the United States was disbanded, and the country was preparing
for the new order which the peace would introduce into the habits and occupations of the people.
The long-sought opportunity at last presented itself, and Mr. Gallatin at once embraced it.
He left Boston without regret. He had done his duty faithfully, and secured the approbation
and esteem of all with whom he had come in contact, but there is no evidence that he cared
for or sought social relations either in the city or at the college. Journeying southward he
passed through Providence, where he took sail for New York. Stopping for an hour at Newport
for dinner, he reached New York on July 21, 1783. The same day the frigate Mercury arrived
from England with news of the signature of the definitive treaty of peace. He was delighted
with the beauty of the country-seats above the city, the vast port with its abundant shipping,
and with the prospect of a theatrical entertainment. The British soldiers and sailors, who
were still in possession, he found rude and insolent, but the returning refugees civil and
honest people. At Boston Gallatin made the acquaintance of a French gentleman, one Savary de
Valcoulon, who had crossed the Atlantic to prosecute in person certain claims against the State
of Virginia for advances made by his house in Lyons during the war. He accompanied Gallatin
to New York, and together they traveled to Philadelphia; Savary, who spoke no English, gladly
attaching to himself as his companion a young man of the ability and character of Gallatin.

At Philadelphia Gallatin was soon after joined by Serre, who had remained behind, engaged also
in giving instruction. The meeting at Philadelphia seems to have been the occasion for the
dissolution of a partnership in which Gallatin had placed his money, and Serre his enthusiasm
and personal charm. A settlement was made; Serre giving his note to Gallatin for the sum of
six hundred dollars,--one half of their joint expenses for three years,--an obligation which
was repaid more than half a century later by his sister. Serre then joined a fellow-countryman
and went to Jamaica, where he died in 1784. At Philadelphia Gallatin and Savary lodged in a
house kept by one Mary Lynn. Pelatiah Webster, the political economist, who owned the house,
was also a boarder. Later he said of his fellow-lodgers that "they were well-bred gentlemen
who passed their time conversing in French." Gallatin, at the end of his resources, gladly
acceded to Savary's request to accompany him to Richmond.

Whatever hesitation Gallatin may have entertained as to his definitive expatriation was entirely
set at rest by the news of strife between the rival factions in Geneva and the interposition
of armed force by the neighboring governments. This interference turned the scale against the
liberal party. Mademoiselle Pictet was the only link which bound him to his family. For his
ingratitude to her he constantly reproached himself. He still styled himself a citizen of Geneva,
but this was only as a matter of convenience and security to his correspondence. His determination
to make America his home was now fixed. The lands on the banks of the Ohio were then considered
the most fertile in America,--the best for farming purposes, the cultivation of grain, and
the raising of cattle. The first settlement in this region was made by the Ohio Company, an
association formed in Virginia and London, about the middle of the century, by Thomas Lee,
together with Lawrence and Augustine, brothers of George Washington. The lands lay on the south
side of the Ohio, between the Monongahela and Kanawha rivers. These lands were known as "Washington's
bottom lands." In this neighborhood Gallatin determined to purchase two or three thousand acres,
and prepare for that ideal country home which had been the dream of his college days. Land
here was worth from thirty cents to four dollars an acre. His first purchase was about one
thousand acres, for which he paid one hundred pounds, Virginia currency. Land speculation was
the fever of the time. Savary was early affected by it, and before the new friends left Philadelphia
for Richmond he bought warrants for one hundred and twenty thousand acres in Virginia, in Monongalia
County, between the Great and Little Kanawha rivers, and interested Gallatin to the extent
of one quarter in the purchase. Soon after the completion of this transaction the sale of some
small portions reimbursed them for three fourths of the original cost. This was the first time
when, and Savary was the first person to whom, Gallatin was willing to incur a pecuniary obligation.
Throughout his life he had an aversion to debt; small or large, private or public. It was arranged
that Gallatin's part of the purchase money was not to be paid until his majority,--January
29, 1786,--but in the meanwhile he was, in lieu of interest money, to give his services in
personal superintendence. Later Savary increased Gallatin's interest to one half. Soon after
these plans were completed, Savary and Gallatin moved to Richmond, where they made their residence.

In February, 1784, Gallatin returned to Philadelphia, perfected the arrangements for his expedition,
and in March crossed the mountains, and, with his exploring party, passed down the Ohio River
to Monongalia County in Virginia. The superior advantages of the country north of the Virginia
line determined him to establish his headquarters there. He selected the farm of Thomas Clare,
at the junction of the Monongahela River and George's Creek. This was in Fayette County, Pennsylvania,
about four miles north of the Virginia line. Here he built a log hut, opened a country store,
and remained till the close of the year. It was while thus engaged at George's Creek, in September
of the year 1784, that Gallatin first met General Washington, who was examining the country,
in which he had large landed interests, to select a route for a road across the Alleghanies.
The story of the interview was first made public by Mr. John Russell Bartlett, who had it from
the lips of Mr. Gallatin. The version of the late Hon. William Beach Lawrence, in a paper prepared
for the New York Historical Society, differs slightly in immaterial points. Mr. Lawrence says:--

     "Among the incidents connected with his (Mr. Gallatin's) earliest
     explorations was an interview with General Washington, which he
     repeatedly recounted to me. He had previously observed that of all
     the inaccessible men he had ever seen, General Washington was the
     most so. And this remark he made late in life, after having been
     conversant with most of the sovereigns of Europe and their prime
     ministers. He said, in connection with his office, he had a cot-bed
     in the office of the surveyor of the district when Washington, who
     had lands in the neighborhood, and was desirous of effecting
     communication between the rivers, came there. Mr. Gallatin's bed
     was given up to him,--Gallatin lying on the floor, immediately
     below the table at which Washington was writing. Washington was
     endeavoring to reduce to paper the calculations of the day.
     Gallatin, hearing the statement, came at once to the conclusion,
     and, after waiting some time, he himself gave the answer, which
     drew from Washington such a look as he never experienced before or
     since. On arriving by a slow process at his conclusion, Washington
     turned to Gallatin and said, 'You are right, young man.'"

The points of difference between the two accounts of this interview are of little importance.
The look which Washington is said to have given Mr. Gallatin has its counterpart in that with
which he is also said to have turned upon Gouverneur Morris, when accosted by him familiarly
with a touch on the shoulder. Bartlett, in his recollection of the anecdote, adds that Washington,
about this period, inquired after the forward young man, and urged him to become his land agent,--an
offer which Gallatin declined.

The winter of 1784-85 was passed in Richmond, in the society of which town Mr. Gallatin began
to find a relief and pleasure he had not yet experienced in America. At this period the Virginia
capital was the gayest city in the Union, and famous for its abundant hospitality, rather facile
manners, and the liberal tendency of its religious thought. Gallatin brought no prudishness
and no orthodoxy in his Genevese baggage. One of the last acts of his life was to recognize
in graceful and touching words the kindness he then met with:--

     "I was received with that old proverbial Virginia hospitality to
     which I know no parallel anywhere within the circle of my travels.
     It was not hospitality only that was shown to me. I do not know how
     it came to pass, but every one with whom I became acquainted
     appeared to take an interest in the young stranger. I was only the
     interpreter of a gentleman, the agent of a foreign house, that had
     a large claim for advances to the State, and this made me known to
     all the officers of government, and some of the most prominent
     members of the Legislature. It gave me the first opportunity of
     showing some symptoms of talent, even as a speaker, of which I was
     not myself aware. Every one encouraged me, and was disposed to
     promote my success in life. To name all those from whom I received
     offers of service would be to name all the most distinguished
     residents at that time in Richmond."

In the spring of 1785, fortified with a certificate from Governor Patrick Henry, commending
him to the county surveyor, and intrusted by Henry with the duty of locating two thousand acres
of lands in the western country for a third party, he set out from Richmond, on March 31, alone,
on horseback. Following the course of the James River he crossed the Blue Ridge at the Peaks
of Otter, and reached Greenbrier Court House on April 18. On the 29th he arrived at Clare's,
on George's Creek, where he was joined by Savary. Their surveying operations were soon begun,
each taking a separate course. An Indian rising broke up the operations of Savary, and both
parties returned to Clare's. Gallatin appeared before the court of Monongalia County, at its
October term, and took the "oath of allegiance and fidelity to the Commonwealth of Virginia." Had

 Friendship Hill
is one of the bluffs on the right bank of the river, and faces the Laurel Ridge to the eastward.
Braddock's Road, now the National Road, crosses the mountains, passing through Uniontown and
Red Stone Old Fort (Brownsville), on its course to Pittsburgh. The county seat of Fayette is
the borough of Union or Uniontown. Gallatin's log cabin, the beginning of New Geneva, was on
the right bank of the Monongahela, about twelve miles to the westward of the county seat. Opposite,
on the other side of the river, in Washington County, was Greensburg, where his friend Badollet
was later established.

Again for a long period Gallatin left his family without any word whatever. His most indulgent
friend, Mademoiselle Pictet, could hardly excuse his silence, and did not hesitate to charge
that it was due to misfortunes which his pride prompted him to conceal. In the early days of
1786 a rumor of his death reached Geneva, and greatly alarmed his family. Mr. Jefferson, then
minister at Paris, wrote to Mr. Jay for information. This was Jefferson's first knowledge of
the existence of the young man who was to become his political associate, his philosophic companion,
and his truest friend. Meanwhile Gallatin had attained his twenty-fifth year and his majority.
His family were no longer left in doubt as to his existence, and in response to his letters
drafts were at once remitted to him for the sum of five thousand dollars, through the banking-house
of Robert Morris. This was, of course, immediately applied to his western experiment. The business
of the partnership now called for his constant attention. It required the exercise of a great
variety of mental powers, a cool and discriminating judgment, combined with an incessant attention
to details. Nature, under such circumstances, is not so attractive as she appears in youthful
dreams; admirable in her original garb, she is annoying and obstinate when disturbed. The view
of country which Friendship Hill commands is said to rival Switzerland in its picturesque beauty,
but years later, when the romance of the Monongahela hills had faded in the actualities of
life, Gallatin wrote of it that "he did not know in the United States any spot which afforded
less means to earn a bare subsistence for those who could not live by manual labor."
