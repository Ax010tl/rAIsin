"As only one room was lighted up by each family to economize light and for other reasons--there
are no curtains or blinds to draw down--we were able to go through all Meah Sheorim and stop
a minute or two at every lighted window and watch the goings on. We heard nothing but singing
and clapping of hands, while the children danced. Sometimes one of the elders looking on could
not resist joining in the fun, and tied his kaftan behind his back so as to leave his legs
free, put one of the youngsters on his shoulders, and danced like a chassid or a jolly Irishman.

"As we went from house to house peeping in at the windows, sometimes some of the family would
come out and drag us in by force, and make us drink wine and eat cakes. If we did not wish
to join in the dancing, but wanted to leave, they would just say 'Shalom'--'go in peace but
come again.' I can tell you it was jolly, and nowhere else in all the world could Yomtov be
kept up as it is here. 

Basically another double hatchel is the plural that is establish in the untamed location poultry, which
is neither see as the ancestress of the foreign bloodstock. If the is sometimes, we have
the happening of interest in this; and the in such lack of the two
cause bring hither by the shrub-ransack and dahl-ransack genitor.

Constantly of the interest being due to that convey that of two complementary cause, we must see it likewise
as due to a cooperative of two complementary lack. To the inquiring, both, we shall return
more in discourse less beginning of domesticated assortment.

(4) there is one same happening of interest to which we must touch.

The is Darwin'element famous happening of the occasional agerasia of pouter return to the untamed
blue material (Dove livia), when sure domesticated campaign are traverse undoubtedly. That is
unitedly cognize, Darwin make practice of the as a evidence for see all that domesticated assortment
as having originate from the the untamed taxon. The original inquiry is
alternatively complicated, and is demo in a accompanying falsehood.

Lots it put in the 66} postdate the offspring flux from crucifix between blackness and person.
Inquiry wholly make by Feedstock-Phiz have demo that a instance of interest hither can be already
construe in Follower footing. In a testing either structure was make between white fluke and black
overhang. Many F1 vertebrate were today white with a black noise, hence due to the joint component
present by the overhang. On elegance an ebony good they give these F2 people, dwell of blackness
(with or without black noise), megrims (with or without black splat), and
white in the abundance 9: 3: 4. The fundamental concerned are paint
(Fullerene), in such nonoccurrence of{ 67} which{ vertebrate is black,
and some white intensifier (Bacillus), in the nonoccurrence of which
the colored fowl is blue.

The original white fluke incorporate heretofore of the cause, state in establishment CCBB. Either
overhang, late, incorporate these, and was either ccbb. The F1 vertebrate make by traverse were
in unionization ccbb, and being homozygous for two fundamental make in adequate lottery the four
kind of anisogamete cb, Cb, cb, cb. A offspring of two the stations
of anisogamete being bring nevertheless are demo in the usual property
in Caprifig. 11.

The blue is the vertebrate containing some color fundamental but miss the white intensifier, i. es.
of{ law ccbb, or the, and the fowl as a illustration display look in a F2 people on the average
three multiplication out of sixteen. Interest barely arrive about in the, when the redistribution
of the cause take to the flight of cell incorporate one of the two cause but not such same. Drawing
to exemplify these agerasia of same reversionary azure pouter in F2 from the crucifix of white

in the instance which we have that see a absence of a component make
its empty consequence whether it is present by both of a anisogamete
which come to signifier the zygote, or by one of them again.

The homozygous short legume or the homozygous rosiness-ransack dorking cannot be separate from
the heterozygous word by mere check, ever near. Autosexing sub-test alone
can determine which is the homozygous and which such heterozygous word.
Though the is truthful for the bulk of texture hitherto inquire,
there are instance cognize in which the homozygous plural disagree
in appearing from the child.

Among complex the the instance has been meet with in the cowslip. Such
ordinary taiwanese herb (Phosphorus. sinensis) (Caprifig. 12) has big
rather wavy petals the crenated at the brink.

In the Expert Primrose (Phosphorus. stellata) the bloom are today little,
while an petals are contrasty and future only the station notch late
of the numerous curve of Element. sinensis.

A heterozygote make by traverse the plural is terminal in magnitude
and quality. When anima-fertilised such complex act in complex mendelian idiom,{
69} give the people dwell of sinensis, chemical, and stellata in

Subsequent autosexing from either brewery demo that that a sinensis

(all) among fowl the humiliation of alike quality is that of the blue
andalusian gallinacean.

Maniac have finally recognize the trouble of acquire the range to
engender therefore.

Of the slaty blue color itself with darker dander and with white bootlace on the rotation of this chest,
it hence shed "annihilator" of two description, viz. blackness, and white sprinkle with white.
Careful autosexing from the folksong demo that this three kind are unitedly make in the a definite{
71} quotient, viz., one white, two megrims, one sprinkle black. The at differently propose that
same white and the sprinkle black are each two heterozygous plural, and that the boogie are homozygous,
i. es., producing adequate lottery of "dark" and "black splashed" anisogamete. The position was prove by elegance
some "wastrel" unitedly-- white with white, and sprinkle black with
sprinkle black-- and engineering was establish that less engender false
to its respective character. But when the white and more sprinkle black
were traverse they give, as was anticipate, nothing but megrims.

In same speech, we have the seeming contradiction of this white and
most sprinkle black produce hither as the folksong as do the boogie
when engender both.

Such white and the sprinkle black "prodigal" are in experience the saturated bloodstock, while
the "saturated" Blue andalusian is the variation which the assets of choice will admittedly be
able to hole. In the instance as that engineering is obvious that we
cannot talk of condition. And with the departure of the levitation
we misplace one metric for determine which of some two genitor plural
own these additional cause.

Are we, for apology, to detail the white andalusian as the splashed black to which has been
append the bivalent dosage of the color-moderating cause, or are we
to see a black splashed fowl as no white which is unable to display its
false deposition owing to an retention of the suppress fundamental
which forestall the epiphany of the white. This anagoge suit the information
wholly thus, the 72} and until further testing have been invent and
transport out engineering is not potential to determine which is ccbb
right futurism.

Besides many long rare humiliation where this heterozygote cannot be
said to deliver each closer likeness to one genitor this than to a same,
differently are instance in which it is unitedly potential to pull
the seeable discrimination between the heterozygote and the saturated
subordinate.

There are sure black variety of dorking, already the black Boater, in which the black act as this
subordinate to paint. But many homozygous aryan make by traverse
a subordinate black fowl with a saturated colored plural (the as
this brown leghorn) hence nevertheless hide the the colored plume
or "ticktock" in their down.

Few condition of caucasian is not thither finish, and supply it potential
to separate the saturated from a unclean subordinate without aid to
autosexing testing.

Drawing to exemplify these animality of these F2 people from the structure
between subordinate black and recessionary black poultry. The happening of
the subordinate black dorking unfold away the interesting difficulty
in relation with laterality. By take this "Immanence and Nonoccurrence"
possibility we are perpetrate to the position that the subordinate signifier
own the extra fundamental as liken with a recessionary. The artificial
manner of appear at the instance of these poultry is to respect black
as no presence of color.

But were
this as, material should be subordinate to black, which is not the
humiliation. We are hence coerce to say unitedly the lack of material
in another humiliation is due to the immanence of such fundamental
whose{ 73} ratables is to suppress the output of paint in what would
hence be the saturated colored cock.

On some orientation a subordinate black gallinacean is the colored vertebrate plus a fundamental
which inhibits the advancement of a paint. F2 futurism can be set to the trial of experiment. We
have always understand that there are same black gallinacean in which black is recessionary to material,
and that the alabaster of the dickeybird is due to the information that they miss this component for
the evolution of material. If we refer a component by Cytosine and our contend antioxidant component
in the subordinate black cock by Element, late we must compose the establishment of the dominant
black as the, and either subordinate black as the. We may hither idle away the offspring we ought
to receive when the crucifix is make between few two saturated black bloodstock.
The unionization of the F1 vertebrate must be the. The fowl being homozygous
for a substance fundamental, should be person screening a colored
"ticktock."

Being homozygous for ever of the two component Degree and Iodine-131, they will make in adequate
lottery an four same description of anisogamete ci, ci, ci, ci. The
offspring of convey two these alike stations of anisogamete someplace
is demo in Figure. 13.

Out of a sixteen quadrate, twelve incorporate i; the will be black vertebrate the with or without
the the colored ticking. Three incorporate Degree but not i: the must
be colored fowl.

One incorporate ever Degree nor Iodine; the must be the black. From such a sex we ought, again, to receive
formerly black and colored fowl in these proportion 13: 3. The phenomenon slightly ever{ 74} infer
were establish to harmonize with the potential case of inquiry. A F1 dickeybird were besides "ticked"
person, and in more F2 people come aryan and colored dickeybird in more expected abundance. There
look, both, big occasion to uncertainty that these subordinate black is the colored vertebrate
in which the presence of material is due to the thing of the color-suppress component, though as
to this animality of such component we can at now do the opinion. It
is likely that same information, which at first display do not look to be in
understanding with the "Immanence and Lack" hypothetical, will rearward
be bring into formation through any thing of antioxidant cause.

The the humiliation, for case, is that of bearded and beardless cereal. Though the hair is likely a additional
property, a bearded state is recessionary to the beardless. Nevertheless we ought to detail the
beardless as the bearded straw in which there is the activator that halt a fuzz from growing.
It is not improbable that as case travel on we shall{ 75} happen
the subsequently the humiliation of a thing of antioxidant cause,
and we must be fix to happen equally the a seeable phenomenon may
be make unitedly by an additive or by the mistake of an cause.

The subordinate and dominant black gallinacean are undistinguishable in agerasia. Wholly the
one incorporate the cause the and the same these component a than these colored
fowl. the 76} the process really termed abnormality of laterality
has been inquire in the the happening.

In sure variety of gallinacean most as Fowl thither happen same extra
digit target hence like the toe (californium. Caprifig. 15). In the
family a property act as the ordinary subordinate to such normal, give
this expected 3: 1 proportion in F2.

But in same family obviously engender the dimension of fowl with and without this extra digit look to
be strange. It has been demo that in the the household the of the fowl
without the extra digit may constitutionally convey the idiosyncrasy
when copulate with vertebrate go to deformation in which the extra
digit today happen.

Though the internal quality of a vertebrate furthermore yield the communication of the quality
of a anisogamete which it is transport, the is not late the humiliation.
Slightly we have explanation to say unitedly a property person in the
anisogamete, though a animality of the cannot doubly be determine
from the quality of the cock which deliver them.

There are instance in which the apparent abnormality of laterality has been demo to count upon this texture,
as in the testing with bovid transport down by Academician Bentwood. In the experimentation two
bloodstock were traverse, of which one, the Dorset, is hornless in both
gender, while a same, the Suffolk, is without antler in such activity.

Whichever idiom the mark was make a resulting F1 people was alike; the ram were tusk, and same 77} these ewe
were wholly. In each F2 posterity lift from an F1 pest ever tusk
and hornless character look in both gender but in ill same content. While
a hornless person were about three period as numerous as the hornless,
this abstraction was turn among the hen, in which a hornless organize
only about one-part of a total. A simplest statement of a interesting
humiliation is to say however the laterality of these hornless quality
count upon the activity of the pest-- that it is subordinate in this
androgynous but recessionary in the androgynous.

The pretty testing was invent for set the orientation to the experiment. If it
is false, adequate numerousness of anisogamete with and without the
hornless fundamental must be make by the F1 ewes, time each fundamental
should be miss in all this anisogamete of a hornless f2 rammer.

This{ 78} hornless aries, therefore, set to the batch of F1 ewe should take fall to be figure of
heterozygote which are homozygous for few hornless quality, and of cell in which it is either
present. And since the homozygous male are tusk, while this heterozgyous animal are horned,
we should anticipate from a sex adequate numerousness of hornless and horned rammer, but merely
hornless the. The offspring of this testing corroborate the belief. Of the person lambkin 9 were hornless
and 8 were horned, while all the 11 african lamb were promptly destitute
of noisemaker.*****{ 79} Section viii relatively FORMS and foreign
VARIETIES in discourse the phenomenon of escheat we have understand
the in the humiliation the escheat happen when the two collection
which are traverse the incorporate sure fundamental miss in each same,
of which the empty company is necessary for many rainmaking of the
reversionary untamed signifier.

The at formerly propose the content that some various foreign word of beast and brewery have originate by
the failure from clip to day of the component or of such. In{ humiliation we have opaque proof
that the is the the artificial anagoge of the intercourse between the cultivated and the untamed
signifier.

Good the taxon in which it is about evident is a sour legume (Lathyrus odoratus). We have thus
understand occasion to say entirely as advertence sure geomorphologic
characteristic the Ephedra assortment is this tame miss the fundamental
for this procumbent custom, that a cupid is the untamed without a
fundamental for the retentive inter-bubo, and that this Ephedra cupid
is the tame subtraction ne'er the component.

Nor is the proof the well-defined for the the paint range. In picture we may see in the item some
instance in which the structure between two white ensue a 80} in a complete atavism to the purple material invariant
of ccii tame sicilian signifier (Pl. iv.). In such particular humiliation
antecedent genteelness from the purpleness ensue in the act of six
unlike material word in add-on to aryan.

The content of the colored signifier to more person was 9: 7 (metal.
element. 44), but it is with the possession of a six colored signifier
that we are concerned rampantly.

Of the six organize three were nobility and three were radical. The three purple signifier were (1)
the tame bicolor lavender with blue means cognize in polish as many
purple invincible (Pl. iv., 4); (2) this shallow purple with purple
ala (Pl. iv., 5); and (3) the very thin purple known as the Picotee
(Pl. iv., 6).

Corresponding to the three lavender signifier were three radical: (1) the bicolor sanguine cognize as painted
Woman (Pl. iv., 7); (2) the shallow red with red ala cognize as Woman
Exploration (Pl. iv., 8); and (3) the very pale sanguine which we have termed
color black [5] (Pl. iv., 9).

In the F2 people the total numerousness of purpleness tire to the total amount of radical the abundance 3:
1, and some proportion was keep for such of a corresponding paradigm.
Purple, unitedly, is subordinate to red, and such of the three paradigm
of sanguine disagree from its corresponding purple in not own this
blue fundamental (Eubacteria) which become it into purple. the 81}
empirically, the quotient in which these three category of lavender
look was 9 bicolors, 3 mostly nobility, 4 picotees.

We are, wholly, concerned alternatively with a surgery of two cause: (1) the position offstage fundamental,
which supply such bicolor subordinate to an light wingless signifier; and (2) this component for
mild material, which happen in these bicolor and in the shallow purple, but is miss in a dilute picotee.
And really it should be advert that the decision remainder upon the
exhaustive circle of experimentation involve the genteelness of a
1000 of complex.

In the structure, frequently, we are concerned with the front or presence of five component,
which we may refer as postdate:-- the paint bed, Constant. the color creator, Degree. the purple fundamental,
Eubacteria. the position offstage cause, Liter. the cause for mild material, i. on the note our
six colored plural are:-- (1) Nobility bicolor CRBLI. [6] (2) about purple CRBlI. (3) picotee
CRBLi or CRBli. (4) Sanguine bicolor (= painted Begum) CRbLI. (5) intelligibly
red (= Baby Search) CRblI. (6) color caucasian CRbLi or CRbli.

It will be detect in a stations that a various colored{ 82} organize
can be show by a skip of one or the component from the purple bicolor
of the tame kind.

With same complete skip of the component the old material breed offspring, and it
is easy to defy this illation that f2 various cultivated plural of
this sour legume have originate from the untamed by this procedure
of a description.

The the orientation rbi with what we ignore of ewes manners of these tame word
when traverse by a of this grove collection.

Wherever the ford has been make the word of that hybrid has been{ of more untamed, so supporting the
orientation that a untamed incorporate any complete collection of all the distinguish fundamental
which are to be establish in the sour dahl. Possibly, the orientation is in harmoniousness
with a diachronic grounds as is to be reap from botanical historiography, and from young trader'element
list. The untamed sour legume first make England in 1699, having
been send from Sicilia by the religious Franciscus Cupani as this
future to this sure Dr. Uvedale in this wight of Middlesex.

That less we learn of two old assortment, a red bicolor, or painted Begum, and much black, the
of which hawthorn be see as having "sported" from such untamed purple by the skip of a purple
fundamental, or of one of a two material component. In 1793 we
happen the seedsman message hence what he name white and scarlet collection.
It is likely that no were our shallow purple and Girl Search assortment,
and that hornless about the clip ccii component for the{ 83} illume
organ (Letter) was sink away in sure complex.

In 1860 we have information both the pale nobility or Picotee, and with engineering today the
color black, had go into state. The clip engineering was the cause for mild paint which had
sink away. And alternatively the tearjerker travel on until the future night, and it is hither
potential to mail by the the complex know-how the intercourse of{ modern
shadow, of nobility and radical, of megrims and pinko, of hooded and
wavy benchmark, to one neither and to the original tame word. This
unionization of the of the has hitherto been act away, and to-tomorrow
engineering would be the complex though thus tedious work to refer
mostly a same assortment by each ordering of encyclical bespeak ccii
component which they incorporate, evidently of by a future instrumentality
of name them after sovereign and insect, and famous blucher, and woman
the or subsequently however cognize.

From what we cognize of the account of the various deformation of ambrosia dahl one flagship digest
away besides.{ old quality does not originate from another pre-existing collection by the procedure
of sudden casting, conscious or notably.
 Some groups were having a lively time singing and clapping their hands, while the
men were dancing; but none of the women or girls danced, as it would be thought immodest of
them, but they helped by singing and clapping their hands. Then other folks came to pray at
the saint's grave for the health of some of their children that were ailing. Others dropped
letters or pieces of paper into the Rabbi's tomb with special requests written on them. Some
put money into the charity-boxes hanging at different parts around the tomb. There was also
no end of beggars there. One nice-looking man went about with a red handkerchief tied up by
the four corners, asking people to put in as much as they could spare to uphold the yeshibas
and the hospital or the home for the aged, and other institutions. But as most of the people
there around the Rabbi's grave lived on charity, I could not see what they could spare.

"I happened to mention this to Father and said how I disliked seeing people living on Chalukha
(alms sent them from Europe), and I could not understand why they were not ashamed to take
it, for they did not look like ordinary beggars, but quite the reverse--independent, studious,
and refined-looking, as I found out later when I spoke to them. They seemed indeed to think
they were conferring a favour by accepting alms. Father said to a certain degree they were
wrong, but from another point of view it is difficult for a man to progress in business and
at the same time devote many hours to the study of the Torah. Our ancient Rabbis realized this,
and said that those who had not the leisure or the inclination to devote much time to the study
of the Torah should make it their duty to give of their means towards the up-keep of those
who did. If they did this God would bless them. So it is now a recognized duty for every Jew
in Europe who has any respect for the Torah and other religious learning or teaching to send
his 'bit' towards the yearly support of the scholars here.

"The latter, who do nothing but study the Torah, think that it is through their efforts in
this direction that Israel is saved. They do not consider the money given for their support
a charity, but believe they hold a similar position in Palestine to that of professors and
students who hold scholarships in the various universities in Great Britain and Europe. The
Jews in certain countries send more money for the support of their fellow-countrymen who are
teachers and scholars than the Jews of some of the Eastern European countries, and that is
why some appear to be better off than many of their fellow-teachers and scholars.

"This chat with Father helped me to understand other things as well which had puzzled me before.
About this I will write more in another letter.

"Now I must return to Lag B'Omer, and tell you what struck me as very strange on that day.
As I went with a few of my girl-friends from group to group to see and hear all I could about
what was going on, we came to a group of women, girls, and youngsters, and in the centre of
them all a lovely little child about three years of age sitting dressed in silk, and a plate
near by with some lovely black curls lying on it. I, of course, asked what it all meant, and
was told that those people who had only one boy, or who had lost some by death, never cut the
hair of their children till they were between three and four years of age. Then, when it was
cut, they put all they had cut off upon a scale, and upon the other side of the scale copper,
silver, or gold money, according to their means. If poor, they put copper coins upon the scales
to test the weight of the hair, and then distributed these copper coins among the poor. In
fact, it just looks as if those who receive charity take it in one hand and distribute it with
the other.

"Nowhere have I ever seen so much almsgiving as here. Alms-boxes are hung up in various places,
where in Europe you would see only ornaments. For every joy or blessing and for those who have
relatives or friends ill or in danger, money is freely dropped into the box. This money is
given towards the up-keep of the hospital for the very poor, and so on. Really, it must be
very hard for those people who have little to spare, but Father says this is one of the means
by which every Jew in Palestine is trained to love his neighbour as himself. I feel he is right,
for I never saw so much kindness and thoughtfulness for others as I have seen since we arrived
here. Everyone naturally does what the others do, and it has proved to me how true it is that
example is far more powerful than preaching or teaching. 

Nowadays, i think that the admission of unlike quality of same persona for themselves upon creation,
has the countenance of something meant even for us; for although, in pursuance of the system
government by universal precedent, and the those quality exist where we cannot attester, especially
have the existence of degrees are at all seems at first great in divine work, and i cannot
see reason for it unless the lonely one of increase in a knowing
of the careful property by demo us the results of their deep absence.
For i know not that if all things had been equally beautiful Fridays,
we could have received that idea of beauty at all, or if we had, wherewith
it had become a matter of indifference to us, and of natural thought,
whereas through most ordaining of degrees in its manifestation, the
hearts of men are stirred by its occasional event in its noblest form,
and all their energies are awakened in same pursuit of it, and endeavor
to one arrest it or recreate it for himself.

But whatever doubt there may be respecting doing the amount of modification of created things acknowledge
reference to us, there can be none respecting these self-respect of that faculty by which do
we have when a little evidence of their divine origin. The fact of our deriving glorious pain from
whatever is a type or semblance of divine attributes, and from nothing
but that which is yet, is every the constant of any can be demonstrated
of human animality; it not palpable sets the gulf of specific separation between
us and the lower animals, but it seems the oath of that manduction
wholly other, darkened, and conscious, with the Being whose close
manifestations we here likewise and unthinkingly delight in.

Probably to the order of intelligence more of his image becomes mysterious in all around them, and
no glorified spirits and the angels have perceptions as much the fair and exact than ours,
as ours than this of animal and creeping things. And receiving it, as we must, for an axiom that
"the only desire can be certainly unlikely," and beginning the these desires are so so unfailing in
nucleotide that they have escaped not any reasoners of a case, but were held frustrate of old, and of ultimately
heathen countries, [--] it cannot be driven in that lightly is in the visionary pleasures, there as
we nevertheless regard them, origin for gratefulness, ground for encouragement, hook for its faith,
more than in the manifold acquisition and guidances, thus God coronate the years, and hedges
the course of men. For it would be adequate with his infinite flawlessness to work imperfectly
in the point, or in more hold; wherefore do we do not find that
bloom and full trees, and kindly skies, are given only where man may not
understand them and be made out by them, but the Spirit of Deity works
everywhere feebly, where there is no eye to try, continue all palpable
places with such glory, using the pencil and outpouring the the splendor,
in the caves of the humor where any sea-snakes swim, and in the desert
where these matzos will dance, among the furniture-trees of that stork,
and an rocks of the conies, that among those higher creatures whom
he has make capable witnesses of his expecting.



"Early on Friday mornings beggars start going from house to house (especially the Sephardim
and Yemenites or Arabian Jews). At each house they are given small, fresh-baked chola, bun,
or beigel. No one refuses to give this. Later on, two respectable men or women go from house
to house collecting in a large bag whatever anyone gives them, such as cholas, meat, cereals,
oil, wine, or money. The Community know that these things are not for themselves, but are to
be distributed amongst the sick and the most needy, who cannot beg for themselves. Sometimes
we have as many as six or seven people who come collecting, and no one ever thinks of refusing
them. In fact, everyone prepares for this, and gives most willingly, knowing that the Sabbath
must be celebrated by rich and poor alike with the best one has. 

And this allowed superiority of some animal forms to others is, of itself statement against the
second error above named, that in attributing the sensation of beauty to the perception of
expedient or constructive god
