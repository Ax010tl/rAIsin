                       Translated from the German

                              Illustrated

PREFACE TO THE SIXTH EDITION.

The present is the best collected edition of the important  works of Schiller which is accessible
to readers in the  English language. Detached poems or dramas have been  translated at various
times since the first publication of  the original works; and in several instances these versions
have been incorporated into this collection.  Schiller was not less efficiently qualified by
nature for  an historian than for a dramatist.  He was formed to  excel in all departments
of literature, and the admirable lucidity of style and soundness and impartiality of judgment
displayed in his historical writings will not easily be surpassed, and will always recommend
them as popular expositions of the periods of which they treat.

Since the publication of the first English edition many corrections and improvements have been
made, with a view to rendering it as acceptable as possible to English readers; and, notwithstanding
the disadvantages of a translation, the publishers feel sure that Schiller will be heartily
acceptable to English readers, and that the influence of his writings will continue to increase.

THE HISTORY OF THE REVOLT OF THE NETHERLANDS was translated by Lieut. E. B. Eastwick, and originally
published abroad for students' use.  But this translation was too strictly literal for general
readers.  It has been carefully revised, and some portions have been entirely rewritten by
the Rev. A. J. W. Morrison, who also has so ably translated the HISTORY OF THE THIRTY YEARS WAR.

THE CAMP OF WALLENSTEIN was translated by Mr. James Churchill, and first appeared in "Frazer's
Magazine."  It is an exceedingly happy version of what has always been deemed the most untranslatable
of Schiller's works.

THE PICCOLOMINI and DEATH OF WALLENSTEIN are the admirable version of S. T. Coleridge, completed
by the addition of all those passages which he has omitted, and by a restoration of Schiller's
own arrangement of the acts and scenes.  It is said, in defence of the variations which exist
between the German original and the version given by Coleridge, that he translated from a prompter's
copy in manuscript, before the drama had been printed, and that Schiller himself subsequently
altered it, by omitting some passages, adding others, and even engrafting several of Coleridge's
adaptations.

WILHELM TELL is translated by Theodore Martin, Esq., whose well-known position as a writer,
and whose special acquaintance with German literature make any recommendation superfluous.

DON CARLOS is translated by R. D. Boylan, Esq., and, in the opinion of competent judges, the
version is eminently successful.  Mr. Theodore Martin kindly gave some assistance, and, it
is but justice to state, has enhanced the value of the work by his judicious suggestions.

The translation of MARY STUART is that by the late Joseph Mellish, who appears to have been
on terms of intimate friendship with Schiller. His version was made from the prompter's copy,
before the play was published, and, like Coleridge's Wallenstein, contains many passages not
found in the printed edition.  These are distinguished by brackets.  On the other hand, Mr.
Mellish omitted many passages which now form part of the printed drama, all of which are now
added.  The translation, as a whole, stands out from similar works of the time (1800) in almost
as marked a degree as Coleridge's Wallenstein, and some passages exhibit powers of a high order;
a few, however, especially in the earlier scenes, seemed capable of improvement, and these
have been revised, but, in deference to the translator, with a sparing hand.

THE MAID OF ORLEANS is contributed by Miss Anna Swanwick, whose translation of Faust has since
become well known.  It has been. carefully revised, and is now, for the first time, published
complete.

THE BRIDE OF MESSINA, which has been regarded as the poetical masterpiece of Schiller, and,
perhaps of all his works, presents the greatest difficulties to the translator, is rendered
by A. Lodge, Esq., M. A.  This version, on its first publication in England, a few years ago,
was received with deserved eulogy by distinguished critics.  To the present edition has been
prefixed Schiller's Essay on the Use of the Chorus in Tragedy, in which the author's favorite
theory of the "Ideal of Art" is enforced with great ingenuity and eloquence.

             HISTORY OF THE THIRTY YEARS' WAR IN GERMANY.

                             BOOK I.

From the beginning of the religious wars in Germany, to the peace of Munster, scarcely any
thing great or remarkable occurred in the political world of Europe in which the Reformation
had not an important share. Kindle all the peace was still rendered at array is effected torch reformation

  Had not Charles the Fifth, in the intoxication of success, made an attempt
on the independence of the German States, a Protestant league would scarcely have rushed to
arms in defence of freedom of belief; but for the ambition of the Guises, the Calvinists in
France would never have beheld a Conde or a Coligny at their head.  Without the exaction of
the tenth and the twentieth penny, the See of Rome had never lost the United Netherlands. 
Princes fought in self-defence or for aggrandizement, while religious enthusiasm recruited
their armies, and opened to them the treasures of their subjects.  Of the multitude who flocked
to their standards, such as were not lured by the hope of plunder imagined they were fighting
for the truth, while in fact they were shedding their blood for the personal objects of their
princes.

And well was it for the people that, on this occasion, their interests coincided with those
of their princes.  To this coincidence alone were they indebted for their deliverance from
popery.  Well was it also for the rulers, that the subject contended too for his own cause,

 A Spanish prince had no alternative but orthodoxy
or abdication.  The same restraint was imposed upon Austria by her Italian dominions, which
she was obliged to treat, if possible, with even greater indulgence; impatient as they naturally
were of a foreign yoke, and possessing also ready means of shaking it off.  In regard to the
latter provinces, moreover, the rival pretensions of France, and the neighbourhood of the Pope,
were motives sufficient to prevent the Emperor from declaring in favour of a party which strove
to annihilate the papal see, and also to induce him to show the most active zeal in behalf
of the old religion. These general considerations, which must have been equally weighty with
every Spanish monarch, were, in the particular case of Charles V., still further enforced by
peculiar and personal motives.  In Italy this monarch had a formidable rival in the King of
France, under whose protection that country might throw itself the instant that Charles should
incur the slightest suspicion of heresy.  Distrust on the part of the Roman Catholics, and
a rupture with the church, would have been fatal also to many of his most cherished designs.
Moreover, when Charles was first called upon to make his election between the two parties,
the new doctrine had not yet attained to a full and commanding influence, and there still subsisted
a prospect of its reconciliation with the old.  In his son and successor, Philip the Second,
a monastic education combined with a gloomy and despotic disposition to generate an unmitigated
hostility to all innovations in religion; a feeling which the thought that his most formidable
political opponents were also the enemies of his faith was not calculated to weaken.  As his
European possessions, scattered as they were over so many countries, were on all sides exposed
to the seductions of foreign opinions, the progress of the Reformation in other quarters could
not well be a matter of indifference to him.  His immediate interests, therefore, urged him
to attach himself devotedly to the old church, in order to close up the sources of the heretical
contagion.  Thus, circumstances naturally placed this prince at the head of the league which
the Roman Catholics formed against the Reformers.  The principles which had actuated the long
and active reigns of Charles V.  and Philip the Second, remained a law for their successors;
and the more the breach in the church widened, the firmer became the attachment of the Spaniards
to Roman Catholicism.

The German line of the House of Austria was apparently more unfettered; but, in reality, though
free from many of these restraints, it was yet confined by others.  The possession of the imperial
throne--a dignity it was impossible for a Protestant to hold, (for with what consistency could
an apostate from the Romish Church wear the crown of a Roman emperor?) bound the successors
of Ferdinand I.  to the See of Rome. Ferdinand himself was, from conscientious motives, heartily
attached to it.  Besides, the German princes of the House of Austria were not powerful enough
to dispense with the support of Spain, which, however, they would have forfeited by the least
show of leaning towards the new doctrines.  The imperial dignity, also, required them to preserve
the existing political system of Germany, with which the maintenance of their own authority
was closely bound up, but which it was the aim of the Protestant League to destroy.  If to
these grounds we add the indifference of the Protestants to the Emperor's necessities and to
the common dangers of the empire, their encroachments on the temporalities of the church, and
their aggressive violence when they became conscious of their own power, we can easily conceive
how so many concurring motives must have determined the emperors to the side of popery, and
how their own interests came to be intimately interwoven with those of the Roman Church.  As
its fate seemed to depend altogether on the part taken by Austria, the princes of this house
came to be regarded by all Europe as the pillars of popery.  The hatred, therefore, which the
Protestants bore against the latter, was turned exclusively upon Austria; and the cause became
gradually confounded with its protector.

But this irreconcileable enemy of the Reformation--the House of Austria --by its ambitious
projects and the overwhelming force which it could bring to their support, endangered, in no
small degree, the freedom of Europe, and more especially of the German States.  This circumstance
could not fail to rouse the latter from their security, and to render them vigilant in self-defence.
Their ordinary resources were quite insufficient to resist so formidable a power.  Extraordinary
exertions were required from their subjects; and when even these proved far from adequate,
they had recourse to foreign assistance; and, by means of a common league, they endeavoured
to oppose a power which, singly, they were unable to withstand.

But the strong political inducements which the German princes had to resist the pretensions
of the House of Austria, naturally did not extend to their subjects.  It is only immediate
advantages or immediate evils that set the people in action, and for these a sound policy cannot
wait. Ill then would it have fared with these princes, if by good fortune another effectual
motive had not offered itself, which roused the passions of the people, and kindled in them
an enthusiasm which might be directed against the political danger, as having with it a common
cause of alarm.

This motive was their avowed hatred of the religion which Austria protected, and their enthusiastic
attachment to a doctrine which that House was endeavouring to extirpate by fire and sword.
Their attachment was ardent, their hatred invincible.  Religious fanaticism anticipates even
the remotest dangers.  Enthusiasm never calculates its sacrifices. What the most pressing danger
of the state could not gain from the citizens, was effected by religious zeal.  For the state,
or for the prince, few would have drawn the sword; but for religion, the merchant, the artist,
the peasant, all cheerfully flew to arms.  For the state, or for the prince, even the smallest
additional impost would have been avoided; but for religion the people readily staked at once

 The sphere of his views became enlarged.  He began to calculate his own fate from that
of other nations of the same religious profession, and to make their cause his own.  Now for
the first time did princes venture to bring the affairs of other countries before their own
councils; for the first time could they hope for a willing ear to their own necessities, and
prompt assistance from others.  Foreign affairs had now become a matter of domestic policy,
and that aid was readily granted to the religious confederate which would have been denied
to the mere neighbour, and still more to the distant stranger.  The inhabitant of the Palatinate
leaves his native fields to fight side by side with his religious associate of France, against
the common enemy of their faith. The Huguenot draws his sword against the country which persecutes
him, and sheds his blood in defence of the liberties of Holland.  Swiss is arrayed against
Swiss; German against German, to determine, on the banks of the Loire and the Seine, the succession
of the French crown.  The Dane crosses the Eider, and the Swede the Baltic, to break the chains
which are forged for Germany.

It is difficult to say what would have been the fate of the Reformation, and the liberties
of the Empire, had not the formidable power of Austria declared against them.  This, however,
appears certain, that nothing so completely damped the Austrian hopes of universal monarchy,
as the obstinate war which they had to wage against the new religious opinions. Under no other
circumstances could the weaker princes have roused their subjects to such extraordinary exertions
against the ambition of Austria, or the States themselves have united so closely against the
common enemy. 

I matt-up more perplex than otherwise. "well we repel, and carry about harmfully-- it doesn't hurt

All the fruits of the victory of Muehlberg were lost again in the congress of Passau, and the
diet of Augsburg; and every scheme for civil and religious oppression terminated in the concessions
of an equitable peace.

The diet of Augsburg divided Germany into two religious and two political parties, by recognizing
the independent rights and existence of both.  Hitherto the Protestants had been looked on
as rebels; they were henceforth to be regarded as brethren--not indeed through affection, but
necessity.  By the Interim, the Confession of Augsburg was allowed temporarily to take a sisterly
place alongside of the olden religion, though only as a tolerated neighbour.

The doctrines of Luther for the first time received a positive sanction; and if they were trampled
under foot in Bavaria and Austria, they predominated in Saxony and Thuringia.  But the sovereigns
