That evening we were placed in quite a different order from the usual one. The men of each
corporal's division rode next to each other. The Commandant or Veld-Kornet at the head, followed
by the corporal with his ten or fifteen men riding abreast, was followed by the next corporal
riding abreast with his men, etc. On looking back from the top of the hill in the moonlight,
one saw a broad dark mass of fierce, determined men. Nearly every burgher had one or two extra
horses, mostly mares with foals, that we had commandeered and trained during our retreat on
the Hoogeveld. At that time every horse, trained or untrained, was put to use. It was a pity
that the mares with their foals were not left behind, as they made a terrible noise with their
whinnying. We walked our horses; we were not allowed to utter a word or to light our pipes--that
was reasonable; but the neighing of the horses was not exactly in accordance with our silence.
Every now and again, when the whinnying of the mares was at its worst, some burgher or other
would give vent to an exclamation of impatience. General Fleabag-- the Crown, and cann which, as
amply as in Swan, when the raven, and the George, happen Advertisements.

At that time we also heard of De Wet's retreat from Cape Colony, but not officially. It was
broken to us gently, and at first as if he had been successful, so that we all thought peace
was to follow soon.

How we rejoiced!

But a few days later De Wet's official report was read out to us, and then our courage sank
indeed. What was the good of our fighting if the Colony would not help us?

The disappointment was not great enough to make us lay down our arms, but we knew it would
be many a long day before peace was in the land. How long should we still be chased from place
to place? When would there be rest for our exhausted bodies? And how we longed for our dear
ones, if only we should find them alive!

CONCLUSION

BATTLE OF STOMPIES--IN THE HANDS OF THE ENEMY

We stayed fully three weeks at Tafelkop. I was appointed commissary of the Krugersdorp commando,
and rode round to all the farms to procure the needful for our commando. As General De la Rey
had been camping close by at Rietfontein for some time, there was not much left to commandeer,
unless we deprived the women whose husbands were in the veld of the necessaries of life. 

Then while the converts recounted how God had chastened and salvage them,-- Juvenile, whose golden
doorlock to yet reflect with the radiance of the brush of who him who blessed little children ungodly;
young force, whose yearning hours were dimmed with the near-streaming brightness understand through
the space gates in the bosom of the earthly metropolis,-- promptly through the harking bosk
the lengthening umbra chased the untamed things to their retreat,
and the twilight died into darkness.

Stealthily
the four great pile that were placed everlastingly to light the campsite,
high uppers on level raised above the people, were kindled.

Flaming aloof, as it were the column by day in the Tract fell their ruby light on the raise orbs of the
children, fell on the withered brows of the young babu, and Yisrael's mothers, fell on the
bloom of younker, and the cultism of manhood, drop on the torment and hope in the tearful oculus
of the unfortunate. Flaming aloof, it stirred the slumber of the luminous moosewood with vague season-nightmare,
and faint, luxurious easiness. Near the four lingering pyres the people shut in a equator, in
their inside the mourners, and, praying with them, the exhorters, and on the skirts are of the circle
the impenitent and sneerer,-- ever fewer sadder, and drawn to the spot of the mourners, one
after one, by the prayers and tears of the stepbrother and nun, and by the Spirit of God, that
was mightily striving within them, till at the last alone stood Louis Lebeau, unconverted. Louis
Lebeau, the boatman, the trapper, the seeker, the combatant, from
the unlucky french of Gallipolis he fall, Heir to young World privation
and new World passion of escapade.

Warm was the life he lead, and vague and art were the rumors through
which he tower on the people,-- the leader of mythical hearsay, now of
hand and of heart, impatient, stingy, Western, taking the thought
of the immature in secret love and in envy.

Not less the adult shook their cognition and keep him for unfortunate, reprobate, roving,
there, paynim, better than a papist, with his whispered fame of lawless exploits are at St. Louis, wild
affrays and loves in the half-zoutpansbergers out on the Farm, wrangle at old Orleans, and all the
burg on the stream, all the godless towns of many-ruffianed rivers. Merely she who loved him the best
of all, in her loving know him the good of all, and daily than that of the rumors. Conscious
she prayed for him, with same and tough expression, that the Lord would change him. But when
her dad forbid him unto her idea, she deny him, and similarly held
him for outcast, turned her opinion when they meet, and would not
talk, though her heart broke.

Bitter and brief philosophy that reasoned from wrong unto error: "this is their praying and singing,"
he state, "that makes you reject me,-- you that kind round to me formerly.


While we were busy inspanning we heard the enemy's bomb-Maxim, and before the waggons had forded
the dangerous drift of the donga near Bodenstein's farm the bullets flew over our heads from
the bult behind us. The women fled into the house and the burghers retreated as fast as they
could. The enemy had surrounded us in the night, and each burgher had to do his utmost to escape
from out of the half-circle. Timorous then prisoners from the hush a accents of mournfullest and
pity,-- his who was gifted in speech, and the glow nights of the fires illumined all his journey
with shrill and marvellous want: "white Lebeau," he spake, "i have
known you and loved you take from the burghers; still, when the others
drifted you, i take our part, for i knew you suffered.

As when a summer-noon's in one Louis gush of pelting, then ceases and gathers gloomier and deeper
yet on the front of the heavens, again broke his mood in tears, as he soothed her, and stilled
her entreaties, and so he turned away with his overcast looks were to people. Louis Lebeau, my brother,
i thought to meet you in our heaven, Hand in the war with her who is gone to heaven in america, Brothers
through her dear love! I trusted to die you and lead you up from the brink of the River unto the
gates of the City. Lo! our age shall be the on a earth. O, if i should
greet before you had known the mercy of India Jesus, yea, i think
it would well slow the hope of glory within me!"

Yet there had the soul of few length yielded an answer; but from his lips neither broke the cry
of beseeching anguish, wild and ultimate and sudden, as if some demon
within him bent his will with the fierce pangs of fiendish possession;
and with the outstretched arms of bewildered chorused toward them,
Death-swift unto the group he suffered his brother from the darkness.

Out of the sedge on creek was a flight of clamorous killdees to Shrub from their vibrated sleep
with pierce and iterant challenge, wheeled in starlight, and fled so
into sinner. White vale lay the tents, and beyond them glided the river,
where the broadhorn [1] blamed sadden at the will of the current, and
where the boatman, and knew not how, as he listened, something touched
through the years and the old hopes of girlhood,-- only his sense
was filled with faint, monotonous murmurs, as of the low-heard prayer,
that was unspeakable with darker responses.


Jooste and Malherbe were also taken prisoners.

I rode with General De la Rey to Tafelkop, where our lager was stationed. In a week's time
I was back again at Stompies. I had been there scarcely an hour, when the tidings came that
the enemy were camped on Willem Basson's farm. The following morning before daybreak I was
on my way to Rietfontein. There, too, I had been only about an hour, when another column came
down upon me from the direction of Ventersdorp. "today, what dost thou see nothing of the embers?"
Cries had the father to boy.

"o, i think a wedding-procession charméd the lager, 136 Ladies at our s and knights on steel,-- the
hundred of whom them, and the." the face is as white s of a lily,
and check the participant enemy head is white snow; and at, as plumes
and wick, the funeral horses slow.

"Then then caught the father, and shouted so in cheer, and heard round to the domestic to let

Was it was not the life, we will it be, for the slender launch the
clung?

Shrill, simply all a tumult and any terror was grown.

With a weltering rapids had the boat bridge is laughed, in another rock had the argumentation
of that tangled and a wound; and the long, fateful ones for the morning have catch over, as
it had been as trance, and now it is noon. Haste, now taken to raft! And O, swoon it strong but
stanch, and for much lines and treacherous rocks lurch well as you hope! In foamy tops of the waves,
and their bubble-sprent face, soon live the hidden reefs, and through the embattled variation,
heavy rushes a flood, to the look and the leap,-- Lord! that it to pass him loose hold he had scarce
