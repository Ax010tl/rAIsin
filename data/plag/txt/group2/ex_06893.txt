"To Charnwood, madam? It's unco late, and it's sax miles an' a bittock doun the water; I doubt
if we can find man and horse the night, mair especially as they hae mounted a sentinel before
the gate. Puir Cuddie! he's gane, puir fallow, that wad hae dune aught in the warld I bade
him, and ne'er asked a reason--an' I've had nae time to draw up wi' the new pleugh-lad yet;
forby that, they say he's gaun to be married to Meg Murdieson, illfaur'd cuttie as she is."

"You must find some one to go, Jenny; life and death depend upon it."

"I wad gang mysell, my leddy, for I could creep out at the window o' the pantry, and speel
down by the auld yew-tree weel eneugh--I hae played that trick ere now. Have not found the astrologers in the blue vault star before never seen, and
have not recognized that star Parsondes soul?

- That is true, "replied the king, but I have come to find out, by disclosing some Nanar Babylonians
disgruntled gentlemen, it, furious that claimed Parsondes against him, seven years has sent
emissaries to all parties to secretly take him and taken to his palace,
and there must be Parsondes, or dead, or suffering horrible torments.

-
Ah, sir!

I cried to the point, prostrate at the feet of the King, it is just an evil revenge dreadful.
Allow me to be the instrument of your revenge, and save my dear teacher the captivity in which, if
not dead, is.

The King told me that to this end had called me, and immediately prepare to leave with me the
support due, and his strict orders to answer me with your Nanar life
of the holy man, or his release.

That same day, which was one of the hottest of summer, I went to Susa in a chariot Arab drawn by
four horses. A skilled driver was addressed, and two Ethiopian slaves also accompanied me in
the car, with air on one with an ostrich feather fan, and holding the other on rich ivory varal,
neatly styled, the wide umbrella silk. Four riders, all quivers, bows and arrows, clothing and
covered mesh head with individual bronze helmets, gleaming colors Niel, I followed and gave me greater
authority and decorum. Six scouts, mounted zebra striped and lightning-fast, went before me, to
advertise in the various populations.

Victuals and drink that we brought to supplement the shortcomings of the way, came on the backs
of twenty powerful elephants.

Not to be too wordy, not referring here minutely the events of my trip. Suffice to know that
the tenth day we discovered in the distance the huge walls of Babylon, Nebuchadnezzar work and
Nitocris. They were thirty yards in thickness, surrounding the city, forming a zone twenty-two
leagues of circumnavigation, and rose, at the lowest hundred and twenty yards above the earth as
much as the bells of the cathedrals now. Crowned by a tuft of green walls. They were hanging
garden. On the walls and gardens stood out some buildings such as royal palaces, the temple of Belus
and the famous tower of Nimrod, which consisted eight-story, more than two hundred yards high
first. From the top of this tower, it seemed to touch the sky, presumed to treat the gods
sages, secret intelligences or spirits that move the stars. Although still far apart, and confusedly,
thought and to perceive the colossal figures carved and painted on exterior walls of palaces
and temples, those man-headed bulls and men with head lion, those heroes and those warriors, tight
girdles kidneys, that is Oliba Oala and fell in love. The sun reflected from the East on the
gigantic buildings and huge hundred gates of the city, which were of gilt bronze. The glow
given off dazzled eyes. The Euphrates and Tigris, winding and also
injured by lightning the sun shimmered in waves, resembled two gold
ribbons melt forming a loop.

The beaters had gone ahead to announce my arrival. Suddenly we saw up in the broad, fertile
plain between the orchards, gardens and green woods, where it was open the road, a white cloud
which went bigger. Then we saw a dark stain that moving towards us. Soon after came at a run
one of my scouts told me that Nanar approached to greet me with large party. In this dark spot
had enlarged exceedingly, and began to hear distinctly the sound of musical instruments, the
neighing of horses and the clatter of weapons. We note, finally,
the glow of gold and silver, luxury clothes and the magnificence of
those who came to greet us.
She then returned to persuade her young mistress to go to bed, and to lull her to rest, if
possible, with assurances of Gibbie's success in his embassy, only qualified by a passing regret
that the trusty Cuddie, with whom the commission might have been more safely reposed, was no
longer within reach of serving her.

More fortunate as a messenger than as a cavalier, it was Gibbie's good hap rather than his
good management, which, after he had gone astray not oftener than nine times, and given his
garments a taste of the variation of each bog, brook, and slough, between Tillietudlem and
Charnwood, placed him about daybreak before the gate of Major Bellenden's mansion, having completed
a walk of ten miles (for the bittock, as usual, amounted to four) in little more than the same
number of hours.

CHAPTER XI.

               At last comes the troop, by the word of command
               Drawn up in our court, where the Captain cries,
               Stand!
                                             Swift

Major Bellenden's ancient valet, Gideon Pike as he adjusted his master's clothes by his bedside,
preparatory to the worthy veteran's toilet, acquainted him, as an apology for disturbing him
an hour earlier than his usual time of rising, that there was an express from Tillietudlem.

"From Tillietudlem?" said the old gentleman, rising hastily in his bed, and sitting bolt upright,--"Open
the shutters, Pike--I hope my sister-in-law is well--furl up the bed-curtain.--What have we
all here?" (glancing at Edith's note.) "The gout? why, she knows I have not had a fit since
Candlemas.--The wappen-schaw? I told her a month since I was not to be there.--Paduasoy and
hanging sleeves? why, hang the gipsy herself!--Grand Cyrus and Philipdastus?--Philip Devil!--is
the wench gone crazy all at once? was it worth while to send an express and wake me at five
in the morning for all this trash?--But what says her postscriptum?--Mercy on us!" he exclaimed
on perusing it,--"Pike, saddle old Kilsythe instantly, and another horse for yourself."

"I hope nae ill news frae the Tower, sir?" said Pike, astonished at his master's sudden emotion.

"Yes--no--yes--that is, I must meet Claverhouse there on some express business; so boot and
saddle, Pike, as fast as you can.--O, Lord! what times are these!--the poor lad--my old cronie's
son!--and the silly wench sticks it into her postscriptum, as she calls it, at the tail of
all this trumpery about old gowns and new romances!"

In a few minutes the good old officer was fully equipped; and having mounted upon his arm-gaunt
charger as soberly as Mark Antony himself could have done, he paced forth his way to the Tower
of Tillietudlem.

On the road he formed the prudent resolution to say nothing to the old lady (whose dislike
to presbyterians of all kinds he knew to be inveterate) of the quality and rank of the prisoner
detained within her walls, but to try his own influence with Claverhouse to obtain Morton's
liberation.

"Being so loyal as he is, he must do something for so old a cavalier as I am," said the veteran
to himself; "and if he is so good a soldier as the world speaks of, why, he will be glad to
serve an old soldier's son. I never knew a real soldier that was not a frank-hearted, honest
fellow; and I think the execution of the laws (though it's a pity they find it necessary to
make them so severe) may be a thousand times better intrusted with them than with peddling
lawyers and thick-skulled country gentlemen."

Such were the ruminations of Major Miles Bellenden, which were terminated by John Gudyill (not
more than half-drunk) taking hold of his bridle, and assisting him to dismount in the roughpaved
court of Tillietudlem.

"Why, John," said the veteran, "what devil of a discipline is this you have been keeping? You
have been reading Geneva print this morning already."

"I have been reading the Litany," said John, shaking his head with a look of drunken gravity,
and having only caught one word of the Major's address to him; "life is short, sir; we are
flowers of the field, sir--hiccup--and lilies of the valley."

"Flowers and lilies? Why, man, such carles as thou and I can hardly be called better than old
hemlocks, decayed nettles, or withered rag-weed; but I suppose you think that we are still
worth watering."

"I am an old soldier, sir, I thank Heaven--hiccup"--

"An old skinker, you mean, John. But come, never mind, show me the way to your mistress, old lad."

John Gudyill led the way to the stone hall, where Lady Margaret was fidgeting about, superintending,
arranging, and re-forming the preparations made for the reception of the celebrated Claverhouse,
whom one party honoured and extolled as a hero, and another execrated as a bloodthirsty oppressor.

"Did I not tell you," said Lady Margaret to her principal female attendant--"did I not tell
you, Mysie, that it was my especial pleasure on this occasion to have every thing in the precise
order wherein it was upon that famous morning when his most sacred majesty partook of his disjune
at Tillietudlem?"

"Doubtless, such were your leddyship's commands, and to the best of my remembrance"--was Mysie
answering, when her ladyship broke in with, "Then wherefore is the venison pasty placed on
the left side of the throne, and the stoup of claret upon the right, when ye may right weel
remember, Mysie, that his most sacred majesty with his ain hand shifted the pasty to the same
side with the flagon, and said they were too good friends to be parted?"

"I mind that weel, madam," said Mysie; "and if I had forgot, I have heard your leddyship often
speak about that grand morning sin' syne; but I thought every thing was to be placed just as
it was when his majesty, God bless him, came into this room, looking mair like an angel than
a man, if he hadna been sae black-a-vised."

"Then ye thought nonsense, Mysie; for in whatever way his most sacred majesty ordered the position
of the trenchers and flagons, that, as weel as his royal pleasure in greater matters, should
be a law to his subjects, and shall ever be to those of the house of Tillietudlem."

"Weel, madam," said Mysie, making the alterations required, "it's easy mending the error; but
if every thing is just to be as his majesty left it, there should be an unco hole in the venison
pasty."

At this moment the door opened.

"Who is that, John Gudyill?" exclaimed the old lady. "I can speak to no one just now.--Is it
you, my dear brother?" she continued, in some surprise, as the Major entered; "this is a right
early visit."

"Not more early than welcome, I hope," replied Major Bellenden, as he saluted the widow of
his deceased brother; "but I heard by a note which Edith sent to Charnwood about some of her
equipage and books, that you were to have Claver'se here this morning, so I thought, like an
old firelock as I am, that I should like to have a chat with this rising soldier. I caused
Pike saddle Kilsythe, and here we both are." Then he plunged it fiercely through the bodice, all whole, all, all,
even hawks.

Gonzalo
said: - It is done!

And, casting a wave by mouth blackish desplomose.

His arms and legs shook for a moment, and his head and lifeless,
bent, side lay on the stone.

When looking at the plants spread to her lifeless body of his rival,
Ramiro submitted a short prayer to the Virgin of SoterraÃ±a. He avenged!

The source of pride spilled all over his body now a huge and brave enjoyment. Stand in the breeze
felt like a cock's comb, feather in his hat, and on the heels experienced a strange sense of invincible
power. Had wanted to launch, with all their voice, to the moon, the
battle cry of their elders. Assaulted by a sudden thought, he ducked into
the body, and undoing the laces, took from between the jacket and
the bloody shirt, a ticket without overwritten.

Unfolded. The clarity was weak, but looking to the sky, observed
that the moon was going to happen very soon after a crack in the clouds.

Shortly after his eyes read the following words: "Please your worship come tonight after eleven.
First hit three times and then two, very quietly, in the wicket.

I'll open. Cross the yard and garden and climb the tower wall. My lady will then talk to
your worship. "Your faithful servant, Alvarez." Tomos forehead with
both hands, was possible!

Is it true that Beatrice?

... Is there not some trick everything infamous mistress? It was easy to know. He held his
meditation, and, instantly, with nervous haste, changed his black
hat cap Gonzalo.

Then dragged the body to the edge of a cavity than black at the bottom
of the walls, stoutly empujolo foot for rolled to the bottom.

Then, collecting the clear layer of dead embozose with it, making
it a mess that pushed him under the arm.

As he prepared to jump back over the wall, he saw two faces looming behind dark. Was a thrill.
Were Medrano and Pablillo, who had witnessed the whole scene from there. Falling into the street,
the squire received him on his chest, exclaiming: - Famous thrust,
vote for Christ! Flee, flee quickly, lest the round again.

Ramiro ordenoles this time to rule that they would wait for the sun,
and giving them a coat and hat, stood up resolutely to the home of
Beatrice.

 The good old veteran was hurt at her appearance, which, in the hurry of preparation,
her grandmother had omitted to notice.

"What is come over you, you silly girl?" he said; "why, you look like an officer's wife when
she opens the News-letter after an action, and expects to find her husband among the killed
and wounded. But I know the reason--you will persist in reading these nonsensical romances,
day and night, and whimpering for distresses that never existed. Why, how the devil can you
believe that Artamines, or what d'ye call him, fought singlehanded with a whole battalion?
One to three is as great odds as ever fought and won, and I never knew any body that cared
to take that, except old Corporal Raddlebanes. But these d--d books put all pretty men's actions
out of countenance. I daresay you would think very little of Raddlebanes, if he were alongside
of Artamines.--I would have the fellows that write such nonsense brought to the picquet for
leasing-making."

     [Note:  Romances of the Seventeenth Century. As few, in the present
     age, are acquainted with the ponderous folios to which the age of
     Louis XIV. gave rise, we need only say, that they combine the
     dulness of the metaphysical courtship with all the improbabilities
     of the ancient Romance of Chivalry. Their character will be most
     easily learned from Boileau's Dramatic Satire, or Mrs Lennox's
     Female Quixote.]

Lady Margaret, herself somewhat attached to the perusal of romances, took up the cudgels. "Monsieur
Scuderi," she said, "is a soldier, brother; and, as I have heard, a complete one, and so is
the Sieur d'Urfe."

"More shame for them; they should have known better what they were writing about. For my part,
I have not read a book these twenty years except my Bible, The Whole Duty of Man, and, of late
days, Turner's Pallas Armata, or Treatise on the Ordering of the Pike Exercise, and I don't
like his discipline much neither.

     [Note:  Sir James Turner. Sir James Turner was a soldier of fortune,
     bred in the civil wars. He was intrusted with a commission to levy
     the fines imposed by the Privy Council for non-conformity, in the
     district of Dumfries and Galloway. In this capacity he vexed the
     country so much by his exactions, that the people rose and made him
     prisoner, and then proceeded in arms towards Mid-Lothian, where they
     were defeated at Pentland Hills, in 1666. Besides his treatise on
     the Military Art, Sir James Turner wrote several other works; the
     most curious of which is his Memoirs of his own Life and Times,
     which has just been printed, under the charge of the Bannatyne
     Club.]

He wants to draw up the cavalry in front of a stand of pikes, instead of being upon the wings.
Sure am I, if we had done so at Kilsythe, instead of having our handful of horse on the flanks,
the first discharge would have sent them back among our Highlanders.--But I hear the kettle-drums."

All heads were now bent from the battlements of the turret, which commanded a distant prospect
down the vale of the river. The Tower of Tillietudlem stood, or perhaps yet stands, upon the
angle of a very precipitous bank, formed by the junction of a considerable brook with the Clyde.

     [Note: The Castle of Tillietudlem is imaginary; but the ruins of
     Craignethan Castle, situated on the Nethan, about three miles from
     its junction with the Clyde, have something of the character of the
     description in the text]. We, the commoners and the nobility laughed in his face. We avenged ourselves
with talk of the holy life of Parsondes and countered it with the
life they led.

As things went, Arteo called me into his presence very early at daybreak.--There
is hope, he told me, that Parsondes is still alive, but if dead, it
is necessary to avenge and punish his killer, which can be no other,
than King Nanar.--Your wisdom, Sir, I answered, is like the light
that passes through and reveals all.


The view downwards is of a grand woodland character; but the level ground and gentle slopes
near the river form cultivated fields of an irregular shape, interspersed with hedgerow-trees
and copses, the enclosures seeming to have been individually cleared out of the forest which
surrounds them, and which occupies, in unbroken masses, the steeper declivities and more distant
banks. The stream, in colour a clear and sparkling brown, like the hue of the Cairngorm pebbles,
rushes through this romantic region in bold sweeps and curves, partly visible and partly concealed
by the trees which clothe its banks. With a providence unknown in other parts of Scotland,
the peasants have, in most places, planted orchards around their cottages, and the general
blossom of the appletrees at this season of the year gave all the lower part of the view the
appearance of a flower-garden.

Looking up the river, the character of the scene was varied considerably for the worse. 

Then, with verbosity sleepy, broken only by the harsh efforts to unload from time to time her
throat, saying fuel, according to recent findings, the Moors were preparing a general uprising throughout
the kingdom, and that it was necessary to surprise them with your
hands in the mass. - We have suspicions - he added - that in this
city there is a cache of conspirators, where rebels constantly receiving
messages of Aragon and Valencia.

But all this, Mr. Canon, we need to know for sure, as most City Council advocating for them, and abound
in Spain lords of title, not seeing their abandoned lands, they tend surreptitiously hand. He said after
the Board had entrusted Madrid, without regard to their age and ailments, this difficult mission,
he wanted to share with a churchman, whose special ministry will
put in a better position to know the qualities or defects of some
resident of the city.

His voice growing hoarse and lower then proceeded to explain the instructions that the canon was transmitted
to his agent. The same is drugged with his own speech. It was impossible to understand him. His words
faltered, became extinct. Then, spitting out one last time, bowed his head on his shoulder and fell
asleep. The lectoral not know what to do. The bolts were thrown and the oil lamp wicks rattled at
that point, threatening to shut down. There was, not a single book on the table, and he had forgotten
his breviary.

He thought then that there is no situation in existence that resists superior effort of philosophy
and, forgetting the circumstances and time, he began to contemplate the man of dark understanding
that had easily achieved high honors, to be one of the most influential individuals in the community,
had a great predicament by the King. His height was less than average, your back a little
jibosa, his red beard. There was a sadness all over her face comic buffoon. His lower lip stretched
out, shivering with lewd gesture. The lineage of the San Vicente was old in the city, though
not the most illustrious and lofty. Tore, however, a Maria de La Cerda and adorn your tree
Juan Mercado, first gentleman of Milan, Tomas de San Vicente, called
the Valiant, and, above all, Ruy Lopez de Avalos, Constable of Castile.

The gentlemen of his name could stand for remote privilege, in the transept of the church of Santa MarÃ­a
del Castillo Madrigal, facilitated by a chaplain of the Constable.
 The officers alone,
with their colours and an escort to guard them, were seen to take the steep road up to the
gate of the Tower, appearing by intervals as they gained the ascent, and again hidden by projections
of the bank and of the huge old trees with which it is covered. When they emerged from this
narrow path, they found themselves in front of the old Tower, the gates of which were hospitably
open for their reception. Lady Margaret, with Edith and her brother-in-law, having hastily
descended from their post of observation, appeared to meet and to welcome their guests, with
a retinue of domestics in as good order as the orgies of the preceding evening permitted. The
gallant young cornet (a relation as well as namesake of Claverhouse, with whom the reader has
been already made acquainted) lowered the standard amid the fanfare of the trumpets, in homage
to the rank of Lady Margaret and the charms of her grand-daughter, and the old walls echoed
to the flourish of the instruments, and the stamp and neigh of the chargers.

     [Note:  John Grahame of Claverhouse. This remarkable person united
     the seemingly inconsistent qualities of courage and cruelty, a
     disinterested and devoted loyalty to his prince, with a disregard of
     the rights of his fellow-subjects. He was the unscrupulous agent of
     the Scottish Privy Council in executing the merciless severities of
     the government in Scotland during the reigns of Charles II. and
     James II.; but he redeemed his character by the zeal with which he
     asserted the cause of the latter monarch after the Revolution, the
     military skill with which he supported it at the battle of
     Killiecrankie, and by his own death in the arms of victory.

     It is said by tradition, that he was very desirous to see, and be
     introduced to, a certain Lady Elphinstoun, who had reached the
     advanced age of one hundred years and upwards. The noble matron,
     being a stanch whig, was rather unwilling to receive Claver'se, (as
     he was called from his title,) but at length consented. After the
     usual compliments, the officer observed to the lady, that having
     lived so much beyond the usual term of humanity, she must in her
     time have seen many strange changes. "Hout na, sir," said Lady
     Elphinstoun, "the world is just to end with me as it began. When I
     was entering life, there was ane Knox deaving us a' wi' his clavers,
     and now I am ganging out, there is ane Claver'se deaving us a' wi'
     his knocks."

     Clavers signifying, in common parlance, idle chat, the double pun
     does credit to the ingenuity of a lady of a hundred years old.]

Claverhouse himself alighted from a black horse, the most beautiful perhaps in Scotland. He
had not a single white hair upon his whole body, a circumstance which, joined to his spirit
and fleetness, and to his being so frequently employed in pursuit of the presbyterian recusants,
caused an opinion to prevail among them, that the steed had been presented to his rider by
the great Enemy of Mankind, in order to assist him in persecuting the fugitive wanderers. When
Claverhouse had paid his respects to the ladies with military politeness, had apologized for
the trouble to which he was putting Lady Margaret's family, and had received the corresponding
assurances that she could not think any thing an inconvenience which brought within the walls
of Tillietudlem so distinguished a soldier, and so loyal a servant of his sacred majesty; when,
in short, all forms of hospitable and polite ritual had been duly complied with, the Colonel
requested permission to receive the report of Bothwell, who was now in attendance, and with
whom he spoke apart for a few minutes. 

Steel weapons crossed, Gonzalo masterfully halted the blows, lying
in wait for the moment.

Ramiro, in turn, deployed showy, military style fencing with fantastic twirls the sword above his
head and his mouth, slightly open yearning for murder displayed his glittering
teeth.

"I did not know," said Edith, hesitating very much, "whether it would be quite--quite proper
for me to"--"I know what you would say--whether it would be right to take any interest in a
presbyterian. But I knew this lad's father well. Looking at his right the suburb of Santiago, Vinolé
to mind his cohabitation with the beautiful Moorish and thought that this woman had been the
cause of all their misfortune, for all its faults and disappointments. Who knows if there was no
