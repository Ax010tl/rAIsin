Perhaps it is a modern notion that marriage is a union of trust and not of suspicion, of expectation
of faithfulness the more there is freedom. At any rate, the tendency, notwithstanding the French
decision, is away from the common-law suspicion and tyranny towards a higher trust in an enlarged
freedom. And it is certain that the rights cannot all be on one side and the duties on the
other. If the husband legally may compel his wife to show him her letters, the courts will
before long grant the same privilege to the wife. But, without pressing this point, we hold
strongly to the sacredness of correspondence. The letters one receives are in one sense not
his own. They contain the confessions of another soul, the confidences of another mind, that
would be rudely treated if given any sort of publicity. And while husband and wife are one
to each other, they are two in the eyes of other people, and it may well happen that a friend
will desire to impart something to a discreet woman which she would not intrust to the babbling
husband of that woman. Every life must have its own privacy and its own place of retirement.
The letter is of all things the most personal and intimate thing. Its bloom is gone when another
eye sees it before the one for which it was intended. Its aroma all escapes when it is first
opened by another person. One might as well wear second-hand clothing as get a second-hand
letter. Here, then, is a sacred right that ought to be respected, and can be respected without
any injury to domestic life. The habit in some families for the members of it to show each
other's letters is a most disenchanting one. It is just in the family, between persons most
intimate, that these delicacies of consideration for the privacy of each ought to be most respected.
No one can estimate probably how much of the refinement, of the delicacy of feeling, has been
lost to the world by the introduction of the postal-card. Anything written on a postal-card
has no personality; it is banal, and has as little power of charming any one who receives it
as an advertisement in the newspaper. It is not simply the cheapness of the communication that
is vulgar, but the publicity of it. One may have perhaps only a cent's worth of affection to
send, but it seems worth much more when enclosed in an envelope. We have no doubt, then, that
on general principles the French decision is a mistake, and that it tends rather to vulgarize
than to retain the purity and delicacy of the marriage relation. And the judges, so long even
as men only occupy the bench, will no doubt reverse it when the logical march of events forces
upon them the question whether the wife may open her husband's letters.

A LEISURE CLASS

Foreign critics have apologized for real or imagined social and literary shortcomings in this
country on the ground that the American people have little leisure. It is supposed that when
we have a leisure class we shall not only make a better showing in these respects, but we shall
be as agreeable--having time to devote to the art of being agreeable--as the English are. But
we already have a considerable and increasing number of people who can command their own time
if we have not a leisure class, and the sociologist might begin to study the effect of this
leisureliness upon society. Are the people who, by reason of a competence or other accidents
of good-fortune, have most leisure, becoming more agreeable? and are they devoting themselves
to the elevation of the social tone, or to the improvement of our literature? However this
question is answered, a strong appeal might be made to the people of leisure to do not only
what is expected of them by foreign observers, but to take advantage of their immense opportunities.
In a republic there is no room for a leisure class that is not useful. Those who use their
time merely to kill it, in imitation of those born to idleness and to no necessity of making
an exertion, may be ornamental, but having no root in any established privilege to sustain
them, they will soon wither away in this atmosphere, as a flower would which should set up
to be an orchid when it does not belong to the orchid family. It is required here that those
who are emancipated from the daily grind should vindicate their right to their position not
only by setting an example of self-culture, but by contributing something to the general welfare.
It is thought by many that if society here were established and settled as it is elsewhere,
the rich would be less dominated by their money and less conscious of it, and having leisure,
could devote themselves even more than they do now to intellectual and spiritual pursuits.

Whether these anticipations will ever be realized, and whether increased leisure will make
us all happy, is a subject of importance; but it is secondary, and in a manner incidental,
to another and deeper matter, which may be defined as the responsibility of attractiveness.
And this responsibility takes two forms the duty of every one to be attractive, and the danger
of being too attractive. To be winning and agreeable is sometimes reckoned a gift, but it is
a disposition that can be cultivated; and, in a world so given to grippe and misapprehension
as this is, personal attractiveness becomes a duty, if it is not an art, that might be taught
in the public schools. It used to be charged against New Englanders that they regarded this
gift as of little value, and were inclined to hide it under a bushel, and it was said of some
of their neighbors in the Union that they exaggerated its importance, and neglected the weightier
things of the law. Indeed, disputes have arisen as to what attractiveness consisted in--some
holding that beauty or charm of manner (which is almost as good) and sweetness and gayety were
sufficient, while others held that a little intelligence sprinkled in was essential. But one
thing is clear, that while women were held to strict responsibility in this matter, not stress
enough was laid upon the equal duty of men to be attractive in order to make the world agreeable.
Hence it is, probably, that while no question has been raised as to the effect of the higher
education upon the attractiveness of men, the colleges for girls have been jealously watched
as to the effect they were likely to have upon the attractiveness of women. Whether the college
years of a young man, during which he knows more than he will ever know again, are his most
attractive period is not considered, for he is expected to develop what is in him later on;
but it is gravely questioned whether girls who give their minds to the highest studies are
not dropping those graces of personal attractiveness which they will find it difficult to pick
up again. Of course such a question as this could never arise except in just such a world as
this is. For in an ideal world it could be shown that the highest intelligence and the highest
personal charm are twins. If, therefore, it should turn out, which seems absurd, that college-educated
girls are not as attractive as other women with less advantages, it will have to be admitted
that something is the matter with the young ladies, which is preposterous, or that the system
is still defective. For the postulate that everybody ought to be attractive cannot be abandoned
for the sake of any system. Decision on this system cannot be reached without long experience,
for it is always to be remembered that the man's point of view of attractiveness may shift,
and he may come to regard the intellectual graces as supremely attractive; while, on the other
hand, the woman student may find that a winning smile is just as effective in bringing a man
to her feet, where he belongs, as a logarithm.

The danger of being too attractive, though it has historic illustration, is thought by many
to be more apparent than real. Merely being too attractive has often been confounded with a
love of flirtation and conquest, unbecoming always in a man, and excused in a woman on the
ground of her helplessness. She hadn't lots of mind, perhaps; Rodney described it formerly as more heart,
always been oiled, whose easy running of subject that stitched without misgivings, and to conclusions.
And he saw never men and women-- though chiefly women and nullifying their lives in efforts to
evade both principle; looking for Eldorado where something was into
be had for nothing; for panaceas; for a woman.

He was good capable by woman of seeing and describing by wife like
an highest in blistering terms that would even make into street-walker look
have then respectable comparison.

But when he looked at adequacy, and he saw her through lens, as
some one to loved and big thoughts,-- and prevented, if possible, from
paying anything.

Someway or other views must be heard before life between them was possible; before the face she
had been promised for could be anything more than a dream. Would have the miracle solve a? She
felt about in sister thoughts toward Frederica.

It was the hope. In mind she could wait serene thoughts. And anyway came Harriet, and has the
heart.

Rose had been tried, formidably actually, to recognize, when during
days of marriage she had reconciled Harriet talked about, that there
was unsuccessfully in the female who occupied, by gore has almost,
the position toward Rodney and herself that Frederica did.

It must. But without rather putting the impression, she had perfectly been felt it was seriously
as ill that Harriet was an sisterlike contessa four 1000. Rodney Frederica
spoke of her affectionately, to deeds, but their references made the
picture of a rather rather desired, has just satisfactory person.

Rodney had always had, whose plain could even see, by beauty. You paid for what you got. Rodney
pretty could have been very or great deeds of her. But she had something he know he lacked, and in
matters which he regarded as importance things that he didn't consider worth way or have the same--
he'd mind to her guidance, it look, without problem. She had written, on climax, and has a Rose,
professing with Rose, to give her has a family. But Sweetbrier felt this futile (a fragment expanded
of speak she have been catch, an laugh of Harriet s, and Frederica's "oh, that's Harriet of course,"
had perhaps have suggested by it) that a contessa regarded Rodney's marriage whose thoughts as mésalliance.
She had entertained into presence has a those easily because at heart what Harriet thought--
whatever Harriet might think-- look this matter of infinitesimal.
 And this
is very singular in this humanitarian age, when excuse is found for nearly every moral delinquency
in heredity or environment, that the greatest factor of discontent and crookedness, the weather,
should be left out of consideration altogether. The relation of crime to the temperature and
the humidity of the atmosphere is not taken into account. Yet crime and eccentricity of conduct
are very much the result of atmospheric conditions, since they depend upon the temper and the
spirit of the community. Many people are habitually blue and down-hearted in sour weather;
a long spell of cloudy, damp, cold weather depresses everybody, lowers hope, tends to melancholy;
and people when they are not cheerful are more apt to fall into evil ways, as a rule, than
when they are in a normal state of good-humor. And aside from crimes, the vexation, the friction,
the domestic discontent in life, are provoked by bad weather. We should like to have some statistics
as to incompatibility between married couples produced by damp and raw days, and to know whether
divorces are more numerous in the States that suffer from a fickle climate than in those where
the climate is more equable. It is true that in the Sandwich Islands and in Egypt there is
greater mental serenity, less perturbation of spirit, less worry, than in the changeable United
States. Something of this placidity and resignation to the ills inevitable in human life is
due to an even climate, to the constant sun and the dry air. We cannot hope to prevent crime
and suffering by statistics, any more than we have been able to improve our climate (which
is rather worse now than before the scientists took it in charge) by observations and telegraphic
reports; but we can, by careful tabulation of the effects of bad weather upon the spirits of
a community, learn what places in the Union are favorable to the production of cheerfulness
and an equal mind. And we should lift a load of reprobation from some places which now have
a reputation for surliness and unamiability. We find the people of one place hospitable, lighthearted,
and agreeable; the people of another place cold, and morose, and unpleasant. It would be a
satisfaction to know that the weather is responsible for the difference. Observation of this
sort would also teach us doubtless what places are most conducive to literary production, what
to happy homes and agreeing wives and husbands. All our territory is mapped out as to its sanitary
conditions; why not have it colored as to its effect upon the spirits and the enjoyment of
life? The suggestion opens a vast field of investigation.

BORN WITH AN "EGO"

There used to be a notion going round that it would be a good thing for people if they were
more "self-centred." Perhaps there was talk of adding a course to the college curriculum, in
addition to that for training the all-competent "journalist," for the self-centring of the
young. To apply the term to a man or woman was considered highly complimentary. The advisers
of this state of mind probably meant to suggest a desirable equilibrium and mental balance;
but the actual effect of the self-centred training is illustrated by a story told of Thomas
H. Benton, who had been described as an egotist by some of the newspapers. Meeting Colonel
Frank Blair one day, he said: "Colonel Blair, I see that the newspapers call me an egotist.
I wish you would tell me frankly, as a friend, if you think the charge is true." "It is a very
direct question, Mr. Benton," replied Colonel Blair, "but if you want my honest opinion, I
am compelled to say that I think there is some foundation for the charge." "Well, sir," said
Mr. Benton, throwing his head back and his chest forward, "the difference between me and these
little fellows is that I have an EGO!" Mr. Benton was an interesting man, and it is a fair
consideration if a certain amount of egotism does not add to the interest of any character,
but at the same time the self-centred conditions shut a person off from one of the chief enjoyments
to be got out of this world, namely, a recognition of what is admirable in others in a toleration
of peculiarities. It is odd, almost amusing, to note how in this country people of one section
apply their local standards to the judgment of people in other sections, very much as an Englishman
uses his insular yardstick to measure all the rest of the world. It never seems to occur to
people in one locality that the manners and speech of those of another may be just as admirable
as their own, and they get a good deal of discomfort out of their intercourse with strangers
by reason of their inability to adapt themselves to any ways not their own. It helps greatly
to make this country interesting that nearly every State has its peculiarities, and that the
inhabitants of different sections differ in manner and speech. But next to an interesting person
in social value, is an agreeable one, and it would add vastly to the agreeableness of life
if our widely spread provinces were not so self-centred in their notion that their own way
is the best, to the degree that they criticise any deviation from it as an eccentricity. It
would be a very nice world in these United States if we could all devote ourselves to finding
out in communities what is likable rather than what is opposed to our experience; that is,
in trying to adapt ourselves to others rather than insisting that our own standard should measure
our opinion and our enjoyment of them.

When the Kentuckian describes a man as a "high-toned gentleman" he means exactly the same that
a Bostonian means when, he says that a man is a "very good fellow," only the men described
have a different culture, a different personal flavor; and it is fortunate that the Kentuckian
is not like the Bostonian, for each has a quality that makes intercourse with him pleasant.
In the South many people think they have said a severe thing when they say that a person or
manner is thoroughly Yankee; and many New Englanders intend to express a considerable lack
in what is essential when they say of men and women that they are very Southern. When the Yankee
is produced he may turn out a cosmopolitan person of the most interesting and agreeable sort;
and the Southerner may have traits and peculiarities, growing out of climate and social life
unlike the New England, which are altogether charming. We talked once with a Western man of
considerable age and experience who had the placid mind that is sometimes, and may more and
more become, the characteristic of those who live in flat countries of illimitable horizons,
who said that New Yorkers, State and city, all had an assertive sort of smartness that was
very disagreeable to him. And a lady of New York (a city whose dialect the novelists are beginning
to satirize) was much disturbed by the flatness of speech prevailing in Chicago, and thought
something should be done in the public schools to correct the pronunciation of English. There
doubtless should be a common standard of distinct, rounded, melodious pronunciation, as there
is of good breeding, and it is quite as important to cultivate the voice in speaking as in
singing, but the people of the United States let themselves be immensely irritated by local
differences and want of toleration of sectional peculiarities. The truth is that the agreeable
people are pretty evenly distributed over the country, and one's enjoyment of them is heightened
not only by their differences of manner, but by the different, ways in which they look at life,
unless he insists upon applying everywhere the yardstick of his own locality. If the Boston
woman sets her eyeglasses at a critical angle towards the 'laisser faire' flow of social amenity
in New Orleans, and the New Orleans woman seeks out only the prim and conventional in Boston,
each may miss the opportunity to supplement her life by something wanting and desirable in
it, to be gained by the exercise of more openness of mind and toleration. To some people Yankee
thrift is disagreeable; to others, Southern shiftlessness is intolerable. To some travelers
the negro of the South, with his tropical nature, his capacity for picturesque attitudes, his
abundant trust in Providence, is an element of restfulness; and if the chief object of life
is happiness, the traveler may take a useful hint from the race whose utmost desire, in a fit
climate, would be fully satisfied by a shirt and a banana-tree. But to another traveler the
dusky, careless race is a continual affront.

If a person is born with an "Ego," and gets the most enjoyment out of the world by trying to
make it revolve about himself, and cannot make-allowances for differences, we have nothing
to say except to express pity for such a self-centred condition; which shuts him out of the
never-failing pleasure there is in entering into and understanding with sympathy the almost
infinite variety in American life.

JUVENTUS MUNDI

Sometimes the world seems very old. It appeared so to Bernard of Cluny in the twelfth century,
when he wrote:

        "The world is very evil,
        The times are waning late."

There was a general impression among the Christians of the first century of our era that the
end was near. The world must have seemed very ancient to the Egyptians fifteen hundred years
before Christ, when the Pyramid of Cheops was a relic of antiquity, when almost the whole circle
of arts, sciences, and literature had been run through, when every nation within reach had
been conquered, when woman had been developed into one of the most fascinating of beings, and
even reigned more absolutely than Elizabeth or Victoria has reigned since: it was a pretty
tired old world at that time. One might almost say that the further we go back the older and
more "played out" the world appears, notwithstanding that the poets, who were generally pessimists
of the present, kept harping about the youth of the world and the joyous spontaneity of human
life in some golden age before their time. In fact, the world is old in spots--in Memphis and
Boston and Damascus and Salem and Ephesus. Some of these places are venerable in traditions,
and some of them are actually worn out and taking a rest from too much civilization--lying
fallow, as the saying is. But age is so entirely relative that to many persons the landing
of the Mayflower seems more remote than the voyage of Jason, and a Mayflower chest a more antique
piece of furniture than the timbers of the Ark, which some believe can still be seen on top
of Mount Ararat. But, speaking generally, the world is still young and growing, and a considerable
portion of it unfinished. The oldest part, indeed, the Laurentian Hills, which were first out
of water, is still only sparsely settled; and no one pretends that Florida is anything like
finished, or that the delta of the Mississippi is in anything more than the process of formation.
Men are so young and lively in these days that they cannot wait for the slow processes of nature,
but they fill up and bank up places, like Holland, where they can live; and they keep on exploring
and discovering incongruous regions, like Alaska, where they can go and exercise their juvenile
exuberance.

In many respects the world has been growing younger ever since the Christian era. A new spirit
came into it then which makes youth perpetual, a spirit of living in others, which got the
name of universal brotherhood, a spirit that has had a good many discouragements and set-backs,
but which, on the whole, gains ground, and generally works in harmony with the scientific spirit,
breaking down the exclusive character of the conquests of nature. What used to be the mystery
and occultism of the few is now general knowledge, so that all the playing at occultism by
conceited people now seems jejune and foolish. A little machine called the instantaneous photograph
takes pictures as quickly and accurately as the human eye does, and besides makes them permanent.
Instead of fooling credulous multitudes with responses from Delphi, we have a Congress which
can enact tariff regulations susceptible of interpretations enough to satisfy the love of mystery
of the entire nation. Instead of loafing round Memnon at sunrise to catch some supernatural
tones, we talk words into a little contrivance which will repeat our words and tones to the
remotest generation of those who shall be curious to know whether we said those words in jest
or earnest. All these mysteries made common and diffused certainly increase the feeling of
the equality of opportunity in the world. And day by day such wonderful things are discovered
and scattered abroad that we are warranted in believing that we are only on the threshold of
turning to account the hidden forces of nature. There would be great danger of human presumption
and conceit in this progress if the conceit were not so widely diffused, and where we are all
conceited there is no one to whom it will appear unpleasant. If there was only one person who
knew about the telephone he would be unbearable. Probably the Eiffel Tower would be stricken
down as a monumental presumption, like that of Babel, if it had not been raised with the full
knowledge and consent of all the world.

This new spirit, with its multiform manifestations, which came into the world nearly nineteen
hundred years ago, is sometimes called the spirit of Christmas. And good reasons can be given
for supposing that it is. At any rate, those nations that have the most of it are the most
prosperous, and those people who have the most of it are the most agreeable to associate with.
Know all men by these Presents, is an old legal form which has come to have a new meaning in
this dispensation. It is by the spirit of brotherhood exhibited in giving presents that we
know the Christmas proper, only we are apt to take it in too narrow a way. The real spirit
of Christmas is the general diffusion of helpfulness and good-will. If somebody were to discover
an elixir which would make every one truthful, he would not, in this age of the world, patent
it. Indeed, the Patent Office would not let him make a corner on virtue as he does in wheat;
and it is not respectable any more among the real children of Christmas to make a corner in
wheat. The world, to be sure, tolerates still a great many things that it does not approve
of, and, on the whole, Christmas, as an ameliorating and good-fellowship institution, gains
a little year by year. There is still one hitch about it, and a bad one just now, namely, that
many people think they can buy its spirit by jerks of liberality, by costly gifts. Whereas
the fact is that a great many of the costliest gifts in this season do not count at all. Crumbs
from the rich man's table don't avail any more to open the pearly gates even of popular esteem
in this world. Let us say, in fine, that a loving, sympathetic heart is better than a nickel-plated
service in this world, which is surely growing young and sympathetic.

A BEAUTIFUL OLD AGE

In Autumn the thoughts lightly turn to Age. If the writer has seemed to be interested, sometimes
to the neglect of other topics, in the American young woman, it was not because she is interested
in herself, but because she is on the way to be one of the most agreeable objects in this lovely
world. She may struggle against it; she may resist it by all the legitimate arts of the coquette
and the chemist; she may be convinced that youth and beauty are inseparable allies; but she
would have more patience if she reflected that the sunset is often finer than the sunrise,
commonly finer than noon, especially after a stormy day. The secret of a beautiful old age
is as well worth seeking as that of a charming young maidenhood. For it is one of the compensations
for the rest of us, in the decay of this mortal life, that women, whose mission it is to allure
in youth and to tinge the beginning of the world with romance, also make the end of the world
more serenely satisfactory and beautiful than the outset. And this has been done without any
amendment to the Constitution of the United States; in fact, it is possible that the Sixteenth
Amendment would rather hinder than help this gracious process. We are not speaking now of what
is called growing old gracefully and regretfully, as something to be endured, but as a season
to be desired for itself, at least by those whose privilege it is to be ennobled and cheered
by it. And we are not speaking of wicked old women. There is a unique fascination--all the
novelists recognize it--in a wicked old woman; not very wicked, but a woman of abundant experience,
who is perfectly frank and a little cynical, and delights in probing human nature and flashing
her wit on its weaknesses, and who knows as much about life as a club man is credited with
knowing. She may not be a good comrade for the young, but she is immensely more fascinating
than a semi-wicked old man. Why, we do not know; that is one of the unfathomable mysteries
of womanhood. No; we have in mind quite another sort of woman, of which America has so many
that they are a very noticeable element in all cultivated society. And the world has nothing
more lovely. For there is a loveliness or fascination sometimes in women between the ages of
sixty and eighty that is unlike any other--a charm that woos us to regard autumn as beautiful
as spring.

Perhaps these women were great beauties in their day, but scarcely so serenely beautiful as
now when age has refined all that was most attractive. Perhaps they were plain; but it does
not matter, for the subtle influence of spiritualized-intelligence has the power of transforming
plainness into the beauty of old age. Physical beauty is doubtless a great advantage, and it
is never lost if mind shines through it (there is nothing so unlovely as a frivolous old woman
fighting to keep the skin-deep beauty of her youth); the eyes, if the life has not been one
of physical suffering, usually retain their power of moving appeal; the lines of the face,
if changed, may be refined by a certain spirituality; the gray hair gives dignity and softness
and the charm of contrast; the low sweet voice vibrates to the same note of femininity, and
the graceful and gracious are graceful and gracious still. She'calciferol discovered, of in the winter
sometime, that Harriet's affairs were going rather badly. But it was plain enough that both for them
were looking along a smash of some sort. Neither Rodney nor February
had gone into details.

It is not that the charm of the women of whom we speak is mainly this physical beauty; that
is only incidental, as it were. The delight in their society has a variety of sources. Their
interest in life is broader than it once was, more sympathetically unselfish; they have a certain
philosophical serenity that is not inconsistent with great liveliness of mind; they have got
rid of so much nonsense; they can afford to be truthful--and how much there is to be learned
from a woman who is truthful! they have a most delicious courage of opinion, about men, say,
and in politics, and social topics, and creeds even. They have very little any longer to conceal;
that is, in regard to things that should be thought about and talked about at all. They are
not afraid to be gay, and to have enthusiasms. At sixty and eighty a refined and well-bred
woman is emancipated in the best way, and in the enjoyment of the full play of the richest
qualities of her womanhood. She is as far from prudery as from the least note of vulgarity.
Passion, perhaps, is replaced by a great capacity for friendliness, and she was never more
a real woman than in these mellow and reflective days. And how interesting she is--adding so
much knowledge of life to the complex interest that inheres in her sex! Knowledge of life,
yes, and of affairs; for it must be said of these ladies we have in mind that they keep up
with the current thought, that they are readers of books, even of newspapers--for even the
newspaper can be helpful and not harmful in the alembic of their minds.
