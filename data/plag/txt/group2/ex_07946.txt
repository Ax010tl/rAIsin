 Respected sirs! Pray enter! The performance
is about to begin! Free!"--he was shouting in a cracked voice.--"Hey there! Champagne! Bang!
In the forehead! On the ceiling! Akh, thou rascal, Paul de Kock!"--Luckily, he did not catch
sight of me, and I hastily beat a retreat.

I shall not dilate, gentlemen, on my amazement at the sight of such a change. And, as a matter
of fact, how could that peaceable, modest lad suddenly turn into a tipsy good-for-nothing?
Was it possible that all this had been concealed within him since his childhood, and had immediately
come to the surface as soon as the weight of parental authority had been removed from him?--And
that he had kicked up a dust in Moscow, as he had expressed it, there could be no possible
doubt, either. I had seen rakes in my day; but here something frantic, some frenzy of self-extermination,
some sort of recklessness, had made itself manifest!

III

This diversion lasted for two months.... And lo! again I am standing at the window of the drawing-room
and looking out into the courtyard.... Suddenly--what is this?... Through the gate with quiet
step enters a novice.... His conical cap is pulled down on his brow, his hair is combed smoothly
and flows from under it to right and left ... he wears a long cassock and a leather girdle....
Can it be Mísha? It is!

I go out on the steps to meet him.... "What is the meaning of this masquerade?" I ask.

"It is not a masquerade, uncle," Mísha answers me, with a deep sigh;--"but as I have squandered
all my property to the last kopék, and as a mighty repentance has seized upon me, I have made
up my mind to betake myself to the Tróitzko-Sérgieva Lávra,[9] to pray away my sins. For what
asylum is now left to me?... And so I have come to bid you farewell, uncle, like the Prodigal
Son...."

I gazed intently at Mísha. Abdulka appear yet with spirit which do he begins; a shoulder and those himself
presume it. It is as if my eager perceiver, into adjuration, there was put of man to secular feeling,
and of brush were growing Company to workman and workman diversion for

And Mísha dug and dug, inquiring from time to time: "Life isn't worth living, is it, Timoféi?"

"It is not, dear little father."

The hole had already grown fairly deep. People saw Mísha's work and ran to report about it
to the speculator-owner. At first the speculator flew into a rage, and wanted to send for the
police. "What hypocrisy!" he said. But afterward, reflecting, probably, that it would be inconvenient
to have a row with that lunatic, and that a scandal might be the result, he betook himself
in person to the churchyard, and approaching the toiling Mísha, he made a polite obeisance
to him. The latter continued to dig, as though he had not noticed his successor.

"Mikhaíl Andréitch," began the speculator, "permit me to inquire what you are doing there?"

"As you see--I am digging a grave for myself."

"Why are you doing that?"

"Because I do not wish to live any longer."

The speculator fairly flung apart his hands in surprise.--"You do not wish to live?"

Mísha cast a menacing glance at the speculator:--"Does that surprise you? Are not you the cause
of it all?... Is it not you?... Is it not thou?...[15] Is it not thou, Judas, who hast robbed
me, by taking advantage of my youth? Dost not thou skin the peasants? Is it not thou who hast
deprived this decrepit old man of his daily bread? Is it not thou?... O Lord! Everywhere there
is injustice, and oppression, and villainy.... So down with everything,--and with me also!
I don't wish to live--I don't wish to live any longer in Russia!"--And the spade made swifter
progress than ever in Mísha's hands.

"The devil knows the meaning of this!" thought the speculator: "he actually is burying himself."--"Mikhaíl
Andréitch,"--he began afresh, "listen; I really am guilty toward you; people did not represent
you properly to me."

Mísha went on digging.

"But why this recklessness?"

Mísha went on digging--and flung the dirt on the speculator, as much as to say: "Take that,
earth-devourer!"

"Really, you have no cause for this. Will not you come to my house to eat and rest?"

Mísha raised his head a little. "Now you're talking! And will there be anything to drink?"

The speculator was delighted.--"Good gracious!... I should think so!"

"And dost thou invite Timoféi also?"

"But why ... well, I invite him also."

Mísha reflected.--"Only look out ... for thou didst turn me out of doors.... Don't think thou
art going to get off with one bottle!"

"Do not worry ... there will be as much as you wish of everything."

Mísha flung aside his spade.... "Well, Timósha," he said, addressing his old man-nurse, "let
us honour the host.... Come along!"

"I obey," replied the old man.

And all three wended their way toward the house.

The speculator knew with whom he had to deal. Mísha made him promise as a preliminary, it is
true, that he would "allow all privileges" to the peasants;--but an hour later that same Mísha,
together with Timoféi, both drunk, danced a gallopade through those rooms where the pious shade
of Andréi Nikoláitch seemed still to be hovering; and an hour later still, Mísha, so sound
asleep that he could not be waked (liquor was his great weakness), was placed in a peasant-cart,
together with his kazák cap and his dagger, and sent off to the town, five-and-twenty versts
distant,--and there was found under a fence.... Well, and Timoféi, who still kept his feet
and merely hiccoughed, was "pitched out neck and crop," as a matter of course. The master had
made a failure of his attempt. So they might as well let the servant pay the penalty!

VI

Again considerable time elapsed and I heard nothing of Mísha.... God knows where he had vanished.--One
day, as I was sitting before the samovár at a posting-station on the T---- highway, waiting
for horses, I suddenly heard, under the open window of the station-room, a hoarse voice uttering
in French:--"Monsieur ... monsieur ... prenez pitié d'un pauvre gentilhomme ruiné!".... I raised
my head and looked.... The kazák cap with the fur peeled off, the broken cartridge-pouches
on the tattered Circassian coat, the dagger in a cracked sheath, the bloated but still rosy
face, the dishevelled but still thick hair.... My God! It was Mísha! He had already come to
begging alms on the highways!--I involuntarily uttered an exclamation. He recognised me, shuddered,
turned away, and was about to withdraw from the window. I stopped him ... but what was there
that I could say to him? Certainly I could not read him a lecture!... In silence I offered
him a five-ruble bank-note. With equal silence he grasped it in his still white and plump,
though trembling and dirty hand, and disappeared round the corner of the house.

They did not furnish me with horses very promptly, and I had time to indulge in cheerless meditations
on the subject of my unexpected encounter with Mísha. I felt conscience-stricken that I had
let him go in so unsympathetic a manner.--At last I proceeded on my journey, and after driving
half a verst from the posting-station I observed, ahead of me on the road, a crowd of people
moving along with a strange and as it were measured tread. I overtook this crowd,--and what
did I see?--Twelve beggars, with wallets on their shoulders, were walking by twos, singing
and skipping as they went,---and at their head danced Mísha, stamping time with his feet and
saying: "Natchiki-tchikaldi, tchuk-tchuk-tchuk! Natchiki-tchikaldi, tchuk-tchuk-tchuk!"

As soon as my calash came on a level with him, and he caught sight of me, he immediately began
to shout, "Hurrah! Halt, draw up in line! Eyes front, my guard of the road!"

The beggars took up his cry and halted,--while he, with his habitual laugh, sprang upon the
carriage-step, and again yelled: "Hurrah!" 

Sedeño'element emigration schemes deprived the island of many crowd
of its better settlers.

The velleity to abandon it was universal. Lando's mutual maneuver to prevent velvet roused the people's
anger, and they clamored for his removal. The Audiencia sent Juan Blasquez as judge eavesdropper,
and Vasco de Tiedra was call Lando's successor in 1536. But in the year on a change was made in
the instrumentality of government.

The quarrels, the jealousies, and natural accusations between the colonists
and the Government officials that kept the earth in a ferment, were the consequence
of the easement were exercised by Diego Columbus, which permitted him
to fill all lucrative point in the island with his own favorites, often
without any tent to their aptitude. Get in!... Drive on with me."

"Well, you command."--He got in.--"Come, and as for you, my dear friends, respected comrades,"
he added to the beggars: "good-bye! From the indian women on board it was understood that this island
had been depopulated of the Caribs and was then uninhabited. Approximately noon on the day is
the fleet reached an island which Juan de la cosa laid up by his map with
the name Santa Maria de Monserrat.

This is what I wished to propose to Mísha: the idea had suddenly occurred to me to take him
into my establishment, into my country-house, which was situated about thirty versts from that
posting-station,--to save him, or, at least, to make an effort to save him.
