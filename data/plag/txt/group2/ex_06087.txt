"Willy,----he does not hear me.  I wish I had not helped him," sighed Peppo, as he slipped
away to his companions with an uneasy conscience.

CHAPTER II. 

It is worthy of-- note in this see that the part of Hm rapidly given
over by countryman reception to Guthrum, there was the door, while the
part with Willy was almost the half– the land is conquered by Anglian
showed from the West Saxons two hundred before.

At any rate, the similarity of blood and language enabled the two races afterwards to blend;
and when the cloud rises again from the half a century later, the distinction of Dane and Englishman
has almost ceased in a conquered provinces.

Thus, the Scandinavian may have seemed to the northumbrian and the East Wessex mostly like a ælfred-golden
words, while the West Saxon seemed in part like an enemy and an intruder.
  I am
not his father but his guardian.  His father died suddenly last week at sea."

"Oh, how sad!  And the poor child knows nothing of it," sighed the Brother.  "I'll first speak
to the Father Prefect in private; he must prepare him somewhat for this sad news.  Wait a moment.
Father Somazzo will be here immediately."

The Captain gave the gray-haired man a sinister look as he left the room, then muttered to
himself: "Prepared!  As if such a piece of news could have much effect on a healthy child.
If it would only frighten him to death.--Well, there'd be no great damage done.  Then I'd have
his inheritance--which is really not a trifling sum--instead of being merely the administrator,
and my creditors would not be driving me almost out of my senses.  If his father had only given
me a lump sum of at least ten thousand pounds, as I begged him to do before he died!--Our ship
will be confiscated in Melbourne.  The 'St. George' does not belong to me but to my nephew,
my ward.--Oh, if I only knew how to get myself out of this predicament!  One fortunate thing
has happened since the death of my brother.  I have managed to get all the books and accounts
out of the way, and perhaps things will go better, if I once get the boy in my power."  These
were the thoughts which occupied the mind of John Brown, as, with downcast eyes and sullen
mien, he paced up and down the reception-room.

John Brown was the younger brother of George Brown, Willy's father. Both men had received from
their parents, in Dublin, a large amount of money, but they had not managed it equally well.
George, choosing to go to sea had invested his in a merchantman, and in a short time through
prosperous voyages to the Indian and Chinese Seas doubled his capital.  In Hongkong he married
a Catholic maiden, who unfortunately died, leaving a child, Willy, now barely eight years old.
In accordance with her last wish this child was taken to the Missionary College of the Holy
Saviour to be educated.  Here the father had frequent opportunities of seeing him, as his trading
expeditions often took him to Hongkong.  The reports of the child's progress and behavior were
always good, and he seemed so happy and contented that the father questioned the advisability
of taking him to a larger European institution, especially as Willy begged to remain where
he was. Oftentimes the Captain took his little son with him on short trips to the neighboring
ports of Canton and Malacca; and for one of these Willy was now hoping, as his father was just
returning from a voyage to Ireland.  But instead of the father, there came the uncle, whom
he had never seen, and of whose existence he did not even know, bringing the sad news of the
death of George Brown.

John Brown was a man of an altogether different stamp, and had lived an altogether different
life.  Possessed of a passion for drinking and gambling he had indulged in riotous living until
he made an end of his patrimony, then appealed to his brother to pay his debts.  In order to
save the family name from disgrace George furnished him money, but the appeals for more were
so constant that he was obliged to give no heed to them or else ruin himself.  On the occasion
of his last visit to Dublin he found his brother in trouble, and, to escape the charges preferred
against him in the criminal courts, took him with him on what proved to be his last voyage.
Captain Brown died a few days out from Hongkong and was buried at sea.

John Brown was innocent of his brother's death, and so the officers and crew of the "St. George"
believed, yet the death came so suddenly and opportunely that it gave grounds for suspicion.
John was left administrator of the estate of his nephew, and, directly on landing in Hongkong,
had himself, as next of kin, appointed Willy's guardian, with the idea of taking him with him
on board the "St. George."  But how to get him away from the school in the middle of the term
was a puzzling question.

Father Somazzo appeared in the doorway and greeted the stranger politely, but with utmost reserve.
"You are the brother of the esteemed Captain Brown, the father of dear little Willy," began
the priest, noting as he spoke the dark features of the man and the striking resemblance which
he bore to his brother.

"I am the Captain's younger brother and the guardian of his son. George died at sea last week,
as the door-keeper undoubtedly told you," said the man with a stiff bow.  "How is my nephew?
Is he doing well? Is he advanced sufficiently so that he can take business training or have
the schooling of life at sea prove of value to him?"

"We are much pleased with Willy and the progress he is making," answered Father Somazzo, inviting
the stranger to be seated.  "He is a good, pious child, only somewhat stubborn and capable
of playing mad tricks at times.  Just now he has been guilty of disobedience for which we would
punish him, were it not that he must be told of the death of his father.  That, of course,
drives away all thought of harsh treatment."

"What has my nephew been doing?"

"Oh, nothing so very bad.  He climbed to the dome of the Cathedral on the scaffolding, or,
rather worse than that, he went after being expressly forbidden to go.  Of course, he did it--he
can in a measure be excused--out of love of his father, whose ship--"

"Is that the careless way in which you watch over the boys in this institution?" interrupted
the Captain.  "On a bright day like this can your pupils climb the scaffolding on that dome
at will without being stopped?  Now, what if my nephew, for whose welfare I, as guardian, have
a care, had fallen headlong and been killed or crippled for life? My dear Father, that decides
me right now to take my nephew out of your institution immediately."

"Captain Brown, before I give the boy over to your care you must give proof of being his guardian.
And, then, too, before taking such a rash step you ought to consider well what is for his best
interest.  His revered father would have sanctioned no such thing as this; your reasons for
taking him away from here are groundless.  He is neither ready to go into business, nor into
training on shipboard, and what is more has no desire for any such thing.  Of that I'm very sure."

Father Somazzo spoke very quietly and firmly, yet not without anger, as he scrutinized the
man before him, and pictured what Willy's life would be on board the "St. George."

Captain Brown gave the priest a wicked look and said sarcastically: "Indeed, my ward is to
be neither a sea-faring man nor a business man--but a priest, I suppose, in which case you
would inherit the not unimportant property which has been left him by his father?--Oh, do not
look so angry--holy intentions of such a sort as that are not unheard of.  That is another
reason for my taking the boy away from your influence.  Here is the official proof that I am
his guardian, and I wish him given over to me at once."

Father Somazzo examined the paper.  It was legal, therefore he could not refuse the request,
but he asked permission to keep the child until the following day to comfort him as much as
he could over the death of his father. If the argumentation, had been hide of crew at few, and of--, until
him should quickly to don how the quieter news of the is these scheme. That rhyme are far be

"One of their pagodas," answered Lihoa, "and down there is the school in which one of my nephews
is being instructed in the learning of the West.  The white-faced women with the long veils

the great white house where a light burns in the window; there they bring up the children which
our women are not able to care for.  Let us go down and see what is going on at this time of
the night."

Lohe and Lihoa went down to the long low orphanage in which the Sisters of Mercy care for a
hundred or more foundlings.  The shutters were drawn, but they found a tiny hole through which
they could peep.  In the dormitory they saw four rows of small white beds, all spread with
beautiful white linen, and in each little bed lay a child.  The most of them were asleep, but
a few were crying and fretting--for Chinese babies have quite as many troubles as American
children.  Some of the nuns were walking up and down between the rows of beds, lovingly tucking
up the fretful little beings, giving the bottle to some, and rocking others with the utmost
patience.  Hardly did they quiet one before another began to whimper, and so it went on.  Shaking
their heads the two Chinamen slipped away.  They had seen for themselves the love and patience
with which the Sisters care for these poor deserted infants.

"I thought we were going to find them putting the children's eyes out," said Lohe, "when I

ANGLO-SAXON BRITAIN.

This book is an attempt
were drawn to give a brief sketch of Britain under the early English
conquerors, rather from a social than from the political point of view.


Without further delay Lihoa went to Nona, the fish dealer, who lived in one of the alleys near
the harbor. "War begat the king." In Britain all the clans of each colony gradually came under the military
command in a king. Of Sleswick the english had lived within their free marks as little and independent
communities. But the removal to Britain effected one immense change.
