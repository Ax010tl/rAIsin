This hotel was a large and somewhat rough establishment, intended for the accommodation of
invalids who came to Vernet for their health. It was built immediately over one of the thermal
springs, so that the water flowed from the bowels of the earth directly into the baths. There
was accommodation for seventy people, and during the summer and autumn months the place was
always full.  Not a few also were to be found there during the winter and spring, for the charges
of Madame Bauche were low, and the accommodation reasonably good.

And in this respect, as indeed in all others, Madame Bauche had the reputation of being an
honest woman.  She had a certain price, from which no earthly consideration would induce her
to depart; and there were certain returns for this price in the shape of dejeuners and dinners,
baths and beds, which she never failed to give in accordance with the dictates of a strict
conscience.  These were traits in the character of an hotel-keeper which cannot be praised
too highly, and which had met their due reward in the custom of the public.  But nevertheless
there were those who thought that there was occasionally ground for complaint in the conduct
even of Madame Bauche.

In the first place she was deficient in that pleasant smiling softness which should belong
to any keeper of a house of public entertainment.  In her general mode of life she was stern
and silent with her guests, autocratic, authoritative and sometimes contradictory in her house,
and altogether irrational and unconciliatory when any change even for a day was proposed to
her, or when any shadow of a complaint reached her ears.

Indeed of complaint, as made against the establishment, she was altogether intolerant.  To
such she had but one answer.  He or she who complained might leave the place at a moment's
notice if it so pleased them.  There were always others ready to take their places. The power
of making this answer came to her from the lowness of her prices; and it was a power which
was very dear to her.

The baths were taken at different hours according to medical advice, but the usual time was
from five to seven in the morning.  The dejeuner or early meal was at nine o'clock, the dinner
was at four. After that, no eating or drinking was allowed in the Hotel Bauche. There was a
cafe in the village, at which ladies and gentlemen could get a cup of coffee or a glass of
eau sucre; but no such accommodation was to be had in the establishment.  Not by any possible
bribery or persuasion could any meal be procured at any other than the authorised hours.  A
visitor who should enter the salle a manger more than ten minutes after the last bell would
be looked at very sourly by Madame Bauche, who on all occasions sat at the top of her own table. But forgive my vanity. Was not you at this time the only Cordoba
who made love prophetess. Another came before you, who competed in this with you. Not worth much,
because the man whose future worth loving discovered her in his prophetic vision worth a thousand
times less than the strain of his intelligence and his revealing strong will have doubled or tripled
the greatness of the known world, and has magnified the concept of creation in every human mind.
Compared to the glory of man, which is worth little is achieved by defeating armies, conquering
kingdoms and subjugating and humiliating the chief more powerful. It is nevertheless more than
you this woman that I speak, because you have revealed no Columbus himself what he already knew his
own worth. You will lend credit, encouragement and hope and trust in men and in his fortune, but
this woman that I speak, in his high love for me, because it was my girlfriend, did not merely
give me credit, encouragement and hope, but it became clear to my soul the greatness of her dream
that my soul had, gave me faith placed in me, my ambition became debt of gratitude to her,
and made me be great for that she was not, nor accused of being lightweight and not taken
for a liar.

The Grand Master did not know then shut up. Beatriz told the loves of his boyhood runaways first.
And even some say that you cited, hovering tears in their eyes, some
of the letter I had written Dona Mencia, and he mercifully kept in
memory.

Gonzalo said finally:

- I confess, to not disclose that after other women have loved and been loved for them. None,
however, has broken down and thrown into the sanctuary of my soul
the venerated image, placed there on everything earthly and perishable,
the woman who showed me myself I be himself, that perhaps the creative
virtue of his love planted in my mind the seed of everything good
and noble all I could do in my life.

Recounting the story he told me D. John Fresco, whose certainty confirmed to some point, my
dear friend D. Aureliano, I can not remember a study that he wrote and published years ago,
Rosa Cleveland, sister of former President of the United States. The study entitled Faith altruistic,
capital seeks to demonstrate that the mission of women is to reveal
to man his top destinations, encourage him to fight and inspire the
spirit and confidence that are necessary to achieve them.

MASTER RAYMOND

I

In several treatises on political economy I have seen an account,
from which it follows that the industry of cobblers in France has
produced since the discovery of America until today, six or seven
times more wealth than all the gold and silver have come to Europe
from this new and vast continent. This leads me, without fear of going
through unlikely inventor of backstage, teacher talking here of Raymond.
  He
had been sent to Paris to see something of the world, and learn to talk French instead of the
patois of his valley; and having left Paris had come down south into Languedoc, and remained
there picking up some agricultural lore which it was thought might prove useful in the valley
farms of Vernet.  He was now expected home again very speedily, much to his mother's delight.

That she was kind and gracious to her favourite child does not perhaps give much proof of her
benevolence; but she had also been kind and gracious to the orphan child of a neighbour; nay,
to the orphan child of a rival innkeeper.  At Vernet there had been more than one water establishment,
but the proprietor of the second had died some few years after Madame Bauche had settled herself
at the place.  His house had not thrived, and his only child, a little girl, was left altogether
without provision.

This little girl, Marie Clavert, La Mere Bauche had taken into her own house immediately after
the father's death, although she had most cordially hated that father.  Marie was then an infant,
and Madame Bauche had accepted the charge without much thought, perhaps, as to what might be
the child's ultimate destiny.  But since then she had thoroughly done the duty of a mother
by the little girl, who had become the pet of the whole establishment, the favourite plaything
of Adolphe Bauche, and at last of course his early sweetheart.

And then and therefore there had come troubles at Vernet.  Of course all the world of the valley
had seen what was taking place and what was likely to take place, long before Madame Bauche
knew anything about it.  But at last it broke upon her senses that her son, Adolphe Bauche,
the heir to all her virtues and all her riches, the first young man in that or any neighbouring
valley, was absolutely contemplating the idea of marrying that poor little orphan, Marie Clavert!

That any one should ever fall in love with Marie Clavert had never occurred to Madame Bauche.
She had always regarded the child as a child, as the object of her charity, and as a little
thing to be looked on as poor Marie by all the world.  She, looking through her green spectacles,
had never seen that Marie Clavert was a beautiful creature, full of ripening charms, such as
young men love to look on. Marie was of infinite daily use to Madame Bauche in a hundred little
things about the house, and the old lady thoroughly recognised and appreciated her ability.
But for this very reason she had never taught herself to regard Marie otherwise than as a useful
drudge. She was very fond of her protegee--so much so that she would listen to her in affairs
about the house when she would listen to no one else;--but Marie's prettiness and grace and
sweetness as a girl had all been thrown away upon Maman Bauche, as Marie used to call her.

But unluckily it had not been thrown away upon Adolphe.  He had appreciated, as it was natural
that he should do, all that had been so utterly indifferent to his mother; and consequently
had fallen in love.  Consequently also he had told his love; and consequently also Marie had
returned his love.

Adolphe had been hitherto contradicted but in few things, and thought that all difficulty would
be prevented by his informing his mother that he wished to marry Marie Clavert.  But Marie,
with a woman's instinct, had known better.  She had trembled and almost crouched with fear
when she confessed her love; and had absolutely hid herself from sight when Adolphe went forth,
prepared to ask his mother's consent to his marriage.

The indignation and passionate wrath of Madame Bauche were past and gone two years before the
date of this story, and I need not therefore much enlarge upon that subject.  She was at first
abusive and bitter, which was bad for Marie; and afterwards bitter and silent, which was worse.
It was of course determined that poor Marie should be sent away to some asylum for orphans
or penniless paupers-- in short anywhere out of the way.  What mattered her outlook into the
world, her happiness, or indeed her very existence?  The outlook and happiness of Adolphe Bauche,--was
not that to be considered as everything at Vernet? 

Lazarus felt that this and mortifications were not martyrs, but also said that it was not living
in the world and their struggles, and that being good few people around him could not be detestable
life. How different was offered the show the world that began a step beyond those walls respected!
True that everything was behind closed doors rest and holiness, but how many horrors and sorrows
awaited him to put the plant in that society where every day is a struggle and every hour a
wound! It was the poor guy plans for the future, and judging life as he had painted it, thinking
it was all evils, sorrows and misfortunes, was preparing to enter her anxious, fearful, like inexperienced
soldier soon to hear the first step attack touched by the horns of
his battalion.

TratÃ¡bale his uncle graciously, respect or adulation of the prelate, did the same thing those
around him, and thanks to their protection Lazarus entered the race to which he had designed, shielded
from the hardships, fraught with the future fortunes, and soul full of foreboding. He had painted his mission
so that, impressed the imagination, saw in the priesthood generous apostolate of the whole idea.
But despite this, when alone with his prayer book under his arm, he looked across the wide corridors
or sit under the shade of the garden, it seemed that in his soul seethed and poked their eyes vague
fears for his future life and doubts about the fate that was reserved. The holy house that
was lived, in his view, a port of refuge from the infernal wave of human malice. For all that his
books devoted advised him to flee, came to the knowledge of how certain words should be the warning
him that worldly dangers, and by the endless and tiring excitation to virtue, could appreciate
how deep and frequent the depths sin. As I was considering the temptations that might surround
him, the risks would have to anticipate and avoid evil, intelligence, watching with delight the
prospect of days of horrible but holy and glorious struggle, preparation for immortality.
  It was never in his way as wooden legs usually are in the way
of their wearers.  And then to render it more illustrious it had round its middle, round the
calf of the leg we may so say, a band of bright brass which shone like burnished gold.

It had been the capitaine's custom, now for some years past, to retire every evening at about
seven o'clock into the sanctum sanctorum of Madame Bauche's habitation, the dark little private
sitting-room in which she made out her bills and calculated her profits, and there regale himself
in her presence--and indeed at her expense, for the items never appeared in the bill--with
coffee and cognac.  I have said that there was never eating or drinking at the establishment
after the regular dinner-hours; but in so saying I spoke of the world at large.  Nothing further
was allowed in the way of trade; but in the way of friendship so much was now-a-days always
allowed to the capitaine.

It was at these moments that Madame Bauche discussed her private affairs, and asked for and
received advice.  For even Madame Bauche was mortal; nor could her green spectacles without
other aid carry her through all the troubles of life.  It was now five years since the world
of Vernet discovered that La Mere Bauche was going to marry the capitaine; and for eighteen
months the world of Vernet had been full of this matter:  but any amount of patience is at
last exhausted, and as no further steps in that direction were ever taken beyond the daily
cup of coffee, that subject died away--very much unheeded by La Mere Bauche.

But she, though she thought of no matrimony for herself, thought much of matrimony for other
people; and over most of those cups of evening coffee and cognac a matrimonial project was
discussed in these latter days.  It has been seen that the capitaine pleaded in Marie's favour
when the fury of Madame Bauche's indignation broke forth; and that ultimately Marie was kept
at home, and Adolphe sent away by his advice. The father read very carefully the first four or five pages, but do not understand
a word, he became dizzy and stopped reading. And it was very escamÃ³n, got to wonder then,
whether failure to understand what it would be because of their ignorance, or whether it
would, in the words of CÃ¡novas, who had come to this place, because her son was a fool adulterated
by study or whether it was because there had been no such study no such alteration, but because
the boy had studied very little and to conceal it, his speech was full of empty phrases,
confident in its boldness and simplicity of many people who do not
understand is what they most admire.

Anyway, the teacher corrected and Raymond, moderated by the old, in his heart greening parental love
on the remains of other dead, and less holy love, and perhaps projecting that the boy, who
had served twenty-five, won popularity and sympathy in the district, to be elected, he sent for
mandatory sick with terms and until ceasing to send money, which was the most effective way that I
could rely.

D. Raymond, therefore, could not but obey.

Pleased his father, came to Villalegre Villalegre and found himself
in very comfortable.

So you can see the sincerity of his joy and pleasure and satisfaction
that the place was, we will put here a circumstantial letter, a month
of being in Villalegre, Don Raymond wrote his best friend in Madrid.
The letter read as follows.  As to that matter of dowry she was prepared to be more than
generous.  She did love Marie well, and could find it in her heart to give her anything--any
thing except her son, her own Adolphe.  What she proposed was this.  Adolphe, himself, would
never keep the baths.  If the capitaine would take Marie for his wife, Marie, Madame Bauche
declared, should be the mistress after her death; subject of course to certain settlements
as to Adolphe's pecuniary interests.

The plan was discussed a thousand times, and at last so far brought to bear that Marie was
made acquainted with it--having been called in to sit in presence with La Mere Bauche and her
future proposed husband.  The poor girl manifested no disgust to the stiff ungainly lover whom
they assigned to her,--who through his whole frame was in appearance almost as wooden as his
own leg.  On the whole, indeed, Marie liked the capitaine, and felt that he was her friend;
and in her country such marriages were not uncommon.  The capitaine was perhaps a little beyond
the age at which a man might usually be thought justified in demanding the services of a young
girl as his nurse and wife, but then Marie of herself had so little to give-- except her youth,
and beauty, and goodness.

But yet she could not absolutely consent; for was she not absolutely pledged to her own Adolphe?
And therefore, when the great pecuniary advantages were, one by one, displayed before her,
and when La Mere Bauche, as a last argument, informed her that as wife of the capitaine she
would be regarded as second mistress in the establishment and not as a servant, she could only
burst out into tears, and say that she did not know.

"I will be very kind to you," said the capitaine; "as kind as a man can be."

Marie took his hard withered hand and kissed it; and then looked up into his face with beseeching
eyes which were not without avail upon his heart.

"We will not press her now," said the capitaine.  "There is time enough."

But let his heart be touched ever so much, one thing was certain.  It could not be permitted
that she should marry Adolphe. 

Making shoes began to be rich, then his wealth grew, giving money to award, although to be conscientious
man, fearing God and very compassionate, never took more than 10 100 a year later, he founded
and opened a shop or bazaar, where they sold all there is to sell sugar, coffee, beans, cod, cards,
prayer books, books for school children, and all kind of fabrics and trimmings for the clothing
of men and women. The teacher was being also quite a few estates of their debtors, and became owner
of vineyards, olive groves, orchards and farms.

No longer wielded the awl, or put the tirapié, or soiled fingers cerote but true to its origins,
retaining the shoe store where they worked official experts, the disciples own. The Grand
Bazaar was next. And next to the shoe and the bazaar could be seen revoked and the beautiful façade
of the house, situated in the central and widest street in town. Behind this house and in uninterrupted
succession, had patios, yards, stables, tinados, warehouses, barns, press, oil mill, and in
short, everything that can hold and has a wealthy farmer and owner of Andalusia. The back
door that gave entrance these barns, one could say that was outside the walls of the village,
if people have walls, while the main door, as stated above was at the center.

The teacher Raymond never wanted to commit or be mixed in politics, but suddenly had to change. He
had done fusion and had agreed to be head of that party Villalegre politician and mayor.

He was a widower, was already fifteen years. And it was about seven he had his only son, D. Raimundo
Roldán Chain, studying or walking and idling in Madrid, then on this point differ not a little
the authors. Also differ about the cause of the long and uninterrupted absence the child, attributing
one happier than widowhood Recollect father, for which there embarrassment or scandal was the presence
of the child, and others attributing it to indifference and arrogance the latter, who lived in Madrid
as elegant and illustrious gentleman, who spoke of his house manor, and repelled back to the
place to see the plebeian coarseness of his father and the early fundamental and shoe tenaciously
preserved.  Without that she would be nothing; with
that,--with that assured, she could wait patiently till doomsday.

Letters were written to Adolphe during all these eventful doings; and a letter came from him
saying that he greatly valued Marie's love, but that as it had been clearly proved to him that
their marriage would be neither for her advantage, nor for his, he was willing to give it up.
He consented to her marriage with the capitaine, and expressed his gratitude to his mother
for the pecuniary advantages which she had held out to him.  Oh, Adolphe, Adolphe!  But, alas,
alas! is not such the way of most men's hearts--and of the hearts of some women?

This letter was read to Marie, but it had no more effect upon her than would have had some
dry legal document.  In those days and in those places men and women did not depend much upon
letters; nor when they were written, was there expressed in them much of heart or of feeling.
Marie would understand, as she was well aware, the glance of Adolphe's eye and the tone of
Adolphe's voice; she would perceive at once from them what her lover really meant, what he
wished, what in the innermost corner of his heart he really desired that she should do.  But
from that stiff constrained written document she could understand nothing.

It was agreed therefore that Adolphe should return, and that she would accept her fate from
his mouth.  The capitaine, who knew more of human nature than poor Marie, felt tolerably sure
of his bride. Adolphe, who had seen something of the world, would not care very much for the
girl of his own valley.  Money and pleasure, and some little position in the world, would soon
wean him from his love; and then Marie would accept her destiny--as other girls in the same
position had done since the French world began.

And now it was the evening before Adolphe's expected arrival.  La Mere Bauche was discussing
the matter with the capitaine over the usual cup of coffee.  Madame Bauche had of late become
rather nervous on the matter, thinking that they had been somewhat rash in acceding so much
to Marie.  It seemed to her that it was absolutely now left to the two young lovers to say
whether or no they would have each other or not.  Now nothing on earth could be further from
Madame Bauche's intention than this.  Her decree and resolve was to heap down blessings on
all persons concerned--provided always that she could have her own way; but, provided she did
not have her own way, to heap down,--anything but blessings.  She had her code of morality
in this matter.  She would do good if possible to everybody around her.  But she would not
on any score be induced to consent that Adolphe should marry Marie Clavert.  Should that be
in the wind she would rid the house of Marie, of the capitaine, and even of Adolphe himself.

She had become therefore somewhat querulous, and self-opinionated in her discussions with her
friend.

"I don't know," she said on the evening in question; "I don't know. It may be all right; but
if Adolphe turns against me, what are we to do then?"

"Mere Bauche," said the capitaine, sipping his coffee and puffing out the smoke of his cigar,
"Adolphe will not turn against us."  It had been somewhat remarked by many that the capitaine
was more at home in the house, and somewhat freer in his manner of talking with Madame Bauche,
since this matrimonial alliance had been on the tapis than he had ever been before. The Duke seemed preoccupied with those old ideas, manifested by frequent
references to his "Conscience" and the "Party."

Tradition-bound as he was, his Duchess was far more rigid. Aristocratic
to the core, only in love or in fashion would she demonstrate the least
concession to progress.

Her daring innovations could be seen at Easter Mass, where she pointedly demonstrated her concern
for the poor and devoutly said novenas to benefit those she favored. At those
times, she seemed lit from within, a sparkling glow dispersed by way
of her lively eyes.


"Ah!" exclaimed Madame Bauche, "poor lad!  He has not a sous in the world unless I give it
to him."  But it did not seem that this reflection was in itself displeasing to her.

"Adolphe will now be a man of the world," continued the capitaine. "He will know that it does
not do to throw away everything for a pair of red lips.  That is the folly of a boy, and Adolphe
will be no longer a boy.  Believe me, Mere Bauche, things will be right enough."

"And then we shall have Marie sick and ill and half dying on our hands," said Madame Bauche.

This was not flattering to the capitaine, and so he felt it. "Perhaps so, perhaps not," he
said.  "But at any rate she will get over it.  It is a malady which rarely kills young women--especially
when another alliance awaits them."

"Bah!" said Madame Bauche; and in saying that word she avenged herself for the too great liberty
which the capitaine had lately taken.  He shrugged his shoulders, took a pinch of snuff and
uninvited helped himself to a teaspoonful of cognac.  Then the conference ended, and on the
next morning before breakfast Adolphe Bauche arrived.

On that morning poor Marie hardly knew how to bear herself.  A month or two back, and even
up to the last day or two, she had felt a sort of confidence that Adolphe would be true to
her; but the nearer came that fatal day the less strong was the confidence of the poor girl.
She knew that those two long-headed, aged counsellors were plotting against her happiness,
and she felt that she could hardly dare hope for success with such terrible foes opposed to
her.  On the evening before the day Madame Bauche had met her in the passages, and kissed her
as she wished her good night.  Marie knew little about sacrifices, but she felt that it was
a sacrificial kiss.

In those days a sort of diligence with the mails for Olette passed through Prades early in
the morning, and a conveyance was sent from Vernet to bring Adolphe to the baths.  Never was
prince or princess expected with more anxiety.  Madame Bauche was up and dressed long before
the hour, and was heard to say five several times that she was sure he would not come.  The
capitaine was out and on the high road, moving about with his wooden leg, as perpendicular
as a lamp-post and almost as black.  Marie also was up, but nobody had seen her.  She was up
and had been out about the place before any of them were stirring; but now that the world was
on the move she lay hidden like a hare in its form.

And then the old char-a-banc clattered up to the door, and Adolphe jumped out of it into his
mother's arms.  He was fatter and fairer than she had last seen him, had a larger beard, was
more fashionably clothed, and certainly looked more like a man.  Marie also saw him out of
her little window, and she thought that he looked like a god. Was it probable, she said to
herself, that one so godlike would still care for her?

The mother was delighted with her son, who rattled away quite at his ease.  He shook hands
very cordially with the capitaine--of whose intended alliance with his own sweetheart he had
been informed, and then as he entered the house with his hand under his mother's arm, he asked
one question about her.  "And where is Marie?" said he. "Marie! oh upstairs; you shall see
her after breakfast," said La Mere Bauche.  And so they entered the house, and went in to breakfast
among the guests.  Everybody had heard something of the story, and they were all on the alert
to see the young man whose love or want of love was considered to be of so much importance. The scrolls from curling, cracking and snapping,
and the ashes, absorbed the outbreak of the fire, wrapped in a cloud flying smoke until it disappeared
down the barrel of the fireplace.

Lazarus would have given much trocar in his memory tangible thing,
to destroy it too!

When the man abjure their errors, should have the right to forget.

At home, on moments earlier, was not there a little more than a pile
of ashes, and wrapped between her warm embers shine snaps were a book
of hours, and metallic wires crimp in a rosary.

The sacrifice was consummated. Awareness of Lazarus always resisted giving the name of apostasy.

Then they came to comfort those fictions deceptive one of great bitterness forging of life, false
hopes that have sprouted in the heat of enthusiasm or desire, but that come with step slow and
awkward, disobedient to the will that evokes, then memories took the form of hope, not coldly conceived
by the brain, but arises from the bottom of her heart, Lazarus felt
lips get an idea that resulted in a loving word pronounced.

His whole future was condensed into it.

"The village!"

The next morning the mud of the garden still bore traces of printed Lazarus indicating the place
where he had climbed the fence to flee like a thief in the house, where it was taken almost
a saint.

XV.

He left the court in a mixed train, crawling awkwardly as huge reptile sentenced to always go
the same way, greeting them with loud whistles places stopping at the same places, until after twenty
hours of travel arrived in the station closest to his people, to whom he had to go through an extensive
plain to limit the extent of which put several hills that were visible a long distance, shrouded
floating mist.

Stood near the station honors a sale inn, and next to the door, sitting
around two tables covered with filthy and unsafe Jarrilla of wine,
drank and shouted half a dozen herdsmen and shepherds. Lazarus crossed
before them without stopping, asked hostel adjusted a mule to go to
his village the next day, and shutting in a narrow room prepared to
spend the night.

It was late afternoon.ted a mule to go to
his village the next day, and shutting in a narrow room prepared to
spend the night.

It was late afternoon.  The countenance of Madame Bauche was serene
and comfortable; her hopes of ultimate success ran higher than ever.  The face of the capitaine
was masked, as are always the faces of great diplomatists; he walked placid and upright, raising
his wooden leg with an ease and skill that was absolutely marvellous.  But poor Adolphe's brow
was clouded.  Yes, poor Adolphe! for he was poor in spirit, he had pledged himself to give
up Marie, and to accept the liberal allowance which his mother tendered him; but it remained
for him now to communicate these tidings to Marie herself.
