THE

AMERICANISM

OF

WASHINGTON

By

Henry van Dyke

1906

Hard is the task of the man who at this late day attempts to say anything new about Washington.
But perhaps it may be possible to unsay some of the things which have been said, and which,
though they were at one time new, have never at any time been strictly true.

The character of Washington, emerging splendid from the dust and tumult of those great conflicts
in which he played the leading part, has passed successively into three media of obscuration,
from each of which his figure, like the sun shining through vapors, has received some disguise
of shape and color. First came the mist of mythology, in which we discerned the new St. George,
serene, impeccable, moving through an orchard of ever-blooming cherry-trees, gracefully vanquishing
dragons with a touch, and shedding fragrance and radiance around him. Out of that mythological
mist we groped our way, to find ourselves beneath the rolling clouds of oratory, above which
the head of the hero was pinnacled in remote grandeur, like a sphinx poised upon a volcanic
peak, isolated and mysterious. That altitudinous figure still dominates the cloudy landscapes
of the after-dinner orator; but the frigid, academic mind has turned away from it, and looking
through the fog of criticism has descried another Washington, not really an American, not amazingly
a hero, but a very decent English country gentleman, honorable, courageous, good, shrewd, slow,
and above all immensely lucky.

 "The ever favorite object of my heart"--how quietly, how simply he discloses the source
and origin of a sublime consecration, a lifelong heroism! Thus speaks the victor in calm retrospect
of the long battle. But if you would know the depth and the intensity of the divine fire that
burned within his breast you must go back to the dark and icy days of Valley Forge, and hear
him cry in passion unrestrained: "If I know my own mind, I could offer myself a living sacrifice
to the butchering enemy, provided that would contribute to the people's ease. I would be a
living offering to the savage fury and die by inches to save the people."

"The ever favorite object of my heart!" I strike this note again and again, insisting upon
it, harping upon it; for it is the key-note of the music. It is the capacity to find such an
object in the success of the people's cause, to follow it unselfishly, to serve it loyally,
that distinguishes the men who stood with Washington and who deserve to share his fame. I read
the annals of the Revolution, and I find everywhere this secret and searching test dividing
the strong from the weak, the noble from the base, the heirs of glory from the captives of
oblivion and the inheritors of shame. It was the unwillingness to sink and forget self in the
service of something greater that made the failures and wrecks of those tempestuous times,
through which the single-hearted and the devoted pressed on to victory and honor.

Turn back to the battle of Saratoga. There were two Americans on that field who suffered under
a great personal disappointment: Philip Schuyler, who was unjustly supplanted in command of
the army by General Gates; and Benedict Arnold, who was deprived by envy of his due share in
the glory of winning the battle. Schuyler forgot his own injury in loyalty to the cause, offered
to serve Gates in any capacity, and went straight on to the end of his noble life giving all
that he had to his country. But in Arnold's heart the favorite object was not his country,
but his own ambition, and the wound which his pride received at Saratoga rankled and festered
and spread its poison through his whole nature, until he went forth from the camp, "a leper
white as snow."

What was it that made Charles Lee, as fearless a man as ever lived, play the part of a coward
in order to hide his treason at the battle of Monmouth? It was the inward eating corruption
of that selfish vanity which caused him to desire the defeat of an army whose command he had
wished but failed to attain. He had offered his sword to America for his own glory, and when
that was denied him, he withdrew the offering, and died, as he had lived, to himself.

What was it that tarnished the fame of Gates and Wilkinson and Burr and Conway? What made their
lives, and those of men like them, futile and inefficient compared with other men whose natural
gifts were less? It was the taint of dominant selfishness that ran through their careers, now
hiding itself, now breaking out in some act of malignity or treachery. Of the common interest
they were reckless, provided they might advance their own. Disappointed in that "ever favorite
object of their hearts," they did not hesitate to imperil the cause in whose service they were
enlisted.

Turn to other cases, in which a charitable judgment will impute no positive betrayal of trusts,
but a defect of vision to recognize the claim of the higher ideal. Tory or Revolutionist a
man might be, according to his temperament and conviction; but where a man begins with protests
against tyranny and ends with subservience to it, we look for the cause. What was it that separated
Joseph Galloway from Francis Hopkinson? It was Galloway's opinion that, while the struggle
for independence might be justifiable, it could not be successful, and the temptation of a
larger immediate reward under the British crown than could ever be given by the American Congress
in which he had once served. Enemy. England does not interpret a leave at all.

 His patient, skilful, laborious efforts in France did as much for the final

Men tell us that the age of ideals is past, and that we are now come to the age of expediency,
of polite indifference to moral standards, of careful attention to the bearing of different
policies upon our own personal interests. Men tell us that the rights of man are a poetic fiction,
that democracy has nothing in it to command our allegiance unless it promotes our individual
comfort and prosperity, and that the whole duty of a citizen is to vote with his party and
get an office for himself, or for some one who will look after him. Men tell us that to succeed
means to get money, because with that all other good things can be secured. Men tell us that
the one thing to do is to promote and protect the particular trade, or industry, or corporation

There is a battle that is worth fighting now, as it was worth fighting then, and that is the
battle for justice and equality. To make our city and our State free in fact as well as in
name; to break the rings that strangle real liberty, and to keep them broken; to cleanse, so
far as in our power lies, the fountains of our national life from political, commercial, and
social corruption; to teach our sons and daughters, by precept and example, the honor of serving
such a country as America--that is work worthy of the finest manhood and womanhood. "wholly, it is
