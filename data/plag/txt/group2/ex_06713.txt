"When overwhelmed by sorrow, I have met unkindness; I looked for some one to have pity on me;
but found none!--The healing balm of sympathy is denied; I weep, a solitary wretch, and the
hot tears scald my cheeks. I have not the medicine of life, the dear chimera I have so often
chased, a friend. Shade of my loved Ann! dost thou ever visit thy poor Mary? Refined spirit,
thou wouldst weep, could angels weep, to see her struggling with passions she cannot subdue;
and feelings which corrode her small portion of comfort!"

She could not write any more; she wished herself far distant from all human society; a thick
gloom spread itself over her mind: but did not make her forget the very beings she wished to
fly from. She sent for the poor woman she found in the garret; gave her money to clothe herself
and children, and buy some furniture for a little hut, in a large garden, the master of which
agreed to employ her husband, who had been bred a gardener. Mary promised to visit the family,
and see their new abode when she was able to go out.

CHAP. XXIV.

Mary still continued weak and low, though it was spring, and all nature began to look gay;
with more than usual brightness the sun shone, and a little robin which she had cherished during
the winter sung one of his best songs. The family were particularly civil this fine morning,
and tried to prevail on her to walk out. Any thing like kindness melted her; she consented.

Softer emotions banished her melancholy, and she directed her steps to the habitation she had
rendered comfortable.

Emerging out of a dreary chamber, all nature looked cheerful; when she had last walked out,
snow covered the ground, and bleak winds pierced her through and through: now the hedges were
green, the blossoms adorned the trees, and the birds sung. She reached the dwelling, without
being much exhausted and while she rested there, observed the children sporting on the grass,
with improved complexions. The mother with tears thanked her deliverer, and pointed out her
comforts. Mary's tears flowed not only from sympathy, but a complication of feelings and recollections
the affections which bound her to her fellow creatures began again to play, and reanimated
nature. She observed the change in herself, tried to account for it, and wrote with her pencil
a rhapsody on sensibility.

"Sensibility is the most exquisite feeling of which the human soul is susceptible: when it
pervades us, we feel happy; and could it last unmixed, we might form some conjecture of the
bliss of those paradisiacal days, when the obedient passions were under the dominion of reason,
and the impulses of the heart did not need correction.

"It is this quickness, this delicacy of feeling, which enables us to relish the sublime touches
of the poet, and the painter; it is this, which expands the soul, gives an enthusiastic greatness,
mixed with tenderness, when we view the magnificent objects of nature; or hear of a good action.
The same effect we experience in the spring, when we hail the returning sun, and the consequent
renovation of nature; when the flowers unfold themselves, and exhale their sweets, and the
voice of music is heard in the land. Softened by tenderness; the soul is disposed to be virtuous.
Is any sensual gratification to be compared to that of feelings the eves moistened after having
comforted the unfortunate?

"Sensibility is indeed the foundation of all our happiness; but these raptures are unknown
to the depraved sensualist, who is only moved by what strikes his gross senses; the delicate
embellishments of nature escape his notice; as do the gentle and interesting affections.--But
it is only to be felt; it escapes discussion."

She then returned home, and partook of the family meal, which was rendered more cheerful by
the presence of a man, past the meridian of life, of polished manners, and dazzling wit. He
endeavoured to draw Mary out, and succeeded; she entered into conversation, and some of her
artless flights of genius struck him with surprise; he found she had a capacious mind, and
that her reason was as profound as her imagination was lively. She glanced from earth to heaven,
and caught the light of truth. Her expressive countenance shewed what passed in her mind, and
her tongue was ever the faithful interpreter of her heart; duplicity never threw a shade over
her words or actions. Mary found him a man of learning; and the exercise of her understanding
would frequently make her forget her griefs, when nothing else could, except benevolence.

This man had known the mistress of the house in her youth; good nature induced him to visit
her; but when he saw Mary he had another inducement. Her appearance, and above all, her genius,
and cultivation of mind, roused his curiosity; but her dignified manners had such an effect
on him, he was obliged to suppress it. He knew men, as well as books; his conversation was
entertaining and improving. In Mary's company he doubted whether heaven was peopled with spirits
masculine; and almost forgot that he had called the sex "the pretty play things that render
life tolerable."

He had been the slave of beauty, the captive of sense; love he ne'er had felt; the mind never
rivetted the chain, nor had the purity of it made the body appear lovely in his eyes. He was
humane, despised meanness; but was vain of his abilities, and by no means a useful member of
society. He talked often of the beauty of virtue; but not having any solid foundation to build
the practice on, he was only a shining, or rather a sparkling character: and though his fortune
enabled him to hunt down pleasure, he was discontented.

Mary observed his character, and wrote down a train of reflections, which these observations
led her to make; these reflections received a tinge from her mind; the present state of it,
was that kind of painful quietness which arises from reason clouded by disgust; she had not
yet learned to be resigned; vague hopes agitated her.

"There are some subjects that are so enveloped in clouds, as you dissipate one, another overspreads
it. Of this kind are our reasonings concerning happiness; till we are obliged to cry out with
the Apostle, That it hath not entered into the heart of man to conceive in what it could consist,
or how satiety could be prevented. Man seems formed for action, though the passions are seldom
properly managed; they are either so languid as not to serve as a spur, or else so violent,
as to overleap all bounds.

"Every individual has its own peculiar trials; and anguish, in one shape or other, visits every
heart. Sensibility produces flights of virtue; and not curbed by reason, is on the brink of
vice talking, and even thinking of virtue.

"Christianity can only afford just principles to govern the wayward feelings and impulses of
the heart: every good disposition runs wild, if not transplanted into this soil; but how hard
is it to keep the heart diligently, though convinced that the issues of life depend on it.

Canterbury assigned the hand.

If I am to lose the support of my age, and be again a widow--may I call her Child whom my Henry
wishes me to adopt?"

This new instance of Henry's disinterested affection, Mary felt most forcibly; and striving
to restrain the complicated emotions, and sooth the wretched mother, she almost fainted: when
the unhappy parent forced tears from her, by saying, "I deserve this blow; my partial fondness
made me neglect him, when most he wanted a mother's care; this neglect, perhaps, first injured
his constitution: righteous Heaven has made my crime its own punishment; and now I am indeed
a mother, I shall loss my child--my only child!"

When they were a little more composed they hastened to the invalide; but during the short ride,
the mother related several instances of Henry's goodness of heart. Mary's tears were not those
of unmixed anguish; the display of his virtues gave her extreme delight--yet human nature prevailed;
she trembled to think they would soon unfold themselves in a more genial clime.

CHAP. XXIX.

She found Henry very ill. The physician had some weeks before declared he never knew a person
with a similar pulse recover. Henry was certain he could not live long; all the rest he could
obtain, was procured by opiates. Mary now enjoyed the melancholy pleasure of nursing him, and
softened by her tenderness the pains she could not remove. Every sigh did she stifle, every
tear restrain, when he could see or hear them. She would boast of her resignation--yet catch
eagerly at the least ray of hope. While he slept she would support his pillow, and rest her
head where she could feel his breath. She loved him better than herself--she could not pray
for his recovery; she could only say, The will of Heaven be done.

While she was in this state, she labored to acquire fortitude; but one tender look destroyed
it all--she rather labored, indeed, to make him believe he was resigned, than really to be so.

She wished to receive the sacrament with him, as a bond of union which was to extend beyond
the grave. She did so, and received comfort from it; she rose above her misery. 

Again was a burial. She take over stupor.

 A ray of light from an opened window discovered the pale face.

She left the room, and retired to one very near it; and sitting down on the floor, fixed her
eyes on the door of the apartment which contained the body. Every event of her life rushed
across her mind with wonderful rapidity--yet all was still--fate had given the finishing stroke.
She sat till midnight.--Then rose in a phrensy, went into the apartment, and desired those
who watched the body to retire.
