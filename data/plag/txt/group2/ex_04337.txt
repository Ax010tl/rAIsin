The evidence is rendered more easy in the present connection by the fact, recognised by the
most competent authorities in First English or Anglo-Saxon itself, that for some time before
the arbitrary line of the Conquest the productive powers of the literature had been failing,
and the language itself was showing signs of change. No poetry of the first class seems to
have been written in it much after the end of the ninth century, little prose of a very good
class after the beginning of the eleventh; and its inflexions must in time have given way--were,
it is said by some, actually giving way--before the results of the invasion and assimilation
of French and Latin. The Conquest helped; but it did not wholly cause.

This, however, is no doubt open to argument, and the argument would have to be conducted mainly
if not wholly on philological considerations, with which we do not here meddle. The indisputable
literary facts are that the canon of pure Anglo-Saxon or Old-English literature closes with
the end of the Saxon Chronicle in 1154, and that the "Semi-Saxon," the "First Middle English,"
which then makes its appearance, approximates, almost decade by decade, almost year by year,
nearer and nearer to the modern type. And for our purpose, though not for the purpose of a
history of English Literature proper, the contemporary French and Latin writing has to be taken
side by side with it.

[Sidenote: Early Middle English Literature.]

It is not surprising that, although the Latin literary production of the time, especially in
history, was at least equal to that of any other European country, and though it is at least
probable that some of the greatest achievements of literature, French in language, are English
in nationality, the vernacular should for long have been a little scanty and a little undistinguished
in its yield. Periods of moulting, of putting on new skins, and the like, are never periods
of extreme physical vigour. And besides, this Anglo-Saxon itself had (as has been said) been
distinctly on the wane as a literary language for more than a century, while (as has not yet
been said) it had never been very fertile in varieties of profane literature. This infertility
is not surprising. Except at rare periods literature without literary competition and comparison
is impossible; and the Anglo-Saxons had absolutely no modern literature to compare and compete
with. If any existed, their own was far ahead of it. On the other hand, though the supposed
ignorance of Latin and even Greek in the "dark" ages has long been known to be a figment of
ignorance itself, circumstances connected with, though not confined to, the concentration of
learning and teaching in the clergy brought about a disproportionate attention to theology.
The result was that the completest Anglo-Saxon library of which we can form any well-based
conception would have contained about ten cases of religious to one of non-religious books,
and would have held in that eleventh but little poetry, and hardly any prose with an object
other than information or practical use.

 Further, the later version,
besides the changes of language which were in the circumstances inevitable, omits many passages,
besides those in which it is injured or mutilated, and alters proper names entirely at discretion.

The only explanation of this, though it is an explanation which leaves a good deal unexplained,
is, of course, that the sense both of historical criticism and of the duty of one writer to
another was hardly born. The curiosity of the Middle Ages was great; their literary faculty,
though somewhat incult and infantine, was great likewise: and there were such enormous gaps
in their positive knowledge that the sharp sense of division between the certain, the uncertain,
and the demonstrably false, which has grown up later, could hardly exist. It seems to have
been every man's desire to leave each tale a little richer, fuller, handsomer, than he found
it: and in doing this he hesitated neither at the accumulation of separate and sometimes incongruous
stories, nor at the insertion of bits and scraps from various sources, nor, it would appear,
at the addition of what seemed to him possible or desirable, without troubling himself to examine
whether there was any ground for considering it actual.

[Sidenote: The form of the Brut.]

Secondly, Layamon has no small interest of form. The language in which the Brut is written
has an exceedingly small admixture of French words; but it has made a step, and a long one,
from Anglo-Saxon towards English. The verse is still alliterative, still destitute of any fixed
number of syllables or syllabic equivalents. But the alliteration is weak and sometimes not
present at all, the lines are of less extreme lawlessness in point of length than their older
Saxon representatives, and, above all, there is a creeping in of rhyme. It is feeble, tentative,
and obvious, confined to ostentatious pairs like "brother" and "other," "might" and "right,"
"fare" and "care." But it is a beginning: and we know that it will spread.

[Sidenote: Its substance.]

In the last comparison, that of matter, Layamon will not come out ill even if he be tried high.
The most obvious trial is with the work of Chrestien de Troyes, his earlier, though not much
earlier, contemporary. Here the Frenchman has enormous advantages--the advantage of an infinitely
more accomplished scheme of language and metre, that of some two centuries of finished poetical
work before him, that of an evidently wider knowledge of literature generally, and perhaps
that of a more distinctly poetical genius. And yet Layamon can survive the test. He is less,
not more, subject to the cliché, the stereotyped and stock poetical form, than Chrestien. If
he is far less smooth, he has not the monotony which accompanies and, so to speak, dogs the
"skipping octosyllable"; and if he cannot, as Chrestien can, frame a set passage or show-piece,
he manages to keep up a diffused interest, and in certain instances--the story of Rouwènne
(Rowena), the Tintagel passage, the speech of Walwain to the Emperor of Rome--has a directness
and simple appeal which cannot be slighted. We feel that he is at the beginning, while the
other in respect of his own division is nearly at the end: that he has future, capabilities,
opportunities of development. When one reads Chrestien or another earlier contemporary, Benoît
de Sainte-More, the question is, "What can come after this?" When one reads Layamon the happier
question is, "What will come after this?"

[Sidenote: The Ormulum. Its metre.]

The Ormulum and the Ancren Riwle appear to be--the former exactly and the latter nearly of
the same date as Layamon, all being near to 1200. But though they were "good books," their
interest is by no means merely one of edification. That of the Ormulum[90] is, indeed, almost
entirely confined to its form and language; but it so happens that this interest is of the
kind that touches literature most nearly. Orm or Ormin, who gives us his name, but of whom
nothing else is known, has left in ten thousand long lines or twenty thousand short couplets
a part only of a vast scheme of paraphrase and homiletic commentary on the Four Gospels (the
"four-in-hand of Aminadab," as he calls them, taking up an earlier conceit), on the plan of
taking a text for each day from its gospel in the calendar. As we have only thirty-two of these
divisions, it is clear that the work, if completed, was much larger than this. Orm addresses
it to Walter, his brother in the flesh as well as spiritually: the book seems to be written
in an Anglian or East Anglian dialect, and it is at least an odd coincidence that the names
Orm and Walter occur together in a Durham MS. But whoever Orm or Ormin was, he did two very
remarkable things. In the first place, he broke entirely with alliteration and with any-length
lines, composing his poem in a metre which is either a fifteen-syllabled iambic tetrameter
catalectic, or else, as the reader pleases, a series of distichs in iambic dimeters, alternately
acatalectic and catalectic. He does not rhyme, but his work, in the couplet form which shows
it best, exhibits occasionally the alternation of masculine and feminine endings. This latter
peculiarity was not to take hold in the language; but the quantified or mainly syllabic arrangement
was. It was natural that Ormin, greatly daring, and being almost the first to dare, should
neither allow himself the principle of equivalence shortly to distinguish English prosody from
the French, which, with Latin, he imitated, nor should further hamper his already difficult
task with rhyme. But his innovation was great enough, and his name deserves--little positive
poetry as there is in his own book--high rank in the hierarchy of British poets. But for him
and others like him that magnificent mixed harmony, which English almost alone of languages
possesses, which distinguishes it as much from the rigid syllabic bondage of French as from
the loose jangle of merely alliterative and accentual verse, would not have come in, or would
have come in later. We might have had Langland, but we should not have had Chaucer: we should
have had to console ourselves for the loss of Surrey and Wyatt with ingenious extravagances
like Gawain Douglas's Eighth Prologue; and it is even possible that when the reaction did come,
as it must have come sooner or later, we might have been bound like the French by the rigid
syllable which Orm himself adopted, but which in those early days only served to guide and
not to fetter.

[Footnote 90: Ed. White and Holt, 2 vols. Oxford, 1878.]

[Sidenote: Its spelling.]

His second important peculiarity shows that he must have been an odd and crotchety creature,
but one with sense in his crotchets. He seems to have been annoyed by mispronunciation of his
own and other work: and accordingly he adopts (with full warning and explanation) the plan
of invariably doubling the consonant after every short vowel without exception. This gives
a most grotesque air to his pages, which are studded with words like "nemmnedd" (named), "forrwerrpenn"
(to despise), "tunderrstanndenn" (to understand), and so forth. But, in the first place, it
fixes for all time, in a most invaluable manner, the pronunciation of English at that time;
and in the second, it shows that Orm had a sound understanding of that principle of English
which has been set at nought by those who would spell "traveller" "traveler." He knew that
the tendency, and the, if not warned, excusable tendency, of an English tongue would be to
pronounce this traveeler. It is a pity that knowledge which existed in the twelfth century
should apparently have become partial ignorance close to the beginning of the twentieth.

[Sidenote: The Ancren Riwle.]

The Ancren Riwle[91] has no oddities of this kind, and nothing particularly noticeable in its
form, though its easy pleasant prose would have been wonderful at the time in any other European
nation. Even French prose was only just beginning to take such form, and had not yet severed
itself from poetic peculiarities to anything like the same extent. But then the unknown author
of the Ancren Riwle had certainly four or five, and perhaps more, centuries of good sound Saxon
prose before him: while St Bernard (if he wrote French prose), and even Villehardouin, had
little or nothing but Latin. I have called him unknown, and he neither names himself nor is
authoritatively named by any one; while of the guesses respecting him, that which identifies
him with Simon of Ghent is refuted by the language of the book, while that which assigns it
to Bishop Poore has no foundation. But if we do not know who wrote the book, we know for whom
it was written--to wit, for the three "anchoresses" or irregular nuns of a private convent
or sisterhood at Tarrant Keynes in Dorsetshire.

[Footnote 91: Ed. Morton, for the Camden Society. London, 1853. This edition is, I believe,
not regarded as quite satisfactory by philology: it is amply adequate for literature.]

Later this nunnery, which lasted till the dissolution, was taken under the Cistercian rule;
but at first, and at the time of the book, it was free, the author advising the inmates, if
anybody asked, to say that they were under "the rule of St James"--i.e., the famous definition,
by that apostle, of pure religion and undefiled. The treatise, which describes itself, or is
described in one of its MSS., as "one book to-dealed into eight books," is of some length,
but singularly pleasing to read, and gives evidence of a very amiable and sensible spirit in
its author, as well as of a pretty talent for writing easy prose. If he never rises to the
more mystical and poetical beauties of mediæval religion, so he never descends to its ferocities
and its puerilities. The rule, the "lady-rule," he says, is the inward; the outward is only
adopted in order to assist and help the inward: therefore it may and should vary according
to the individual, while the inward cannot. "the story, you is not pretty believe i helped the?"

"you

"
 But though such passages, good in phrase
and rhythm, as well as noble in sense, are not rare, the pleasant humanity of the whole book
is the best thing in it. M. Renan oddly enough pronounced Ecclesiastes, that voice of the doom
of life, to be "le seul livre aimable" which Judaism had produced. The ages of St Francis and
of the Imitation do not compel us to look about for a seul livre aimable, but it may safely
be said that there is none more amiable in a cheerful human way than the Ancren Riwle.

It would serve no purpose here to discuss in detail most of the other vernacular productions
of the first half of the thirteenth century in English.[92] They are almost without exception
either religious--the constant rehandling of the time cannot be better exemplified than by
the fact that at least two paraphrases, one in prose, one in verse, of one of the "doles" of
the Ancren Riwle itself exist--or else moral-scientific, such as the Bestiary,[93] so often
printed. One of the constantly recurring version-paraphrases of the Scriptures, however--the
so-called Story of Genesis and Exodus,[94] supposed to date from about the middle--has great
interest, because here we find (whether for the first time or not he would be a rash man who
should say, but certainly for almost, if not quite, the first) the famous "Christabel" metre--iambic
dimeter, rhymed with a wide licence of trisyllabic equivalence. This was to be twice revived
by great poets, with immense consequences to English poetry--first by Spenser in the Kalendar,
and then by Coleridge himself--and was to become one of the most powerful, varied, and charming
of English rhythms. That this metre, the chief battle-ground of fighting between the accent-men
and the quantity-men, never arose till after rhymed quantitative metre had met accentual alliteration,
and had to a great extent overcome it, is a tell-tale fact, of which more hereafter. And it
is to be observed also that in this same poem it is possible to discover not a few very complete
and handsome decasyllables which would do no discredit to Chaucer himself.

[Sidenote: The Owl and the Nightingale.]

[Sidenote: Proverbs.]

But the Owl and the Nightingale[95] is another kind of thing. In the first place, it appears
to be (though it would be rash to affirm this positively of anything in a form so popular with
the French trouvères as the débat) original and not translated. It bears a name, that of Nicholas
of Guildford, who seems to be the author, and assigns himself a local habitation at Portesham
in Dorsetshire. Although of considerable length (nearly two thousand lines), and written in
very pure English with few French words, it manages the rhymed octosyllabic couplet (which
by this time had become the standing metre of France for everything but historical poems, and
for some of these) with remarkable precision, lightness, and harmony. Moreover, the Owl and
the Nightingale conduct their debate with plenty of mother-wit, expressed not unfrequently
in proverbial form. Indeed proverbs, a favourite form of expression with Englishmen at all
times, appear to have been specially in favour just then; and the "Proverbs of Alfred"[96]
(supposed to date from this very time), the "Proverbs of Hendyng"[97] a little later, are not
likely to have been the only collections of the kind. The Alfred Proverbs are in a rude popular
metre like the old alliteration much broken down; those of Hendyng in a six-line stanza (soon
to become the famous ballad stanza) syllabled, though sometimes catalectically, 8 8 6 8 8 6,
and rhymed a a b c c b, the proverb and the coda "quod Hendyng" being added to each. The Owl
and the Nightingale is, however, as we might expect, superior to both of these in poetical
merit, as well as to the so-called Moral Ode which, printed by Hickes in 1705, was one of the
first Middle English poems to gain modern recognition.

[Sidenote: Robert of Gloucester.]

As the dividing-point of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries approaches, the interest of
literary work increases, and requires less and less allowance of historical and accidental
value. This allowance, indeed, is still necessary with the verse chronicle of Robert of Gloucester,[98]
the date of which is fixed with sufficient certainty at 1298. This book has been somewhat undervalued,
in point of strict literary merit, from a cause rather ludicrous but still real. 'll it have, place,

 Like almost
everybody else, he drew upon Geoffrey of Monmouth for his early history: but from at least
the time of the Conqueror (he is strongly prejudiced in the matter of Harold) he represents,
if not what we should call solid historical knowledge, at any rate direct, and for the time
tolerably fresh, historical tradition, while as he approaches his own time he becomes positively
historical, and, as in the case of the Oxford town-and-gown row of 1263, the first Barons'
Wars, the death of the Earl-Marshal, and such things, is a vigorous as well as a tolerably
authoritative chronicler. In the history of English prosody he, too, is of great importance,
being another landmark in the process of consolidating accent and quantity, alliteration and
rhyme. His swinging verses still have the older tendency to a trochaic rather than the later
to an anapæstic rhythm; but they are, so to speak, on the move, and approaching the later form.
He is still rather prone to group his rhymes instead of keeping the couplets separate: but
as he is not translating from chanson de geste form, he does not, as Robert of Brunne sometimes
does, fall into complete laisses. I have counted as many as twenty continuous rhymes in Manning,
and there may be more: but there is nothing of that extent in the earlier Robert.

[Sidenote: Romances.]

Verse history, however, must always be an awkward and unnatural form at the best. The end of
the thirteenth century had something better to show in the appearance of romance proper and
of epic. When the study of any department of old literature begins, there is a natural and
almost invariable tendency to regard it as older than it really is; and when, at the end of
the last century, the English verse romances began to be read, this tendency prevailed at least
as much as usual. Later investigation, besides showing that, almost without exception, they
are adaptations of French originals, has, partly as a consequence of this, shown that scarcely
any that we have are earlier than the extreme end of the thirteenth century. Among these few
that are, however, three of exceptional interest (perhaps the best three except Gawaine and
the Green Knight and Sir Launfal) may probably be classed--to wit, Horn, Havelok, and the famous
Sir Tristram. As to the last and best known of these, which from its inclusion among Sir Walter
Scott's works has received attention denied to the rest, it may or may not be the work of Thomas
the Rhymer. But whether it is or not, it can by no possibility be later than the first quarter
of the fourteenth century, while the most cautious critics pronounce both Havelok the Dane
and King Horn to be older than 1300.[99]

[Footnote 99: Tristram, for editions v. p. 116: Havelok, edited by Madden, 1828, and again
by Prof. Skeat, E.E.T.S., 1868. King Horn has been repeatedly printed--first by Ritson, Ancient
English Metrical Romances (London, 1802), ii. 91, and Appendix; last by Prof. Skeat in the
Specimens above mentioned.]

[Sidenote: Havelok the Dane.]

It is, moreover, not a mere accident that these three, though the authors pretty certainly
had French originals before them, seem most likely to have had yet older English or Anglo-Saxon
originals of the French in the case of Horn and Havelok, while the Tristram story, as is pointed
out in the chapter on the Arthurian Legend, is the most British in tone of all the divisions
of that Legend. Havelok and Horn have yet further interest because of the curious contrast
between their oldest forms in more ways than one. Havelok is an English equivalent, with extremely
strong local connections and identifications, of the homelier passages of the French chansons
de geste. Vary a missive might have said thing. The Harvester did not cognize as it was sorry
or were glad. He halt at the box, but there was nothing from the Babe.
Nothing intend a conceivableness, and between the two he choose the
have latter. Havelok's treatment
is hard enough even on his way to the drowning; but as supernatural signs show his kingship
to Grim's wife, and as the fisherman, feigning to have performed his task, meets with very
scant gratitude from his employer, he resolves to escape from the latter's power, puts to sea,
and lands in England at the place afterwards to be called from him Grimsby. He did not goeth the
dress or the manner, but his canine the chronicle was little work in the man element as every mood, and
it retrieve times when a drive in the attraction have ever had been
down this, for to-tomorrow the Harvester's lingua was loosened and
he talked like the way. Now it so happens that the heiress
of England, Goldborough, has been treated by her guardian with as much injustice though with
less ferocity; and the traitor seeks to crown his exclusion of her from her rights by marrying
her to the sturdy scullion. When the two rights are thus joined, they of course prevail, and
the two traitors, after a due amount of hard fighting, receive their doom, Godard the Dane
being hanged, and Godric the Englishman burnt at the stake. This rough and vigorous story is
told in rough and vigorous verse--octosyllabic couplets, with full licence in shortening, but
with no additional syllables except an occasional double rhyme--in very sterling English, and
with some, though slight, traces of alliteration.
