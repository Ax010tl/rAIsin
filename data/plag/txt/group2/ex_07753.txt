[Sidenote: Liable for taxes.]

The homestead is liable for taxes accruing thereon, and if platted as hereinafter directed,
is liable only for such taxes and subject to mechanics' liens for work, labor, or material,
done or furnished exclusively for the improvement of the same, and the whole or a sufficient
portion thereof may be sold to pay the same. [§3166.] All the taxes against the owner of the
homestead become liens thereon, unless it is platted as directed by statute.

[Sidenote: Liable for debts.]

The homestead may be sold on execution for debts contracted prior to the purchase thereof,
but it shall not in such case be sold except to supply the deficiency remaining after exhausting
the other property of the debtor liable to execution. [§3167.] Debts contracted after the acquisition
of the property, but before it has acquired the homestead character by actual occupancy, may
be enforced against the property. A judgment upon a debt contracted prior to the purchase of
the homestead, although such judgment is not rendered until after the property has acquired
the homestead character, is a lien upon the homestead.

[Sidenote: Debts created by written contract.]

The homestead may be sold for debts created by written contract, executed by the persons having
the power to convey and expressly stipulating that the homestead is liable therefor, but it
shall not in such case be sold except to supply the deficiency remaining after exhausting the
other property pledged for the payment of the debt in the same written contract. [§3168.] Any
written contract other than a mortgage or other conveyance, will be sufficient to render the
homestead liable for debts, provided it contains the necessary stipulations, and is signed
by the proper parties.

[Sidenote: What constitutes.]

The homestead must embrace the house used as a home by the owner thereof, and if he has two
or more houses thus used by him at different times and places, he may select which he will
retain as his homestead. [§3159.] The husband may select his homestead and make the same his
home without the consent of his wife, and the absence of the wife will not affect its homestead
character. The fact that the husband is the legal head of the family invests him with the power
of establishing his home wherever he may choose, with or without the assent of his wife. Use
is essential to give property a homestead character, and an intention to occupy is not sufficient
in the absence of actual residence.

[Sidenote: Embraces what.]

It may contain one or more lots or tracts of land with the buildings thereon and other appurtenances,
subject to the limitations contained in the next section, but must in no case embrace different
lots or tracts, unless they are contiguous, or unless they are habitually and in good faith
used as a part of the same homestead. [§3170.]

[Sidenote: Extent.]

If within a town plat it must not exceed one-half an acre in extent, and if not within a town
plat, it must not embrace in the aggregate more than forty acres. But if, when thus limited,
in either case, its value is less than five hundred dollars, it may be enlarged until it reaches
that amount. [§3171.]

[Sidenote: Dwelling appurtenances.]

It must not embrace more than one dwelling house, or any other buildings except as such are
properly appurtenant to the homestead; but a shop or other building situated thereon, and really
used and occupied by the owner in the prosecution of his own ordinary business, and not exceeding
three hundred dollars in value, may be deemed appurtenant to such homestead. [§3172.]

[Sidenote: Selecting. Platting.]

The owner or the husband or wife, may select the homestead and cause it to be marked out, platted,
and recorded as provided in the next section. A failure in this respect does not leave the
homestead liable, but the officer having an execution against the property of such defendant,
may cause the homestead to be marked off, platted and recorded and may add the expense thence
arising to the amount embraced in the execution. [§3173.]

[Sidenote: Description. Recording.]

The homestead shall be marked off by fixed and visible monuments, and in giving the description
thereof, the direction and distance of the starting point from some corner of the dwelling-house
shall be stated. The description and plat shall then be recorded by the recorder in a book
to be called the "homestead book," which shall be provided with a proper index. [§3174.]

[Sidenote: Changes.]

The owner may from time to time change the limits of the homestead by changing the metes and
bounds, as well as the record of the plat and description, or may change it entirely, but such
changes shall not prejudice conveyances or liens made or created previously thereto, and no
change of the entire homestead made without the concurrence of the husband or wife, shall affect
his or her right or those of the children. [§3175.]

[Sidenote: New homestead exempt.]

The new homestead, to the extent in value of the old, is exempt from execution in all cases
where the old or former homestead would have been exempt, but in no other, nor in any greater
degree. [§3176.]

[Sidenote: Survivor to occupy.]

Upon the death of either husband or wife, the survivor may continue to possess and occupy the
whole homestead until it is disposed of according to law. [§3182.] The survivor may elect to
retain the homestead in lieu of his or her distributive stare of the estate, but in such case
the interest is not one which confers any title to the property which can be conveyed or which
will descend to heirs or be subject to the lieu of a judgment, but it is merely a life interest
which may be terminated whenever the survivor ceases to use and occupy the homestead as such.
Whenever the survivor elects to retain the homestead during life in lieu of dower, it cannot
be changed for another homestead, and the right will be lost by abandonment.

[Sidenote: Election to retain. Descent. Exemption.]

The setting off of the distributive share of the husband or wife in the real estate of the
deceased, shall be such a disposal of the homestead as is contemplated in the preceding section.
But the survivor may elect to retain the homestead for life in lieu of such share in the real
estate of the deceased; but if there be no such survivor, the homestead descends to the issue
of either husband or wife according to the rules of descent, unless otherwise directed by will,
and is to be held by such issue exempt from any antecedent debts of their parents or their
own. [§3183.]

[Sidenote: When sold.]

If there is no such survivor or issue the homestead is liable to be sold for the payment of
any debts to which it might at that time be subjected, if it had never been held as a homestead.
[§3184.]

[Sidenote: Devise.]

Subject to the rights of the surviving husband or wife, as declared by law, the homestead may
be devised like other real estate of the testator. When we sleep in period had the control that
suitably supplement the banquet. The was keep of and on night, as those modification but one traveler
