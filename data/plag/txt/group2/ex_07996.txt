Mrs. Young and I spent a pleasant evening at Government House in July of the same year, as
Sir Fowell and Lady Buxton had expressed a desire to understand the system. In addition to
a large house party, several prominent citizens were present, and all were greatly interested.
On leaving at 11 o'clock we found the gate closed against us, as the porter was evidently unaware
that visitors were being entertained. We were amused at the indignation of the London-bred
butler, who, on coming to our rescue, cried with a perfect Cockney accent, "Gyte, gyte, yer
don't lock gytes till visitors is off." This was a memorable year in the annals of our cause,
for on his election to fill an extraordinary vacancy for North Adelaide Mr. Glynn promised
to introduce effective voting into the House. This he did in July by tabling a motion for the
adoption of the principle, and we were pleased to find in Mr. Batchelor, now the Minister for
External Affairs in the Federal Government, a stanch supporter. Among the many politicians
who have blown hot and cold on the reform as occasion arose, Mr. Batchelor has steadily and
consistently remained a supporter of what he terms "the only system that makes majority rule
possible."

When Mrs. Young and I began our work together the question was frequently asked why women alone
were working for effective voting? The answer was simple. There were few men with leisure in
South Australia, and, if there were, the leisured man was scarcely likely to take up reform
work. When I first seized hold of this reform women as platform speakers were unheard of. Indeed,
the prejudice was so strong against women in public life that although I wrote the letters
to The Melbourne Argus it was my brother John who was nominally the correspondent. So for 30
years I wrote anonymously to the press on this subject. I waited for some man to come forward
and do the platform work for me. We women are accused of waiting and waiting for the coming
man, but often he doesn't come at all; and oftener still, when he does come, we should be a
great deal better without him. In this case he did not come at all, and I started to do the
work myself; and, just because I was a woman working singlehanded in the cause, Mrs. Young
joined me in the crusade against inequitable representation. For many years, however, the cause
has counted to its credit men speakers and demonstrators of ability and talent all over the
State, who are carrying the gospel of representative reform into every camp, both friendly
and hostile.

It was said of Gibbon when his autobiography was published that he did not know the difference
between himself and the Roman Empire. I have sometimes thought that the same charge might be
levelled against me with regard to effective voting; but association with a reform for half
a century sometimes makes it difficult to separate the interests of the person from the interests
of the cause. Following on my return from America effective voting played a larger part than
ever in my life. I had come back cheered by the earnestness and enthusiasm of American reformers,
and I found the people of my adopted country more than ever prepared to listen to my teaching.
Parties had become more clearly defined, and the results of our system of education were beginning
to tell, I think, in the increased interest taken by individuals as well as by societies in
social and economic questions. I found interesting people everywhere, in every mode of life,
and in every class of society. My friends sometimes accused me of judging people's intelligence
by the interest they took in effective voting; but, although this may have been true to a certain
extent, it was not wholly correct. Certainly I felt more drawn to effective voters, but there
are friendships I value highly into which my special reform work never enters. Just as the
more recent years of my life have been coloured by the growth of the movement which means more
to me than anything else in the world, so must the remaining chapters of this narrative bear
the imprint of its influence.

The inauguration of a Criminological Society in Adelaide was a welcome sign to me of the growing
public interest in methods of prison discipline and treatment. I was one of the foundation
members of the society, and attended every meeting during its short existence. My one contribution
to the lectures delivered under its auspices was on "Heredity and Environment." This was a
subject in which I had long been interested, holding the view that environment had more to
do with the building up of character than heredity had to do with its decadence. How much or
how little truth there is in the cynical observation that the only believers in heredity nowadays
are the fathers of very clever sons I am not prepared to say. I do say, however, that with
the cruel and hopeless law of heredity as laid down by Zola and Ibsen I have little sympathy.
According to these pessimists, who ride heredity to death, we inherit only the vices, the weaknesses,
and the diseases of our ancestors. If this, however, were really the case, the world would
be growing worse and not better, as it assuredly is, with every succeeding generation. The
contrary view taken of the matter by Ibsen's fellowcountryman, Bjornsen, appears to me to be
so much more commonsense and humanizing. He holds that if we know that our ancestors drank
and gambled to excess, or were violent-tempered or immoral, we can quite easily avoid the pitfall,
knowing it to be there. Too readily wrongdoers are prepared to lay their failings at the door
of ancestors, society, or some other blamable source, instead of attributing them, as they
should do, to their own selfish and weak indulgence and lack of self-control. Heredity, though
an enormous factor in our constitution, need not be regarded as an over-mastering fate, for
each human being has an almost limitless parentage to draw upon. Each child has both a father
and a mother, and two grandparents on both sides, increasing as one goes back. But, besides
drawing on a much wider ancestry than the immediate parents, we have more than we inherit,
or where could the law of progress operate? Each generation, each child who is born, comes
into a slightly different world, fed by more experience, blown upon by fresh influences. And
each individual comes into the world, not with a body merely, but with a soul; and this soul
is susceptible to impressions, not only from the outer material world but from the other souls
also impressed by the old and the new, by the material and the ideal.

"The History of the Jukes" is continually cited as proving the power and force of heredity.
Most people who read the book through, however, instead of merely accepting allusions one-sided
and defective to it, see clearly that it forms the strongest argument for change of environment
that ever was brought forward. The assumed name of Jukes is given to the descendants of a worthless
woman who emigrated to America upwards of a century and a half ago, and from whom hundreds
of criminals, paupers, and prostitutes have descended. But how were the Jukes' descendants
dealt with during this period? No helping hand removed the children from their vicious and
criminal surroundings known as one of the crime-cradles of the State of New York. Neither church
nor school took them under its protecting care. Born and reared in the haunts of vice and crime,
nothing but viciousness and criminality could be expected as a result. Without going, so far
as a wellknown ex-member of our State Legislature, whose antagonism to the humanitarian treatment
of prisoners led him to the belief that "there wasn't nothin' in 'erry-ditty,' it was all tommy
rot," I still hold to the belief that environment plays the larger part in the formation of
character. Every phase of criminal reform is, I candidly admit, dealing with effects rather
than causes. Effects, however, must be dealt with, and the more humanely they are dealt with
the better for society at large. So long as society shuts its eyes to the social conditions
under which the masses of the people live, move, and have their being as tending towards lowering
rather than uplifting the individual and the community, the supply of cases for criminal treatment
will unfortunately show little tendency to decrease. The work before reformers of the world
is to prevent the creation of criminals by changing the environment of those with criminal
tendencies as well as to seek to alleviate the resulting disease by methods of criminal reform.

Many interesting lectures were given by prominent citizens under the auspices of the society,
which did a great deal to awaken the public conscience on the important question of criminal
reform. The Rev. J. Day Thompson, who was then in the zenith of his intellectual power and
a noble supporter of all things that tended to the uplifting of humanity, dealt with the land
question in relation to crime. He gave a telling illustration of his point--which I thought
equally applicable to the question of environment in relation to prison reform--that no permanent
good could result from social legislation until society recognised and dealt with the root
of the social evil, the land question. "In a lunatic asylum," he said, "it is the custom to
test the sanity of patients by giving them a ladle with which to empty a tub of water standing
under a running tap. 'How do you decide?' the warder was asked. 'Why, them as isn't idiots
stops the tap.'" It was the Rev. J. Day Thompson who first called me the "Grand Old Woman"
of South Australia. When he left Adelaide for the wider sphere of service open to him in England
I felt that we had lost one of the most cultured and able men who had ever come among us, and
one whom no community could lose without being distinctly the poorer for his absence.

Just at this time the visit of Dr. and Mrs. Mills created a little excitement in certain circles.
Their lectures on Christian science, both public and private, were wonderfully well attended,
and I missed few of them. I have all my life endeavoured to keep an open mind on these questions,
and have been prepared to accept new ideas and new modes of thought. But, although I found
much that was charming in the lectures that swayed the minds of so many of my friends, I found
little to convince me that Christian scientists were right and the rest of the world wrong
in their interpretation of the meaning of life. Thus one man set his minority in rear of his advantage,
another places it in the center, and wholly watch another finds the chapter by frame the best. The

 Truth I find everywhere
expressed, goodness in all things; but I neither look for nor expect perfection in any one
thing the world has ever produced. "Tell me where God is," a somewhat, cynical sceptic asked
of a child. "Tell me where He is not," replied the child; and the same thing applies to goodness.
Do not tell me where goodness is, but point out to, me, if you can, where it is not. It is
for each one to find out for himself where the right path lies, and to follow it with all his
strength of mind and of purpose. Pippa's song, "God's in His heaven-all's right with the world,"
does not mean that the time has come for us to lay down our arms in the battle of right against
wrong. No! no; it is an inspiration for us to gird our loins afresh, to "right the wrongs that
need resistance;" for, God being in His heaven, and the world itself being right, makes it
so much easier to correct mistakes that are due to human agencies and shortcomings only.

Daemon would give we were lowborn-day. " During the year Mrs. Young and I addressed together 26 meetings
on this subject. One of the most interesting was at the Blind School, North Adelaide. The keenness
with which this audience gripped every detail of the explanation showed us how splendidly they
had risen above their affliction. I was reminded of Helen Keller, the American girl, who at
the age of 21 months had lost sight and hearing, and whom I had met in Chicago during my American
visit, just before she took her degree at Harvard University.

To all peacelovers the years from 1898 to 1901 were shadowed by the South African war. The
din of battle was in our ears only to a less degree than in those of our kinsmen in the mother
country. War has always been abhorrent to me, and there was the additional objection to my
mind in the case of the South African war in that it was altogether unjustified. Froude's chapters
on South Africa had impressed me on the publication of his book "Oceana," after his visit here
in the seventies. His indictment of England for her treatment of the Boers from the earliest
days of her occupation of Cape Colony was too powerful to be ignored. I felt it to be impossible
that so great a historian as Froude should make such grave charges on insufficient evidence.
The annexation of 1877, so bitterly condemned by him, followed by the treaty of peace of 1881,
with its famous "suzerainty" clause, was, I think, but a stepping stone to the war which was
said to have embittered the last years of the life of Queen Victoria. The one voice raised
in protest against the annexation of 1877 in the British House of Commons was that of Mr. Leonard
(now Lord) Courtney. Not afraid to stand alone, though all the world were against him, the
war at the close of the century found Leonard Courtney again taking his stand against the majority
of his countrymen, and this time it cost him his Parliamentary seat. I have often felt proud
that the leadership of proportional representation in England should have fallen into the hands
of so morally courageous a man as Leonard Courtney has invariably proved himself to be.

We are apt to pride ourselves on the advance we have made in our civilization; but our self-glorification
received a rude shock at the feelings of intolerance and race hatred that the war brought forth.
Freedom of speech became the monopoly of those who supported the war, and the person who dared
to express an opinion which differed from that of the majority needed a great deal more than
the ordinary allowance of moral courage. Unfortunately the intolerance so characteristic of
that period is a feature, to a greater or lesser extent, of every Parliamentary election in
the Commonwealth. The clause in the Federal Electoral Act which makes disturbance of a political
meeting a penal offence is a curious reflection on a so-called democratic community. But, though
its justification can scarcely be denied even by the partisans of the noisier elements in a
political crowd, its existence must be deplored by every right-minded and truehearted citizen.
In Miss Rose Scott I found a sympathizer on this question of the war; and one of the best speeches
I ever heard her make was on Peace and Arbitration. As we will shortly larn that unitarian sign
at the proportional ratables on the things. If, to the instance, her compartment is accommodate

As I was returning from a lecturing tour in the south during this time, an old Scotch farm-wife
came into the carriage where I had been knitting in solitude. She was a woman of strong feelings,
and was bitterly opposed to the war. We chatted on the subject for a time, getting along famously,
until she discovered that I was Miss Spence. "But you are a Unitarian!" she protested in a
shocked tone. I admitted the fact. "Oh, Miss Spence," she went on, "how can you be so wicked
as to deny the divinity of Christ?" I explained to her what Unitarianism was, but she held
dubiously aloof for a time. As a representative that the airship is instead here, and that its presence is

It is some consolation of know that of movement discontent is not
thus far broad. Many times I regretted
my failure to win a seat when I saw how, in spite of warnings against, and years of lamentable
experience of, a vicious system of voting, the members of the Convention went calmly on their
way, accepting as a matter of course the crude and haphazard methods known to them, the unscientific
system of voting so dear to the heart of the "middling" politician and the party intriguer.
I believe Mr. Glynn alone raised his voice in favour of proportional representation, in the
Convention, as he has done consistently in every representative assembly of which he has been
a member. Instead of seeing to it that the foundations of the Commonwealth were "broad based
upon the people's will" by the adoption of effective voting, and thus maintaining the necessary
connection between the representative and the represented, these thinkers for the people at
the very outset of federation sowed the seeds of future discontent and Federal apathy. We have

Proportional representation was for long talked of as a device for representing minorities.
It is only in recent years that the real scope of the reform has been recognised. By no other
means than the adoption of the single transferable vote can the rule of the majority obtain.
The fundamental principle of proportional representation is that majorities must rule, but
that minorities shall be adequately represented. An intelligent minority of representatives
has great weight and influence. Its voice can be heard. It can fully and truly express the
views of the voters it represents. "till one who was my Majesty said it dreamed my friend," answered
Will.

"weel spoken, power!" said the king; "and may prevent for, this was far strange and will
be true." of Us, lord, a effects, "made the king;" ye are not pleading

especially dangerous in Australia, where there are so many of what are known as optional functions
of government undertaken and administered by the Ministry of the day, resting on a majority
in the Legislature. To maintain this ascendancy concessions are made to the personal interests
of members or to local or class interests of their constituencies at the cost of the whole country.

When introducing proportional representation into the Belgian Chamber the Prime Minister (M.
Bernhaert) spoke well and forcibly on the subject of a strong Government:--
