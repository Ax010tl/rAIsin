As Denmark is a kingdom composed mainly of islands and peninsula, she has a long line of sea-board
to defend, and a good navy is essential for her safety. The Danes being descendants of Vikings
and sea-rovers, you may be sure that their navy is well maintained.

A boy who chooses the navy as his profession must leave school at the age of fourteen years,
and go for nine months' training on a warship as a voluntary apprentice. At the end of this
time he knows whether he likes the profession well enough to join it--if so, two years' coaching
is given to enable him to pass the necessary examinations for entering the Naval Academy. Here
he is trained for four years, spending the four summer months of each year in cruising. This
Naval Academy, where officers are trained, is a fine old institution, and prides itself on
the record of the famous men it has turned out. The present King of Greece, and many other
members of the Danish Royal Family, have also been trained at this Academy. The Academy course
is expensive, and as promotion is slow, and pay small in the navy, the Lieutenants are sometimes
permitted to captain a ship in the merchant service for three years. This they are glad to
do, as it increases their pay and knowledge of navigation. Denmark being too small to maintain
a large cruising fleet, these officers would have little opportunity of proving their sailing
powers without this arrangement.

When cruising, the high spirits of the young cadets sometimes lead them into mischief, thereby
bringing trouble upon their heads. I knew a naval captain who hit upon a very original and
effective form of punishment for wrong-doers. The cadet cap is a blue "tam-o'-shanter" with
the usual woolly bob of the same colour on the top. "The naughty boys shall have a red bob,"
said the "Kaptejn," "and thus be branded for misdemeanour!" The culprits disliked this badge
intensely, I imagine mostly because their comrades derisively admired the colour which made
them conspicuous. One day royalties were being shown over the ship, and a young Princess asked
"why some of the boys had those pretty red tufts on their caps?" You may imagine the chagrin
and confusion of the culprits; scarlet faces and crimson tufts told their own tale! The boys,
you may be sure, thought twice in future before risking another penitential week of branding
and ridicule for breach of discipline.

In Copenhagen one of the discarded warships is used as public restaurant and training-school
for ships' cooks. Here the sailor-men are taught every branch of cooking and kitchen-work.
When trained, these cooks are employed on the merchant-ships, as well as on the men-of-war.

Some interesting stories are told of the naval heroes of Denmark which you will like to hear.
Peder Tordenskjold is the Nelson of Denmark. This man, besides being a great Admiral, was a
most genial character, and had a striking and original personality. Many true tales are told
about this hero which the young Danish lads never tire of hearing. There is a favourite one
which tells of the ingenious way by which he discovered the weak points in his enemy's stronghold.
Dressing himself as a fisherman, he accompanied two other fishers in a little rowing-boat laden
with fish to the enemy's shores. Taking a basket of fish, he mounted the hill to the fort,
saying he had brought the fish for the commandant. He was allowed to pass in to the fort with
his fish, and, pretending stupidity, kept losing his way--gaining knowledge thereby--till he
reached the commandant's residence. Gaining permission from the latter to supply the garrison
with fish, he inquired for how many men he should provide. "Let me see," said the commandant,
half to himself, "a hundred guns--two hundred men; you may bring fish for a hundred men." Tordenskjold
then left the fort, having obtained all the information he required, and returned to his boat.
At this moment the captain of one of the ships lying in the bay arrived on shore, and the pretended
fisherman at once accosted him, asking permission to serve his men with fish. This being granted,
he at once rowed to the ship, where he soon disposed of his fish, and conversing with the sailors,
he gained the information that in two days' time there would be a great festivity held on shore,
at which most of them would be present. With this valuable knowledge he returned to his own
shore from the Swedish coast, and laid plans which gave Denmark a victory and proved fatal
to the Swedes. In Holmens Kirke, where this hero lies buried, a splendid black marble tomb
has been erected to his memory by King Frederik IV. Near by lies another naval hero, Niels
Juel, whose gilt and copper coffin is surmounted by a tablet which tells of his brave deeds.

Captain Hvitfeldt, the hero of Kjöge Bay, blew up his ship with three hundred men to save the
Danish fleet from destruction. In the war of 1710, between Denmark and Sweden, this captain's
ship, the Danebrog, took fire. To save the ships which were being driven by the wind towards
his burning vessel, he and his gallant crew sacrificed their lives.

Herluf Trolle was a Danish noble and a famous Admiral, who left all his wealth to found a school
for orphans. His noble wife, Fru Bergitta, was greatly distressed that the Admiral's will could
not be found, as she was most anxious that his wishes, which were also her own, with regard
to the school, should be carried into effect. The Admiral's relatives would inherit the property,
and were already clamouring for it, when one night Fru Bergitta had a dream. She dreamed she
saw someone walking round her husband's writing-table, attentively inspecting the legs. These
she examined on awakening, and found one to be hollow. Discovering a secret spring, she pressed
it, and beheld the will lying in the hollow space. So Herluf Trolle's school was founded, and
although this brave old Admiral died from wounds received in battle centuries ago, yet his
school is considered to be one of the best at the present day.

CHAPTER XII

THE PEOPLE OF THE ISLES

One of the most storm-swept and barren of Denmark's many islands is the island of Fanö. Lying,
as it does, exposed to the full force of the North Sea gales, it yet serves to protect the
harbour of Esbjerg from these storms. It is eight miles long, and three miles at its broadest
part. A trim little steamer will carry you across from Esbjerg to Nordby--the fishing town
on the east coast of Fanö--in twenty minutes. Nordby is both quaint and picturesque. The low
thatched houses, with rough-cast, whitewashed walls, nestle close to each other for shelter
from the winds.

The Fanö women have a practical but peculiar costume; the thickly-pleated skirt has a bright-coloured
border, while the close-fitting bodice is adorned with embroidery, and pretty antique buttons.
A folded cotton kerchief and accordion-pleated apron give a daintiness to the whole dress.
The head-dress, however, gives the most singular finish to the costume. A dark, checked-bordered
handkerchief tied over a stiff, cambric frame, entirely envelops the head. The four ends of
this handkerchief are tied in an odd way, two being left upstanding like rabbits' ears! This
striking head-dress gives the Fanö wife a fantastic appearance. When the good-natured, smiling
faces of these women are hidden behind a mask, the combination of dress and mask makes them
awesome-looking folk. The men of the island are nearly all fishermen; the women are the farmers,
and it is to protect their faces from the blinding sand-storms, while working on the land,
that these masks are worn. This mask obliterates all comeliness, for only the eyes peep out
from the weird face-protector.

This island of heath, dune, and quicksand is wild and romantic. The cultivated fields are protected
by sand-hills, and belts of stunted, wind-swept trees that afford some slight protection to
the crops. The island belongs to the people, who cultivate it assiduously. The courage and
perseverance of these women agriculturalists is rewarded by fair crops, notwithstanding an
adverse climate.

At the south end of the island, far away from any dwelling, is the interesting "Fugleköjerne,"[9]
where three or four hundred wild-duck are taken in a day during the season. Decoy-ducks are
used for this purpose.

The west side of the island is the most fashionable watering-place in Denmark. Large hotels
and pretty villas line the shore, and here the well-to-do Danes inhale bracing sea-breezes.

On a windy day this western shore is not amusing. Clouds of blinding sand whirl high in the
air, while the booming surf rolls and plunges on the beach with deafening roar, and makes rank
and fashion fly to shelter in hotel or villa till the storm is over. Visitors in summer and
storms in winter have it all their own way on this west coast--the people of Fanö trouble it not.

Bornholm, situated in the middle of the Baltic, is both beautiful and fertile. Its products
are very valuable to Denmark. From here comes the clay of which the exquisite Copenhagen porcelain
is made. Here, too, the granite for building the country's defences and docks is quarried.
I fancy if you were to ask a young Dane what Bornholm is most famed for he would say, "Turkeys,"
for the island supplies the Copenhagen market with these birds.

The chief town, Rönne, is charming, with its many low-roofed houses, which overlook the Baltic.
It is noted for its terra-cotta ware, clocks, and Museum of Antiquities.

Most of the towns are upon the coast. Four singular round churches, built of granite, were
formerly used as places of refuge for the people when beset by pirates. These "Rundkirker"
are peculiar to Bornholm.

A high festival is celebrated every year on the anniversary of the day when the inhabitants
succeeded in throwing off the Swedish yoke, which they had borne for a short time in the seventeenth
century with resentment.

Hammershus Castle, on the northern extremity of Bornholm, was built in the thirteenth century.
There is a sad tale connected with this romantic castle, about a Danish noble and his wife.
This noble, Corfitz Ulfeldt, was imprisoned there for treason. His beautiful wife, Eleonora,
the favourite daughter of Christian IV., accompanied him, preferring imprisonment with him
to liberty without him. After the Count died, Eleonora, who had a mortal enemy in Queen Caroline
Amalia, was sent by the latter to the "Blaataarn"[10] of Slotsholmen, Copenhagen, and there
incarcerated for twenty-two years. The illustrious Eleonora was only liberated on the death
of the vindictive Queen, but the long years of captivity--without reason--had wrecked her life.

Læsö is a small island in the Cattegat, the inhabitants of which are mainly farmers and fishermen,
and the old women wear a particular costume for Sunday, which is called the "church costume."

The people of Amager are great market-gardeners. They are of Dutch extraction. Christian II.,
after flying from his country, took refuge in Holland, and some of the Dutch helped him in
trying to regain his throne. For this service he gave his Dutch followers the island of Amager.
The descendants of these Dutch people still retain their old customs and characteristics. Clattering
about in wooden shoes, the old women, in quaint costume, may be seen driving their geese down
the picturesque streets to the meadows. Besides being market-gardeners and florists, these
Amager folk rear and fatten the geese for the Christmas market.

The natural beauty of the island of Möen is striking, and unlike the rest of Denmark. "Möen's
Klint" are great, jagged white cliffs rising abruptly from the sea. Enchanting beech-woods
thickly crown the summit, giving distinctive and unusual beauty to it. From Sommerspiret, the
highest point, we have an extensive view over the Østersöen and Köjge Bay, where the famous
victory over the Swedes was won by Niels Juel in 1677.

In Denmark the town-crier beats a drum to draw attention to the notice he is about to give.

Danish postmen present a gorgeous appearance, in red coats, with smart cloaks of the same brilliant
hue for winter wear. These and the bright yellow mail-vans, which they drive sometimes, arrest
attention, and give importance to the carriers of His Majesty's mails.

In many of the houses the "Forhöjning" is still used. This is a raised platform close to the
window, on which the lady of the house sits to do her embroidery. Superior, i is monarch; atter, faith.
Queen have their turmoil. It is a atter. There is ability. But, after all, already all his content

You should see this coast on a stormy day, more especially at Grenen, where those two mighty
seas, the Skagerack and Cattegat, meet. When the tempest rages here, far as eye can see a long
ridge of seething, tossing water denotes the meeting-place of the currents. The great "white
horses" in battle array fight, plunge, and roar--each striving for the mastery which neither
gains. This wrestling-match is a splendid spectacle to those who are safe on shore, also to
those at sea if the day is clear, because they can then give the reef a wide berth. Tossing
spray is thrown high into the air and wind-borne to the shore, so even at a distance from the
waves you may have a salt shower-bath should you be able to "keep your legs" against the fury
of the gale. The screaming gulls which fly around, dipping and rising, enjoying as only "storm-birds"
can the roar and tumult of these tempestuous waters, enhance the fierce loneliness of the scene.
This awe-inspiring "Nature-barrier" saddens you--even while you exult in the madness of its
fury--when you think what it means on a foggy night to the poor mariner. What a comfort for
the seafarer to know that there is such a famous race of fishermen here, willing and ready
to man the life-boat and rescue them from the angry, engulfing waters! You would never guess
these seas could be otherwise than kind when you enter their smiling depths for a swim on a
calm, sunny day. How gentle and invigorating they can be the fishermen as well as the visitors
know, and any morning you may see the former returning from their daily dip with dripping heads
and towels along the shore. Somehow these fishermen are always picturesque. In the summer evening,
sitting or lying on the sunlit beach, smoking their cutty-pipes and waiting for the time to
launch their boats for the fishing, they make an impressive picture. Kindly blue eyes and weather-beaten
faces look at you from under the sou'westers, while blue jerseys, long sea-boots with curled-over
tops and oil-skins, complete the sea-going outfit. Fully equipped, they charm the eye of the
most fastidious, and it is little wonder that they have become subjects for famous artists
and poets.

These fishermen are very devout, and before launching their boat they all stand round it with
clasped hands and bowed heads, offering up a short, silent prayer for help and protection on
these dangerous waters. Then, pushing the boat out into the water, they jump in while it floats--sea-boots
getting wet in the process--and wave farewell to their children on the shore, who cry in return
"Farvel Fa'er!"

Lars Kruse, the late captain of the life-boat at Skagen, has had a beautiful monument raised
to his memory, and his son will show you with great pride the cups and medals he left behind
as mementoes of his brave deeds. These medals have been presented by many different nations
whose sea-farers have been saved by him. Amongst these is one given by Queen Victoria.

Captain Larsen, a well-known mariner, who, on retiring from his post on one of the light-ships,
settled at Old Skagen, has left a unique collection to the village. This now constitutes a
museum of exquisitely carved furniture, much of it inlaid with ivory, marbles and metals in
dainty designs, all made by this old sailor during the last twelve years of his life--a wonderful
record of industry. Old Skagen is a quaint fisher-village, nestling behind the sand-dunes,
trying to shelter itself from the sand and sea-storms to which these shores are subjected.

Many of these fisher-folk are farmers also, tilling and cultivating the heath-lands which lie
beyond the village. The fisher cottages are quite pretty, with thatched or red-tiled roofs,
white or buff rough-cast walls, green painted doors and windows, with black painted foundations
which protect them from the sand. Bright flowering plants in the windows and the neat and clean
appearance of the whole betoken the joy and comfort that reigns in the fisherman's home. Many
household duties are performed at the cottage door in the sandy enclosure surrounding the little
homestead. Here the old men mend the nets, keeping a watchful eye on the babies, while the
women clean and salt the fish, hanging them up in rows to dry in the sun. In these garden enclosures,
also, many quaintly pretty miniature houses may be seen erected on tall poles. These are to
encourage the starlings and other songsters to settle in them, as there are no trees. Hen-roosts
and outhouses are adorned with the name-boards of wrecked boats washed up on the shore, while
discarded boats turned over and tarred make the roofs of these curious shelters worthy of royal
hens!

The older fishermen have a safe and effective way of trawling from the strand. Putting out
in a small boat, taking their net with them, to which a long rope is attached--the end of this
being left in charge of the fishermen on the shore--they row gaily over the water, paying out
the rope as they go. When the limit of this rope is reached, the men drop their weighted net
overboard and pull for the shore, bringing with them another attached rope which is paid out
till they reach the strand. When they have landed and the boat is beached, half a dozen men
or more take hold of each rope--these are fastened to each side of the submerged net--and begin
hauling it to the shore. The straining muscles of the men as they march up the beach with a
strong, steady, overhand pull on the rope denotes that this is heavy work. It is a grand sight!
As the net nears the shore the gleaming, glittering mass of fish can be seen leaping and jumping
in vain endeavour to escape from their prison, only the smaller fry succeeding. At last the
net with its silver load reaches the shore with the noise as of a great wave breaking upon
the beach, which is caused by the efforts of the fish to gain their freedom. The best fish
are picked out and the others returned to the sea, while the gulls swoop down with querulous
cry and gobble all that float on the surface of the water. These fishermen have a prejudice
against skate, and use it only for bait.

St. Clement is the patron saint of Danish fishermen, and many of the churches in the coast
towns are dedicated to him.

As the Cathedral of Aarhus is dedicated to St. Clement, the Skaw fishermen have given an exquisite
model of a ship to the church. This ship is a perfect representation in miniature of a man-of-war.
It was made in Holland for Peter the Great, but the ship which carried it was wrecked near
Grenen, and the model was saved by the Skaw fishermen.

CHAPTER XIV

YOUTHFUL DANES AT WORK AND PLAY

Denmark is renowned for its educational system and for its schools. These schools are all under
Government control, and meet the wants of every class. The authorities are upheld by the parents,
both being determined there shall be no such thing as an ignoramus in Denmark, so whether the
children are educated at home or sent to school, they must begin lessons at the age of seven.
If they have a governess at home the parents must give a guarantee to the authorities that
the governess is efficient and capable of giving the standard education to the children. Should
parents elect to take their children abroad during the school term, they must notify their
intention, undertaking that a teacher shall accompany them and lessons continue while away.
Shirking lessons is quite an impossibility for little Danes, as everybody thinks that education
comes before all else, so parents do not encourage idleness or extra holidays during the school
year.

School attendance is compulsory for all children between the ages of seven and fourteen. The
hours are not long nor wearisome, as the lessons are arranged with a view to holding the attention
of young minds during the period of instruction. The classes are small, even in the free schools,
never more than thirty-five pupils to a teacher, and generally less. The lesson lasts forty
minutes, and then there is an interval for play. The thorough education of the pupils for their
future work in life is considered, so lessons in writing, reading, and arithmetic, in the Kommune
schools, are varied by tailoring lessons for boys, and cookery for girls, after they are ten
years of age. At every school gymnastics play an important part--pleasant lessons these are
for all--but perhaps the lesson the boys most delight in is their instruction in Slöyd. Each
lad has his carpenter's bench with necessary tools, and as we know every boy is happy when
making or marring with hammer and nails, I am sure you will think these must be enviable lessons.
I have seen some charming models as well as useful things made by the boys--a perfect miniature
landau, complete in every detail, benches, bureaux, carts, tables, chairs, besides many other
serviceable articles. Besides this pleasure-work at school, the boys, if they are farmers'
sons, have practical lessons at home by helping their father on the farm. The authorities being
anxious to help the farmer, they allow him to keep a boy at home half the day for instruction
in farm-work, but the other half must be spent at school. The prizes at the municipal schools
not infrequently consist of clothes, watches, clocks, or tools, all of which are worked for
eagerly by the pupils.

The boys and girls of Denmark begin early with gymnastic exercises, and soon become sturdy
little athletes from sheer love of the exhilarating practice. All Danes pride themselves--and
with good reason--on their national athletic exercises. At the Olympic Games, held at the Stadium
in London, the Danish ladies carried away the gold medal by their fine gymnastic display. This
was a triumph with so many competitors in the field. It is an amusing sight to see the Danes
at a seaside resort taking their morning swim; each one on leaving the water runs about on
the sun-warmed beach, and goes through a gymnastic display on his own account, choosing the
exercise he considers most calculated to warm and invigorate him after his dip. The children
require no second bidding to follow father's example, and as they emerge from the water breathless,
pantingly join in the fun. Sons try to go one better than the father in some gymnastic feat
which the latter's stoutness renders impossible! The merry peals of laughter which accompany
the display speak eloquently of the thorough enjoyment of all the bathers.

Yachting in Denmark is not merely a pleasure for the rich, it is inexpensive, so all classes
and every man capable of sailing a boat can enjoy it. In the summer-time the Sound and other
waters seem alive with the multitudes of white sails and speeding craft of all sizes. The Øresund
Week, as the Royal Yacht Club's regatta-week is called, is the time of all others for yachtsmen
to display their skill, and a gay event in the Copenhagener's year. The pleasant waters of
Denmark are beloved of yachtsmen. Sailing round the wooded islands, you are impressed by their
picturesque beauty, which is seen to advantage from the water. One is not surprised that this
popular pastime comes first with every Danish boy, who, whether swimming, rowing, or sailing,
feels perfectly at home on the water. Everybody cycles in Denmark. Cycle-stands are provided
outside every shop, station, office, and college, so that you have no more difficulty in disposing
of your cycle than your umbrella.

Football is a summer game here--spirited matches you would think impossible at this season--but
the Danes have them, and what is more, they will inform you that they quite enjoy what appears
to the spectator a hot, fatiguing amusement. Cricket has few attractions for the Danish lads,
but that is because they cannot play, though their schoolmasters and parents would have them
try. All things English are much admired, and when a Dane intends to do a thing he generally
succeeds, so we can only suppose he is too indifferent about cricket--although it is an English
game--to excel.

Golf and hockey are also played, and "bandy"--i.e., hockey on the ice--is a favourite winter
sport. A "bandy" match is quite exciting to watch. The players, armed with a wooden club, often
find the ice a difficulty when rushing after the solid rubber ball. This exhilarating game
is known in some parts of the world as "shinty." The Danes are proficient skaters, and of late
years an artificial ground for winter sport of all kinds has been made in the Ulvedal, near
Copenhagen. Here they have "bandy" matches, ski-ing, and tobogganing, as well as other winter
games. Fox-hunting is unknown in Denmark, but frequently foxes are included in the sportsman's
bag when shooting. These are shot because it is necessary to keep Mr. Reynard's depredations
under control. Trotting-matches are held on Sunday on the racecourse near Charlottenlund, and
horse-racing takes place too. Lawn-tennis and croquet are very popular, but the latter is the
favourite pastime of the Danish ladies.

CHAPTER XV

INGEBORG'S JOURNEY THROUGH SEELAND

Funen, the island which lies between the Great and Little Belts, is known as the "Garden of
Denmark," on account of its beauty and fertility. In Odense, the capital, Ingeborg had lived
happily all the fifteen summers of her life. Now she was to have an unexpected treat. Her grandfather
intended taking her with him on the morrow to see some of the historical places in Seeland.
Ingeborg loved history, and had given her grandfather much pleasure by the knowledge she displayed
when showing him over her own church, St. Knud's. This ancient Gothic Church is the finest
specimen of mediæval architecture in Denmark. St. Knud, the grand-nephew of Canute the Great,
was slain before the altar while praying for his people. This brave King could have saved himself
by flight, but would not, lest his subjects should suffer at the hands of his enemies. He was
canonized by the Pope, and his brother built the church to his memory. Besides being the shrine
of St. Knud, this church is the burial-place of King Christian II. and his Queen, as well as
of King Hans and his Consort. The beautiful altar-piece, given by Queen Christina, is of the
most exquisite workmanship, and took the artists many years to execute.

Ingeborg's excitement was great when she crossed from Nyborg. She remembered that an army once
crossed this water on foot, so severe was the winter, and that ice-breakers are still used
occasionally. The girl wished it was winter as she watched for the first time the huge paddle-wheels
of the steam-ferry ploughing through the waters of the Great Belt. By the time Korsör was reached,
Herr Nielsen, her grandfather, had made acquaintance with a student who was returning to his
college at Sorö, the town which they intended making their first stopping-place. The student,
whose name was Hans, informed them that he lived at Ribe, a quaint old town of South Jutland,
left very much to memories and the storks, but possessing a fine twelfth-century Cathedral.
The college at Sorö was founded by Ludvig Holberg, the father of Danish comedy, who left his
fortune and library for that purpose. Hans was proud of belonging to this college, as it had
educated many men of letters famous in Danish history.

In the Cistercian Church of Sorö, Bishop Absalon, the founder of Copenhagen, lies buried. It
is said that this Bishop's spirit appears, with menacing attitude, if anyone desecrates the
place by irreverence. Ludvig Holberg is also buried in this cloister church, as well as three
Danish Kings.

Ingemann the poet spent most of his time at this charming town, which stands on the lake of
the Sorö Sö. In the luxuriant beech-woods which surround the lake, Saxo Grammaticus, the first
historian of Denmark, was wont to wander. Both these celebrated men also lie in the old church,
which Ingeborg felt was a fitting resting-place for the noble dead.

On the advice of Hans, Herr Nielsen took his young grand-daughter to see the old convent church
of Ringsted. Here many Danish Kings were buried in the twelfth, thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.
The interesting Romanesque Church of Kallundborg was also visited. This Church, with its four
octagonal towers and a square tower in the middle, forms a Greek cross. This is the most unique
specimen of mediæval architecture in the North.

Ingeborg had long looked forward to seeing Roskilde Cathedral, and the day was bright and sunny
when they arrived at the sleepy little town on the Roskilde Fjord. This stately Cathedral,
with its two tall pointed spires, is called the "Westminster Abbey" of Denmark. It is the burial-place
of the Danish Royal Family: thirty-three Kings and many Queens rest in it. A beautiful alabaster
tomb marks the resting-place of Queen Margrethe, the famous Queen who united the three Crowns--Norway,
Sweden, and Denmark--and was ever ambitious for the glory and development of these countries.
She ruled with wisdom and wonderful diplomacy, and was the most powerful Queen Denmark ever
had. She has been called the "Semiramis of the North." Though the three crowns are still on
the shield of Denmark, the other two kingdoms were lost to her in the sixteenth century. Queen
Margrethe was the daughter of Valdemar IV., known as "Atterdag," because of his favourite proverb:
"I Morgen er der atter en Dag."[11] This powerful monarch kept his subjects in such incessant
turmoil by his numerous wars for acquiring territory "that they had not time to eat"! Something on one
golden morning reflecting of my life i was allow to possession his suffering. That others were
remembering the career of Christ, how formerly he must have said: "yes, and i can freely had
the prerogative to deliver his mark for him. The mural paintings of the chapel represent scenes in the life of
this great King.

Ingeborg was glad she remembered her history, and could tell her grandfather so much as they
went through the Cathedral. He, however, informed her that Frederik VII. was the last of the
Kings of the Oldenburg line, which had been on the throne of Denmark for over four hundred years.

The sarcophagus of the beloved Christian IX., father of many European crowned heads, including
Queen Alexandra of England, is still kept covered with fresh flowers. This King, whose memory
is so revered in all countries, inaugurated a new dynasty in Denmark. The curious old clock
at the western end of the cathedral interested Ingeborg, and she watched with delight, when
it struck the hour of noon, St. George, mounted on his fiery steed, with many groans and stiff,
jerky movements, kill the dragon, which expired with a gruesome death-rattle!

In the thirteenth century this quiet town of Roskilde was the capital, and the archiepiscopal
see of Denmark. An English Bishop, William of Roskilde, is supposed to have built the Cathedral.
