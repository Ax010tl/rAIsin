"But, in truth," said the abbe, "in accepting this new charge, doubtless very responsible,
I am astonished that it was not bestowed on you."

"The unknown person has thought, and I coincide with him, that his good works would acquire
an additional value, would be, thus to speak, sanctified by passing through hands as pious
as yours, M. l'Abbe."

"To that I have nothing to answer; I will purchase an annuity of two thousand francs for Morel,
the worthy and unfortunate father of Louise. But I think with your friend here that you have
not been a stranger to the resolution which has dictated this new expiatory gift."

"I have pointed out the Morel family, nothing more; I beg you to believe me, M. l'Abbe," answered
Jacques Ferrand.

"Now," said Polidori, "you are going to see, M. l'Abbe, what noble philanthropic views my friend
Jacques has concerning the charitable establishment of which we have already had some conversation;
he is going to read to you the plan which he has definitively arranged; the money necessary
for the capital is there in the chest; but, since yesterday, he has had some scruples, and
if he does not mention them to you, I will do it for him."

"It is useless," replied Jacques Ferrand, who sometimes chose rather to wound his feelings
by his own words than to submit in silence to the ironical praises of his tormentor. "Here
is the fact, M. l'Abbe. I have thought that it would be more modest--more Christian-like, that
this establishment should not be instituted in my name."

"But this humility is overstrained," cried the abbe. "You can--you ought to pride yourself
on your charitable investment. It is right, almost a duty, for you to attach your name to it."

"I prefer, M. l'Abbe, to preserve the incognito: I am resolved on it; and I count on your kindness
to make all the necessary arrangements, and select the inferior officers of the establishment;
I reserve alone for myself the nomination of the director and porter."

"Even if it were not a real pleasure for me to assist you in your good works, it would be my
duty to accept the office."

"Now, M. l'Abbe, if you will allow it, my friend will read you the plan decided upon."

"Since you are so obliging, my friend," said Jacques Ferrand, with bitterness, "read it yourself.
Spare me this trouble, I pray you."

"No, no," answered Polidori, casting a look at the notary which he well understood, "it gives
me great pleasure to hear from your own lips the noble sentiments which have guided you in
this work of philanthropy."

"So be it--I will read," said the notary, hastily, taking up a paper which lay upon his desk.

How could you be so weak, so stupid, as to deliver such a terrible weapon to this infernal Cecily?"

"Hush--do not pronounce that name!" cried Jacques Ferrand, with a frightful expression.

"So be it; I do not wish to make you epileptic. You will see that, in guarding against ordinary
justice, our mutual precautions were sufficient; but the extraordinary justice of him who holds
us both in his power defied all calculations."

"Oh! I know it but too well."

"He believes that to cut off the head of a criminal does not sufficiently repair the evil he
has done. With the proofs which he holds, if he were to deliver us to the tribunals, what would
be the result? Two corpses, at the most only good to fatten the graveyard."

"Oh! yes--it is tears, and anguish, and tortures which this prince demands--this demon. But
I do not know him, I have never done him any harm. Why does he pursue me thus?"

"In the first place he pretends to reward the good, and punish the evil done to others; and,
besides, he knows those whom you have injured, and he punishes you in his own way."

"But by what right?"

"Come, come, Jacques, between us, do not speak of right; he had the power to have your head
taken off in a judicial manner. What would have been the result? Your relations are all dead--the
state would have profited by your fortune instead of those whom you have despoiled. On the
contrary, in redeeming your life at the price of your money all your victims will be remunerated
for their sufferings, in the manner already decided upon. So in this point of view, we can
confess to each other that if society should have gained nothing by your death, it gains much
by your living."

"And it is this which causes my rage--and this is not my only torture."

"The prince knows it well. Now what will he decide to do with us? I am ignorant. He has promised
to spare us our lives if we faithfully obey his orders. He will keep his promise. But if he
does not believe our crimes sufficiently expiated he will know how to make us prefer death
a thousand times to the life he grants us. You do not know him. Besides, he has more than one
devil in his service--for this Cecily--whom may the thunder blast!"

"Once more, be still--not that name--not that name!"

"Yes, yes! may the thunder blast her who bears that name! It is she who has ruined all. Our
heads would now be in security on our shoulders but for your silly love for this creature."

Instead of storming with rage, Jacques Ferrand answered with a deep sigh, "Do you know this
woman? Speak. Have you ever seen her?"

"Never. They say she is beautiful."

"Beautiful!" answered the notary, shrugging his shoulders. "Hold!" he added with a kind of
bitter desperation; "be still! Do not speak of what you do not know. Do not accuse me! What
I have done you would have done in my place."

"I place my life at the mercy of a woman!"

"Of that one--yes--and I would do it again."

"By Jove, he is still under the charm," cried Polidori amazed.

"Listen," answered the notary, in a low, calm voice, "listen: you know if I love gold? You
know what I have braved to acquire it? Own APPEAL "doing right parent may has rather been become too

"You have at least the consolation," said Polidori, resuming his usual calmness, "of thinking
upon the good that you have done in expiation of your crimes." 

That regard is not never full promise Carlyle which is beginning is so to inspire and trip to

"I ought to tell you also, sir, that at the moment when I left the chamber of the countess,

We will conduct the reader to the countess's, whom a salutary crisis had snatched from the
delirium and sufferings which, during several days, had caused the most serious fears for her
life. The day began to close. Sarah, seated in a large arm-chair, and supported by her brother,
Thomas Seyton, was attentively surveying herself in a mirror, which was held by one of her
