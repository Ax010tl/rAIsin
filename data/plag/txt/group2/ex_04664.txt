Even when the water was thick with mud, this crazy coon persisted in washing his clean cake
and cabbage therein. Indeed, the muddier the water, the more vigorously would he wash. The
habit was a part of him, as real a thing in his constitution as the black ring in his fur.
It was a very dirty habit, here in captivity, even if it went by the name of washing. Of course
Mux could not be blamed for his soiled wash-water. That was my fault; only I couldn't be changing
it every time he soaked up a fistful of earth in his endeavor to wash something to eat out
of it. No; he was not at fault, altogether, for the mud in his tub. Out in the Bear Swamp,
the streams that wandered about under the great high-spreading gums, and lost their way in
the shadows, were crystal-clear and pure; and out there it was intended that he should dwell,
and in those sweet streams that he should wash. But what a modicum of wit, of originality the
little beast had, that, because he was born a washer, wash he must, though he washed in mud,
nay, though he washed upon the upturned bottom of his empty tub!--for this is what Mux did
sometimes.

I never blamed Aunt Milly for insisting upon this rather ill-sounding name of "Mux" for the
little coon. She was standing by his cage, shortly after his arrival, watching him eat cabbage.
He washed every clean white piece of it in his oozy tub before tasting it, coating the bits
over with mud as you do the lumps of fondant with chocolate in making "chocolate creams." "and somewhat,
isn'it probable.

 A few mornings
before this, a boy from a neighboring farm had come to fish here and had found a fisher ahead
of him. He was just about to cast, when back under the limbs of the beeches the water broke,
and a mink rose to the surface with a fine perch twisting in her jaws. Straight toward the
boy she swam till within reach of his rod, when she recognized the human in him, turned a back-dive
somersault, and vanished.

Would she be fishing again this morning? I hoped so. It was her hour--the hour of the rising
mist; visitors rarely found their way to the pool; and I knew the appearance of the boy had
given her no lasting alarm.

Floating around the bend, I pulled in among the shore bushes by a bit of grape-vine, and sitting
down upon it, made my boat fast. I had planned the trip with the hope of seeing this mink;
so I waited, quite hidden, though having the pool in full view. An hour passed, but no mink
appeared. Another hour, and the sun was breaking upon the beeches, and the mist was gone; yet
no mink came to fish. And what mink would? Of course you must have it in mind to see a mink
fish if you wish to see anything; but the day you really catch the mink fishing will likely
be the day you went out to watch for muskrats.

So an hour's waiting is rarely fruitless. The mink did not come, but another and quite as expert
a fisher did. All the way up the creek I had been hearing the throaty ghouw-bhouw of a great
blue heron off in the swamp. It was he that came for perch.

The flapping of the great blue heron is a sight good for the soul--an unheard-of motion these
days, so moderate, unhurried, and time-contemning! The wing-beats of this one, as he came dangling
down upon the meadow opposite me, have often given me pause since. If I could have the wings
of the great blue heron and flap to my fishing now and again!

On alighting, however, he was instantly all nerve and tension. With the utmost caution he came
over the high sedges on his stilt-like legs to the brink of the creek and posed. I doubt if
a frog or a minnow could have told he was a thing of life. Stiff as a stub, every muscle taut,
all alert, he stood, till--flash! and the long pointed bill pinned a perch, a foot and a half
beneath the water. He had quite made out a breakfast, when, stepping upon a tall tussock, he
stood face to face with me--a human spectator! It was only for a moment that I could keep motionless
enough to puzzle him. Some muscle must have twitched, for he understood and leaped into the
air with a croak of mortal fright.

II

The creek was roped off by the sagging fox grape-vines, and barred, from this point on, by
the alders, so that I gave up all attempt at farther ascent. I had already given up the mink;
yet I waited under the beeches.

It was blazing overhead, growing hotter and closer all the time, with hardly breeze enough
to disturb the sleep of the leaf shadows on the sleepy stream. A rusty, red-bellied water-snake,
in a mat of briers near by, relaxed and straightened slowly out,--and softly, that I might
not be attracted,--stretching himself to the warmth. I could have broken his back with my paddle,
and perhaps, by so doing, saved the nestlings of a pair of Maryland yellowthroats fidgeting
about near him. He had eaten many a young bird of these bushes, I was sure--yet only circumstantially
sure. Catching him in the act of robbing a nest would have been different; I should have felt
justified then in despatching him. But to strike him asleep in the sun simply because he was
a snake would have robbed the spot of part of its life and spirit and robbed me of serenity
for the rest of the day. I should not have been, able to enjoy the quiet again until I had
said my prayers and slept.

And as between the hawks and other wild birds, we need not interfere. While the water-snake
was spreading himself, a small hawk, a sharp-shinned, I think, came beating over the meadow
and was met by a vigilance committee of red-shouldered blackbirds. He did not stop to eat any
of them, but darted up, and they after him. On up he went, round and round in a rapid, mounting
spiral, till only one of the daring redwings followed. I watched. Up they went, higher than
I had ever seen a blackbird venture before. And against such unequal odds! But the hawk was
scared and had not stopped to look back. He circled; the blackbird cut across inside and caught
him on almost every round. And still higher in pure bravado the redwing forced him. I began
to tremble for the plucky bird, when I saw him turn, half fold his shining wings, and shoot
straight down--a meteor of jet with fire flying from its opposite sides--down, down, while
I held my breath. Suddenly the wings flashed, and he was scaling a steep incline; another flash,
a turn, and he was upon a slower plane--had thrown himself against the air and settled upon
the swaying top of a brown cattail.

A quiet had been creeping over the swamp and meadow. The dry rasp of a dragon-fly's wings was

Because I turned from all this sunset glory to find out what little bird was making the very
big fuss near by, and because, parting the foliage of an arrow-wood bush, I looked with exquisite
pleasure into the nest of a white-eyed vireo, does it mean that I am still unborn as to soul?
For some reason it was a relief to look away from that west of vast and burning color to the
delicately dotted eggs in the tiny cradle--the same relief felt in descending from a mountain-top
to the valley; in turning from the sweep of the sea to watch beach-fleas hopping over the sand;
in giving over the wisdom of men for the gabble of my little boys.

How the vireo scolded! and her mate! He half sang his threat and defiance. "Come, get out of
this! Come; do you hear?" he cried over and over, as I peeked into the nest. These were specially compilations spirit

 A few sticks had been laid upon the ends of the bending rose-bushes,
and this flimsy, inadequate platform was literally covered by the five dirty-white eggs. The
hen had to stand on the bushes straddling the nest in order to brood. How she ever got as close
to the nest as that without spilling its contents was hard to see; for I took an egg out and
had the greatest difficulty in putting it back, so little room was there, so near to nothing
for it to rest upon.

Working back into the channel, I gave the skiff to the easy current and drew slowly along toward

 I was wading the sunken trail, much as one
"treads water," my head not always above the surface of the fronds, when, suddenly, close to
my side the ferns in a single spot were violently shaken. Instantly ahead of me they whirled
again' and before I could think, off across the path was another rush and whirl--then stirless
silence.

I knew what it meant. These were not the sudden, startled leaps of three animals, but the lightning
movements of one. I had crossed the path of a swamp black-snake, and judging from the speed
and whirl, it was a snake of uncommon size.

The path, a few paces farther on, opened into a small patch of low grass. Just as I was getting
through the brake to this spot I stopped short with a chill. In the ferns near me shrilled
a hissing whistle, a weird, creepy whistle that made me cold--a fierce, menacing sound, all
edge, and so thin that it slivered every nerve in me. And then, without a stir in the brake,
up out of the low grass in front of me rose a blue-black, glittering head.

I have little faith in the spell of a snake's eye, yet for a moment I was held by the subtle,
masterful face that had risen so unexpectedly, so coolly before me. But its respect, cut is an I.

The curved neck straightened at that, the glinting head swayed forward, and shivering through
me as the swish of a stick never shivered through a snake, sounded that unearthly hissing whistle.
For a second--for just the fraction of a second that it takes to jump--I was, not scared, but
shocked; and I slipped on something underfoot. In three directions I wallowed the ferns before
I got to my feet to watch the snake again, and by that time the snake was gone.

I found myself somewhat muddy and breathing a little hard; but I was not wholly chagrined. Me
