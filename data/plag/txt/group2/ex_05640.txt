by rest of any altogether be lay, sensual Spirit.

 However, they found soon after
either logs or old canoes, so that they were able to come along with us.

It was my misfortune to have a canoe which was very heavy and consequently sluggish. Because
of this we were left behind the rest a little way, there being only four men beside myself
in the boat. As the tide fell it left several shoals of sand naked, and hence we, not knowing
the location of the channel amongst such a variety of streams, steered for over two miles into
a shoal where we were forced to lie by until high water came. As soon as the tide began to
turn, we rowed away, but in spite of all our endeavors, we could neither find nor overtake
our companions. At ten o'clock, when the tide became low, we stuck an oar in the sands and
by turns slept in our canoe, where we were pierced to the skin by the showers that fell in
the night.

The next morning, as soon as the day had come, we rowed away down the river in pursuit of our
people, and after going about two leagues we were so fortunate as to overtake them at an Indian
landing place, where they had been taking in water. They told us that we would not find water
again for six days, and that we must without fail fill our jars. Although we made what haste
we could, by the time our jars were filled our friends had all departed and were already out
of sight. Such is the nature of the pirates; they care not in the least whom they lose or leave
behind.

We rowed after them as fast as we possibly could, but all in vain, for here in the mouth of
the river the islands were so numerous that it was very easy for us to lose them a second time.
After much trouble and toil we did at last find the mouth of the river, but here the tide was
again coming in, so that though we were within a stone's throw from the mouth of the river,
we could not go through it, but were forced to put ashore and wait for better water. Accordingly
we hauled our canoe close by the bushes and fastened it to a tree which the tide had almost
covered.

As soon as the tide began to turn, we rowed away again, crossing the Gulf of Miguel. Here we
had a very hard time fighting the waves, which dashed against our canoe and might easily have
filled and overwhelmed it, for the boat was nearly twenty feet long and not over one and a
half broad where it was widest. At dark we landed on an island where we had the most sorrowful
resting place I ever experienced in my whole life. It rained impetuously all night long, in
so much that we were wet from head to foot and had not one dry thread about us; and so violent
was the rain that we could not keep any fire going to warm or dry ourselves. Not one minute's
sleep did we get during the whole night, and our plight was indeed an awful one, remote from
our companions and wholly destitute of all human comfort. As morning broke, our plight was
little relieved, for a vast sea surrounded us on one side, and on the other we could see nothing
but high mountains and rocks. Our boat was but an eggshell, and we had few clothes to defend
us from the weather. In fact, not one of us at that time had a shoe to his foot.

Wet and cold as we were, however, we put forth to sea and rowed away, passing several islands.
In the open sea the smallness of our vessel put us again in deadly peril, and it always required
one man and sometimes two to bail out the water that came over the sides of the boat. When
we had struggled for some time with these difficulties, and when we were near one of the smaller
islands, a huge wave overturned our boat and we were all forced to swim for our lives, but
did manage to get to shore, where soon our canoe was thrown after us. All our bread and fresh
water were spoiled, but as our guns were lashed to the boat and were kept in waxed cases, we
lost none of them. Our first business was to take them out and clean them.

Scarcely had this been done when we saw another boat suffering from the same misfortune at
a little distance from us. The persons thus cast ashore proved to be six Spaniards from the
garrison at Santa Maria who had followed us to escape the Indians. Presently they joined us,
and we built a fire, broiled our meat on the coals, and all ate amicably together. We were
suffering terribly for water, as we had none to drink and knew not where to get any. Fortunately
our canoe was thrown on edge and very little injured, but the one on which the Spaniards came
split itself against the rocks, being old and slender, and was broken into a hundred pieces.

My company was now much discouraged and wished to return, but after much persuasion I induced
them to go forward at least one day longer, saying I would then be willing to do whatever they
saw fit. About the time they concluded to follow me, our watchman espied an Indian, who as
soon as he knew he had been seen, ran hastily to the woods. Immediately I sent two of my companions
after him. Finding he was one of our friendly Indians, they followed him along the shore to
where seven more of his companions with a great canoe were resting on the seashore. By means
of signs I asked him what had become of my companions, and the Indians assured us that if we
would take their boat instead of our own, we would overtake our friends before morning.

We were rejoicing over this news when the Indians noticed that six of the men of our company
did not seem to be of the same language and kind as ourselves. We told them they were Wankers,
which is the name the Indians commonly give to the Spaniards. Their next question was, "May
we kill those Spaniards?" I answered them, "By no means; I will not consent to have it done."
To this the Indians seemed to consent, but after a little while, when my back was turned, some
of my company, thinking to oblige the Indians, beckoned to them to kill the Spaniards. Perceiving
their danger, the Spaniards made a great outcry, which I heard, and I turned around in time
to save their lives. Although I was able to accomplish this, I could not prevent them, however,
from taking one of the Spaniards as a slave. To the others, however, I gave the canoe in which
I came and bade them to get away as speedily as possible in order to save their lives from
the Indians.

Then joining company with the Indians we entered a very large canoe, which was able to carry
at least twenty men more easily than our canoe could carry five. Moreover the Indians had also
fitted a good sail to the canoe, so that, having a fresh breeze, we set sail and moved rapidly
away, to the infinite joy and comfort of our hearts. In one place we ran into a heavy sea,
which was caused by a strong current and the heavy winds, and many times our boat was filled
with spray. Again at night it rained heavily for several hours and was very dark.

About nine o'clock we discovered two fires on the shore of the mainland. The Indians began
to shout and to cry out joyously that these fires were made by their companions. Accordingly
we made for the shore as fast as we could drive, but as soon as we had reached it about sixty
Spaniards, armed with clubs and other arms, rushed out into the breakers, laid hold of our
canoe on both sides and pulled it out of the water. Thus were we all taken and made prisoners.
I laid hold of my gun, thinking to defend myself, but it was all in vain, for four or five
of them stopped and overpowered me. The Indians leaped overboard and got away very nimbly into
the woods, though my companions were too much amazed to make any attempt to escape.

Our captors could speak neither French nor English, but I was able to talk, in Latin, with
one of them who seemed more intelligent than the rest, and from him I learned that these were
Spaniards who had been put ashore by our other boats for fear that some of them might escape
and warn Panama that we were on our way to capture it. The should i do because that flesh, and all

 Thus we got to the windward of the enemy as our other canoes
had already done. At this moment the Admiral of the Little Fleet came up with us suddenly,
scarcely giving us time to charge, and thinking to pass by us with as little damage as the
first of his ships had received, or even less. But it fell out much worse for him, for we were
so fortunate as to kill the man at the helm, so that his ship ran into the wind and her sails
lay "a-back" as the mariners say. This gave us time to come up under the stern of his vessel,
and firing continually into the vessel we killed as many as came to the helm, and cut in two
his mainsail and brace.

At this time the third Spanish vessel was seen coming up to the aid of the Admiral's ship.
Captain Sawkins left the latter to our four canoes and rowed away to meet the oncoming Spaniards.
The dispute or fight between them was very hot, as they lay close together, and fought from
one side of the deck to the other, both giving and receiving death as fast as they could charge.
Meanwhile the first ship tacked about and came up to relieve the Admiral. We determined to
prevent this design, and two of our canoes, Captain Springer's and my own, stood out to meet
the new arrival, who made direct upon the Admiral, who stood upon the quarter-deck waving at
him with a handkerchief what to do. But we met him in the middle of his way, and came so close
to him that if he had not turned his course, we should have been on board him. As it was, we
killed so many of his crew that the vessel had scarcely men enough left alive and unwounded
to carry her off. Fortunately for them, the wind sprang up fresh, and they were able to sail
away and save their lives.

Having put to flight the vessel which was to relieve the Admiral, we turned about and with
a loud halloo joined our friends in the other boat, and came so close under the stern of the
Admiral's ship that we wedged up the rudder and at the same time killed both the Admiral and
the chief pilot. Seeing how disabled their ship was, and disheartened by the slaughter, for
at least two-thirds of their men had been killed and many others wounded, they cried for quarter,
which had several times been offered them, but had been always stoutly denied. So we took possession
of the Admiral's ship and put on board all our wounded men, including Captain Harris, who had
been shot through both his legs. As soon as this was done, we instantly sent some of our ships
to go and aid Captain Sawkins, who had been fighting against the second Spanish ship. Indeed,
to give our enemies their due, no men in the world ever fought more bravely than these same
Spaniards.

Coming up close under the Spaniard's side, we gave him a full volley of shot and expected to
have a like return from him, but of a sudden we saw his men that were abaft the mast, blown
up in the air, some of them falling into the deck and others into the sea. This disaster was
no sooner seen by their valiant Captain than he leaped overboard, and in spite of all our shot
succeeded in rescuing some of his men, although he was much burned in both his hands himself.
But while he was rescuing these men to reinforce the ship and renew the fight, another jar
of powder took fire and blew up several others upon the forecastle.

Under cover of the smoke from these explosions. Captain Sawkins led his men on board and took
the ship. Soon after I went on board myself, and indeed, such a miserable sight I never saw
in my life. For not one man was to be found but was either killed, desperately wounded or horribly
burned with powder, in so much that their black skins were turned white in several places where
the powder had torn it from their flesh and bones.

Having compassionated their misery, I afterwards went on board the Admiral's ship, and here
what I saw did much astonish me, and would scarcely be believed by others than ourselves who
saw it. There were found on this ship only twenty-five men alive, where before the fight there
were four-score and six. And out of these twenty-five men, only eight were able to bear arms,
all the rest being desperately wounded, and by their wounds totally unable to make any resistance. It
is believed that many wounds were worked to century; and the grave has been opened of excavate
which buried up bones and war to his ornaments once belonging in Kent
Celtic salt-miners for the third and fourth centuries. Peralta, the heroic captain of the
second vessel, tried to dissuade Sawkins from attacking the Spanish vessels at anchor, saying
in the biggest one alone there were three hundred and fifty men, and that all the other vessels
would be found too well provided for defense against the small number of the buccaneers. One
of the Spaniards, however, who lay dying on the deck, told Captain Sawkins that there was not
a single man on board any one of the great ships in the harbor, for they had all been drawn
away to fight on the ships of the Little Fleet. Believing the dying man's story, we sailed
into the harbor and went on board the ships, finding, as we had been told, not one person there.
They had set on fire the biggest ship and made a hole in her hull, but we put out the flames
and stopped the leak. All our wounded were then placed on this ship, which for a time became
our hospital.

Having counted up our own loss and damages, we found eighteen of our men killed and twenty-two
wounded.

The three captains against whom we fought were esteemed by the Spaniards as the bravest in
the South Seas, nor was this reputation undeserved by them, as may easily be seen from the
story of this bloody battle. We began the fight about a half hour after sunrise, and by noon
had finished the battle. While Captain Peralta was our prisoner, he would often break out and
say: "Surely you Englishmen are the valiantest in the whole world, and always design to fight
in the open; while all other nations have invented all kinds of ways to barricade themselves
and fight as close as possible"; and yet notwithstanding, we killed more of the enemy than
they have of us.

The buccaneers captured the five ships that lay near the Island of Perico and divided the spoils
among themselves. Within the next two or three days, however, dissensions arose among them,
and Captain Coxon, taking with him a large number of men together with most of the Indian allies,
deserted the expedition and returned. During this time Captain Sharp was absent, and after
the departure of Coxon, Captain Sawkins was chosen to command. For some weeks the buccaneers
remained in the Bay of Panama, capturing vessels and ravaging the adjacent islands.
