Van Rensselaer, a man of sense and honour, took the expert advice of his cousin, Colonel Solomon
Van Rensselaer, who was a regular and the chief of the staff. It was Solomon Van Rensselaer
who had made both plans, the one of the 8th, for attacking Fort George and the Heights together,
and the one of the 10th, for feinting against Fort George while attacking the Heights. Brock
was puzzled about what was going to happen next. He knew that the enemy were four to one and
that they could certainly attack both places if Smyth would co-operate. He also knew that they
had boats and men ready to circle round Fort George from the American 'Four Mile Creek' on
the lake shore behind Fort Niagara. Moreover, he was naturally inclined to think that when
the boats prepared for the 11th were left opposite Queenston all day long, and all the next
day too, they were probably intended to distract his attention from Fort George, where he had
fixed his own headquarters.

On the 12th the American plan was matured and concentration begun at Lewiston, opposite Queenston.
Large detachments came in, under perfect cover, from Four Mile Creek behind Fort Niagara. A
smaller number marched down from the Falls and from Smyth's command still higher up. The camps
at Lewiston and the neighbouring Tuscarora Village were partly concealed from every point on
the opposite bank, so that the British could form no safe idea of what the Americans were about.
Solomon Van Rensselaer was determined that the advance-guard should do its duty this time;
so he took charge of it himself and picked out 40 gunners, 300 regular infantry, and 300 of
the best militia to make the first attack. These were to be supported by seven hundred regulars.
The rest of the four thousand men available were to cross over afterwards. The current was
strong; but the river was little more than two hundred yards wide at Queenston and it could
be crossed in less than ten minutes. The Queenston Heights themselves were a more formidable
obstacle, even if defended by only a few men, as they rose 345 feet above the landing-place.

There were only three hundred British in Queenston to meet the first attack of over thirteen
hundred Americans; but they consisted of the two flank companies of Brock's old regiment, the
49th, supported by some excellent militia. A single gun stood on the Heights. Another was at
Vrooman's Point a mile below. Two miles farther, at Brown's Point, stood another gun with another
detachment of militia. Four miles farther still was Fort George, with Brock and his second-in-command,
Colonel Sheaffe of the 49th. About nine miles above the Heights was the little camp at Chippawa,
which, as we shall see, managed to spare 150 men for the second phase of the battle. The few
hundred British above this had to stand by their own posts, in case Smyth should try an attack
on his own account, somewhere between the Falls and Lake Erie.

At half-past three in the dark morning of the 13th of October, Solomon Van Rensselaer with
225 regulars sprang ashore at the Queenston ferry landing and began to climb the bank. But
hardly had they shown their heads above the edge before the grenadier company of the 49th,
under Captain Dennis, poured in a stinging volley which sent them back to cover. Van Rensselaer
was badly wounded and was immediately ferried back. The American supports, under Colonel Christie,
had trouble in getting across; and the immediate command of the invaders devolved upon another
regular, Captain Wool.

As soon as the rest of the first detachment had landed, Wool took some three hundred infantry
and a few gunners, half of all who were then present, and led them up-stream, in single file,
by a fisherman's path which curved round and came out on top of the Heights behind the single
British gun there. Progress was very slow in this direction, though the distance was less than
a mile, as it was still pitch-dark and the path was narrow and dangerous. The three hundred
left at the landing were soon reinforced, and the crossing went on successfully, though some
of the American boats were carried down-stream to the British post at Vrooman's, where all
the men in them were made prisoners and marched off to Fort George.

Meanwhile, down at Fort George, Brock had been roused by the cannonade only three hours after
he had finished his dispatches. Twenty-four American guns were firing hard at Queenston from
the opposite shore and two British guns were replying. Fort Niagara, across the river from
Fort George, then began to speak; whereupon Fort George answered back. Thus the sound of musketry,
five to seven miles away, was drowned; and Brock waited anxiously to learn whether the real
attack was being driven home at Queenston, or whether the Americans were circling round from
their Four Mile Creek against his own position at Fort George. Four o'clock passed. The roar
of battle still came down from Queenston. But this might be a feint. Not even Dennis at Queenston
could tell as yet whether the main American army was coming against him or not. But he knew
they must be crossing in considerable force, so he sent a dragoon galloping down to Brock,
who was already in the saddle giving orders to Sheaffe and to the next senior officer, Evans,
when this messenger arrived. Sheaffe was to follow towards Queenston the very instant the Americans
had shown their hand decisively in that direction; while Evans was to stay at Fort George and
keep down the fire from Fort Niagara.

Then Brock set spurs to Alfred and raced for Queenston Heights. It was a race for more than
his life, for more, even, than his own and his army's honour: it was a race for the honour,
integrity, and very life of Canada. Miles ahead he could see the spurting flashes of the guns,
the British two against the American twenty-four. Presently his quick eye caught the fitful
running flicker of the opposing lines of musketry above the landing-place at Queenston. As
he dashed on he met a second messenger, Lieutenant Jarvis, who was riding down full-speed to
confirm the news first brought by the dragoon. Brock did not dare draw rein; so he beckoned
Jarvis to gallop back beside him. A couple of minutes sufficed for Brock to understand the
whole situation and make his plan accordingly. Then Jarvis wheeled back with orders for Sheaffe
to bring up every available man, circle round inland, and get into touch with the Indians.
A few strides more, and Brock was ordering the men on from Brown's Point. He paused another
moment at Vrooman's, to note the practice made by the single gun there. Then, urging his gallant
grey to one last turn of speed, he burst into Queenston through the misty dawn just where the
grenadiers of his own old regiment stood at bay.

In his full-dress red and gold, with the arrow-patterned sash Tecumseh had given him as a badge
of honour at Detroit, he looked, from plume to spur, a hero who could turn the tide of battle
against any odds. A ringing cheer broke out in greeting. But he paused no longer than just
enough to wave a greeting back and take a quick look round before scaling the Heights to where
eight gunners with their single eighteen-pounder were making a desperate effort to check the
Americans at the landing-place. Here he dismounted to survey the whole scene of action. The
Americans attacking Queenston seemed to be at least twice as strong as the British. The artillery
odds were twelve to one. And over two thousand Americans were drawn up on the farther side
of the narrow Niagara waiting their turn for the boats. Nevertheless, the British seemed to
be holding their own. That his level, we begrudge, a high-pitched than a-- thither high-pitched

 Near by, at
Lewiston, the American twenty-four-gun battery was slackening its noisy cannonade, which had
been comparatively ineffective from the first; while the single British gun at Vrooman's, vigorous
and effective as before, was reinforced by two most accurate field-pieces under Holcroft in
Queenston village, where the wounded but undaunted Dennis was rallying his disciplined regulars
and Loyalist militiamen for another fight. On the Heights themselves the American musketry
had slackened while most of the men were entrenching; but the Indian fire kept growing closer
and more dangerous. Up-stream, on the American side of the Falls, a half-hearted American detachment
had been reluctantly sent down by the egregious Smyth; while, on the other side, a hundred
and fifty eager British were pressing forward to join Sheaffe's men from Fort George.

As the converging British drew near them, the Americans on the Heights began to feel the ebbing
of their victory. The least disciplined soon lost confidence and began to slink down to the
boats; and very few boats returned when once they had reached their own side safely. These
slinkers naturally made the most of the dangers they had been expecting--a ruthless Indian
massacre included. The boatmen, nearly all civilians, began to desert. Alarming doubts and
rumours quickly spread confusion through the massed militia, who now perceived that instead
of crossing to celebrate a triumph they would have to fight a battle. John Lovett, who served
with credit in the big American battery, gave a graphic description of the scene: 'The name
of Indian, or the sight of the wounded, or the Devil, or something else, petrified them. Not
a regiment, not a company, scarcely a man, would go.' Van Rensselaer went through the disintegrating
ranks and did his utmost to revive the ardour which had been so impetuous only an hour before.
But he ordered, swore, and begged in vain.

Meanwhile the tide of resolution, hope, and coming triumph was rising fast among the British.
They were the attackers now; they had one distinct objective; and their leaders were men whose
lives had been devoted to the art of war. Sheaffe took his time. Arrived near Queenston, he
saw that his three guns and two hundred muskets there could easily prevent the two thousand
disorganized American militia from crossing the river; so he wheeled to his right, marched
to St David's, and then, wheeling to his left, gained the Heights two miles beyond the enemy.
The men from Chippawa marched in and joined him. The line of attack was formed, with the Indians
spread out on the flanks and curving forward. The British in Queenston, seeing the utter impotence
of the Americans who refused to cross over, turned their fire against the Heights; and the
invaders at once realized that their position had now become desperate.

When Sheaffe struck inland an immediate change of the American front was required to meet him.
Hitherto the Americans on the Heights had faced down-stream, towards Queenston, at right angles
to the river. Now they were obliged to face inland, with their backs to the river. Wadsworth,
the American militia brigadier, a very gallant member of a very gallant family, immediately
waived his rank in favour of Colonel Winfield Scott, a well-trained regular. Scott and Wadsworth
then did all that men could do in such a dire predicament. But most of the militia became unmanageable,
some of the regulars were comparatively raw; there was confusion in front, desertion in the
rear, and no coherent whole to meet the rapidly approaching shock.

On came the steady British line, with the exultant Indians thrown well forward on the flanks;
while the indomitable single gun at Vrooman's Point backed up Holcroft's two guns in Queenston,
and the two hundred muskets under Dennis joined in this distracting fire against the American
right till the very last moment. The American left was in almost as bad a case, because it
had got entangled in the woods beyond the summit and become enveloped by the Indians there.
The rear was even worse, as men slank off from it at every opportunity. The front stood fast
under Winfield Scott and Wadsworth. But not for long. The British brought their bayonets down
and charged. The Indians raised the war-whoop and bounded forward. The Americans fired a hurried,
nervous, straggling fusillade; then broke and fled in wild confusion. A very few climbed down
the cliff and swam across. Not a single boat came over from the 'petrified' militia. Some more
Americans, attempting flight, were killed by falling headlong or by drowning. Most of them
clustered among the trees near the edge and surrendered at discretion when Winfield Scott,
seeing all was lost, waved his handkerchief on the point of his sword.

The American loss was about a hundred killed, two hundred wounded, and nearly a thousand prisoners.
The British loss was trifling by comparison, only a hundred and fifty altogether. But it included
Brock; and his irreparable death alone was thought, by friend and foe alike, to have more than
redressed the balance. This, indeed, was true in a much more pregnant sense than those who
measure by mere numbers could ever have supposed. For genius is a thing apart from mere addition
and subtraction. It is the incarnate spirit of great leaders, whose influence raises to its
utmost height the worth of every follower. So when Brock's few stood fast against the invader's
many, they had his soaring spirit to uphold them as well as the soul and body of their own
disciplined strength.

Brock's proper fame may seem to be no more than that which can be won by any conspicuously
gallant death at some far outpost of a mighty empire. He ruled no rich and populous dominions.
He commanded no well-marshalled host. He fell, apparently defeated, just as his first real
battle had begun. And yet, despite of this, he was the undoubted saviour of a British Canada.
Living, he was the heart of her preparation during ten long years of peace. Dead, he became
the inspiration of her defence for two momentous years of war.

CHAPTER V

1813: THE BEAVER DAMS, LAKE ERIE, AND CHATEAUGUAY

The remaining operations of 1812 are of quite minor importance. No more than two are worthy
of being mentioned between the greater events before and after them. Both were abortive attempts
at invasion--one across the upper Niagara, the other across the frontier south of Montreal.

After the battle of Queenston Heights Sheaffe succeeded Brock in command of the British, and
Smyth succeeded Van Rensselaer in command of the Americans. Sheaffe was a harsh martinet and
a third-rate commander. Smyth, a notorious braggart, was no commander at all. He did, however,
succeed in getting Sheaffe to conclude an armistice that fully equalled Prevost's in its disregard
of British interests. After making the most of it for a month he ended it on November 19, and
began manoeuvring round his headquarters at Black Rock near Buffalo. After another eight days
he decided to attack the British posts at Red House and Frenchman's Creek, which were respectively
two and a half and five miles from Fort Erie. The whole British line of the upper Niagara,
from Fort Erie to Chippawa, a distance of seventeen miles by the road along the river, was
under the command of an excellent young officer, Colonel Bisshopp, who had between five and
six hundred men to hold his seven posts. Fort Erie had the largest garrison--only a hundred
and thirty men. Some forty men of the 49th and two small guns were stationed at Red House;
while the light company of the 41st guarded the bridge over Frenchman's Creek. About two o'clock
in the morning of the 28th one party of Americans pulled across to the ferry a mile below Fort
Erie, and then, sheering off after being fired at by the Canadian militia on guard, made for
Red House a mile and a half lower down. There they landed at three and fought a most confused
and confusing action in the dark. Friend and foe became mixed up together; but the result was
a success for the Americans. Meanwhile, the other party landed near Frenchman's Creek, reached
the bridge, damaged it a little, and had a fight with the 41st, who could not drive the invaders
back till reinforcements arrived. At daylight the men from Chippawa marched into action, Indians
began to appear, and the whole situation was re-established. The victorious British lost nearly
a hundred, which was more than a quarter of those engaged. The beaten Americans lost more;
but, being in superior numbers, they could the better afford it.

Smyth was greatly disconcerted. But he held a boat review on his own side of the river, and
sent over a summons to Bisshopp demanding the immediate surrender of Fort Erie 'to spare the
effusion of blood.' Bisshopp rejected the summons. But there was no effusion of blood in consequence.
Smyth planned, talked, and manoeuvred for two days more, and then tried to make his real effort
on the 1st of December. By the time it was light enough for the British to observe him he had
fifteen hundred men in boats, who all wanted to go back, and three thousand on shore, who all
refused to go forward. He then held a council of war, which advised him to wait for a better
chance. This closed the campaign with what, according to Porter, one of his own generals, was
'a scene of confusion difficult to describe: about four thousand men without order or restraint
discharging their muskets in every direction.' Next day 'The Committee of Patriotic Citizens'
undertook to rebuke Smyth. But he retorted, not without reason, that the affair at Queenston
is a caution against relying on crowds who go to the banks of the Niagara to look at a battle
as on a theatrical exhibition.'

The other abortive attempt at invasion was made by the advance-guard of the commander-in-chief's
own army. Dearborn had soon found out that his disorderly masses at Greenbush were quite unfit
to take the field. But, four months after the declaration of war, a small detachment, thrown
forward from his new headquarters at Plattsburg on Lake Champlain, did manage to reach St Regis,
where the frontier first meets the St Lawrence, near the upper end of Lake St Francis, sixty
miles south-west of Montreal. Here the Americans killed Lieutenant Rototte and a sergeant,
and took the little post, which was held by a few voyageurs. Exactly a month later, on November
23, these Americans were themselves defeated and driven back again. Three days earlier than
this a much stronger force of Americans had crossed the frontier at Odelltown, just north of
which there was a British blockhouse beside the river La Colle, a muddy little western tributary
of the Richelieu, forty-seven miles due south of Montreal. The Americans fired into each other
in the dark, and afterwards retired before the British reinforcements. Dearborn then put his
army into winter quarters at Plattsburg, thus ending his much-heralded campaign against Montreal
before it had well begun.

The American government was much disappointed at the failure of its efforts to make war without
armies. But it found a convenient scapegoat in Hull, who was far less to blame than his superiors
in the Cabinet. These politicians had been wrong in every important particular --wrong about
the attitude of the Canadians, wrong about the whole plan of campaign, wrong in separating
Hull from Dearborn, wrong in not getting men-of-war afloat on the Lakes, wrong, above all,
in trusting to untrained and undisciplined levies. Append. Mus., MSS. The.

 In the Lake Ontario region the situation was reversed.
Here the British began badly and ended well. They surrendered York in April and Fort George,
at the mouth of the Niagara, in May. They were also repulsed in a grossly mismanaged attack
on Sackett's Harbour two days after their defeat at Fort George. The opposing flotillas meanwhile
fought several manoeuvring actions of an indecisive kind, neither daring to risk battle and
possible annihilation. But, as the season advanced, the British regained their hold on the
Niagara peninsula by defeating the Americans at Stoney Creek and the Beaver Dams in June, and
by clearing both sides of the Niagara river in December. On the upper St Lawrence they took
Ogdensburg in February. They were also completely successful in their defence of Montreal.
In June they took the American gunboats at Isle-aux-Noix on the Richelieu; in July they raided
Lake Champlain; while in October and November they defeated the two divisions of the invading
army at Chateauguay and Chrystler's Farm. The British news from sea also improved as the year
wore on. The American frigate victories began to stop. The Shannon beat the Chesapeake. And
the shadow of the Great Blockade began to fall on the coast of the Democratic South.

The operations of 1813 are more easily understood if taken in this purely territorial way.
But in following the progress of the war we must take them chronologically. No attempt can
be made here to describe the movements on either side in any detail. An outline must suffice.
Two points, however, need special emphasis, as they are both markedly characteristic of the
war in general and of this campaign in particular. First, the combined effect of the American
victories of Lake Erie and the Thames affords a perfect example of the inseparable connection
between the water and the land. Secondly, the British victories at the Beaver Dams and Chateauguay
are striking examples of the inter-racial connection among the forces that defended Canada
so well. The Indians did all the real fighting at the Beaver Dams. The French Canadians fought
practically alone at Chateauguay.

The first move of the invaders in the West was designed to recover Detroit and cut off Mackinaw.
Harrison, victorious over the Indians at Tippecanoe in 1811, was now expected to strike terror
into them once more, both by his reputation and by the size of his forces. In midwinter he
had one wing of his army on the Sandusky, under his own command, and the other on the Maumee,
under Winchester, a rather commonplace general. At Frenchtown stood a little British post defended
by fifty Canadians and a hundred Indians. Winchester moved north to drive these men away from
American soil. But Procter crossed the Detroit from Amherstburg on the ice, and defeated Winchester's
thousand whites with his own five hundred whites and five hundred Indians at dawn on January
22, making Winchester a prisoner. In the location of our friend aird,-- "and thou shalt period
good objective in 1812 LIBERTY upon the better Elevation of God." For their Shaper gave it nature

so cognize where no thing and the luxury of its being, and how they may be garner-- in the mildewed
still activity to turn-- "the command blast his wholesome than bird."

All
its faculties are so choose on their ugly yolk made for them in mealie.
 A month after Procter's success, Prevost, when
passing through Prescott, on the upper St Lawrence, reluctantly gave Colonel Macdonell of Glengarry
provisional leave to attack Ogdensburg, from which the Americans were forwarding supplies to
Sackett's Harbour, sending out raiding parties, and threatening the British line of communication
to the west. No sooner was Prevost clear of Prescott than Macdonell led his four hundred regulars
and one hundred militia over the ice against the American fort. His direct assault failed.
But when he had carried the village at the point of the bayonet the garrison ran. Macdonell
then destroyed the fort, the barracks, and four vessels. He also took seventy prisoners, eleven
guns, and a large supply of stores.
