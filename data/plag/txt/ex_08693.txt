In the morning the Emperor called me, and said, "I have decided to dance this evening at the
house of the ambassador of Italy; you will carry, during the day, ten complete costumes to
the apartments he has prepared for me."  I obeyed, and in the evening accompanied his Majesty
to the residence of M. Marescalchi, and dressed him as best I could in a black domino, taking
great pains to render him unrecognizable; and everything went well, in spite of numerous observations
on the Emperor's part as to the absurdity of a disguise, the bad appearance a domino makes,
etc. But, when it was proposed to change his shoes, he rebelled absolutely, in spite of all
I could say on this point; and consequently he was recognized the moment he entered the ballroom.
He went straight to a masker, his hands behind his back, as usual, and attempted to enter into
an intrigue, and at the first question he asked was called Sire, in reply.  Whereupon, much
disappointed, he turned on his heel, and came back to me.  "You are right, Constant; I am recognized.
Bring me lace- boots and another costume."  I put the boots on his feet, and disguised him
anew, advising him to let his arms hang, if he did not wish to be recognized at once; and his
Majesty promised to obey in every particular what he called my instructions.  He had hardly
entered the room in his new costume, however, before he was accosted by a lady, who, seeing
him with his hands again crossed behind his back, said, "Sire, you are recognized!  "The Emperor
immediately let his arms fall; but it was too late, for already every one moved aside respectfully
to make room for him.  He then returned to his room, and took a third costume, promising me
implicitly to pay attention to his gestures and his walk, and offering to bet that he would
not be recognized.  This time, in fact, he entered the hall as if it were a barrack, pushing
and elbowing all around him; but, in spite of this, some one whispered in his ear, "Your Majesty
is recognized."  A new disappointment, new change of costume, and new advice on my part, with
the same result; until at last his Majesty left the ambassador's ball, persuaded that he could
not be disguised, and that the Emperor would be recognized whatever mask he might assume.

That evening at supper, the Prince de Neuchatel, the Duke de Trevise, the Duke de Frioul, and
some other officers being present, the Emperor related the history of his disguises, and made
many jests on his awkwardness.  In speaking of the young lady who had recognized him the evening
before, and who had, it appeared, puzzled him greatly, "Can you believe it, Messieurs," said
he, "I never succeeded in recognizing the little wretch at all?"  During the carnival the Empress
expressed a wish to go once to the masked ball at the opera; and when she begged the Emperor
to accompany her he refused, in spite of all the tender and enticing things the Empress could
say, and all the grace with which, as is well known, she could surround a petition.  She found
that all was useless, as the Emperor said plainly that he would not go.  "Well, I will go without
you."--"As you please," and the Emperor went out.

That evening at the appointed hour the Empress went to the ball; and the Emperor, who wished
to surprise her, had one of her femmes de chambre summoned, and obtained from her an exact
description of the Empress's costume.  He then told me to dress him in a domino, entered a
carriage without decorations, and accompanied by the grand marshal of the palace, a superior
officer, and myself, took the road to the opera.  On reaching the private entrance of the Emperor's
household, we encountered some difficulty, as the doorkeeper would not let us pass till I had
told my name and rank.  "These gentlemen are with you?"--"As you see."--"I beg your pardon,
Monsieur Constant; but it is because in such times as these there are always persons who try
to enter without paying."--"That is good!  That is good!" and the Emperor laughed heartily
at the doorkeeper's observations.  At last we entered, and having got as far as the hall, promenaded
in couples, I giving my arm to the Emperor, who said thou to me, and bade me reply in the same
way.  We gave each other fictitious names, the Emperor calling himself Auguste; the Duke de
Frioul, Francois; the superior officer, whose name escapes me, Charles; while I was Joseph.
As soon as his Majesty saw a domino similar to the one the femme de chambre had described,
he pressed my arm and said, "Is that she?"--"No, Si--- no, Auguste," replied I, constantly
correcting myself; for it was impossible to accustom myself to calling the Emperor otherwise
than Sire or your Majesty.  He had, as I have said, expressly ordered me to tutoy him; but
he was every moment compelled to repeat this order to me, for respect tied my tongue every
time I tried to say tu.  At last, after having gone in every direction, explored every corner
and nook of the saloon, the green-room, the boxes, etc., in fact, examined everything, and
looked each costume over in detail, his Majesty, who was no more successful in recognizing
her Majesty than were we, began to feel great anxiety, which I, however, succeeded in allaying
by telling him that doubtless the Empress had gone to change her costume.  As I was speaking,
a domino arrived who seemed enamoured of the Emperor, accosted him, mystified him, tormented
him in every way, and with so much vivacity that Auguste was beside himself; and it is impossible
to give even a faint idea of the comical sight the Emperor presented in his embarrassment.
The domino, delighted at this, redoubled her wit and raillery until, thinking it time to cease,
she disappeared in the crowd.

The Emperor was completely exasperated; he had seen enough, and we left the ball.

The next morning when he saw the Empress, he remarked, "Well, you did not go to the opera ball,
after all!"--"Oh, yes, indeed I did."--"Nonsense!" --"I assure you that I went.  And you, my
dear, what did you do all the evening?"--"I worked."--"Why, that is very singular; for I saw
at the ball last night a domino who had exactly your foot and boots.  I took him for you, and
consequently addressed him."  The Emperor laughed heartily on learning that he had been thus
duped; the Empress, just as she left for the ball, had changed her costume, not thinking the
first sufficiently elegant.

The carnival was extremely brilliant this year, and there were in Paris all kinds of masquerades.
The most amusing were those in which the theory advocated by the famous Doctor Gall [Franz
Joseph Gall, founder of the system of phrenology.  Born in Baden, 1758; died in Paris, 1825]
was illustrated.  I saw a troop passing the Place du Carrousel, composed of clowns, harlequins,
fishwives, etc., all rubbing their skulls, and making expressive grimaces; while a clown bore
several skulls of different sizes, painted red, blue, or green, with these inscriptions: Skull
of a robber, skull of an assassin, skull of a bankrupt, etc.; and a masked figure, representing
Doctor Gall, was seated on an ass, his head turned to the animal's tail, and receiving from
the hands of a woman who followed him, and was also seated on an ass, heads covered with wigs
made of long grass.

Her Majesty Queen Caroline gave a masked ball, at which the Emperor and Empress were present,
which was one of the most brilliant I have ever attended.

The opera of la Vestale was then new, and very much the fashion; it represented a quadrille
of priests and vestals who entered to the sound of delicious music on the flute and harp, and
in addition to this there were magicians, a Swiss marriage, Tyrolian betrothals, etc.  All
the costumes were wonderfully handsome and true to nature; and there had been arranged in the
apartments at the palace a supply of costumes which enabled the dancers to change four or five
times during the night, and which had the effect of renewing the ball as many times.

As I was dressing the Emperor for this ball, he said to me, "Constant, you must go with me
in disguise.  Take whatever costume you like, disguise yourself so that you cannot possibly
be recognized, and I will give you instructions."  I hastened to do as his Majesty ordered,
donned a Swiss costume which suited me very well, and thus equipped awaited his Majesty's orders.

He had a plan for mystifying several great personages, and two or three ladies whom the Emperor
designated to me with such minute details that it was impossible to mistake them, and told
me some singular things in regard to them,  which were not generally known, and were well calculated
to embarrass them terribly.  As I was starting, the Emperor called me back, saying, "Above
all, Constant, take care to make no mistake, and do not confound Madame de M---- with her sister;
they have almost exactly the same costume, but Madame de M--- is larger than she, so take care."
On my arrival at the ball, I sought and easily found the persons whom his Majesty had designated,
and the replies which they made afforded him much amusement when I narrated them as he was
retiring.

There was at this time a third marriage at the court, that of the Prince de Neuchatel and the
Princess of Bavaria, which was celebrated in the chapel of the Tuileries by Cardinal Fesch.

A traveler just returned from the Isle of France presented to the Empress a female monkey of
the orang-outang species; and her Majesty gave orders that the animal should be placed in the
menagerie at Malmaison. Then come that a common to brawl without all Hurons and Abnaki, which came

On the morning of the 15th of April, the Emperor had hardly recovered from the fatigue of his
journey, when he received the authorities of Bayonne, who came to congratulate him, and questioned
them, as was his custom, most pointedly.  His Majesty then set out to visit the fort and fortifications,
which occupied him till the evening, when he returned to the Government palace, which he occupied
temporarily while waiting till the chateau of Marrac should be ready to receive him.

On his return to the palace the Emperor expected to find the Infant Don Carlos, whom his brother
Ferdinand, the Prince of the Asturias, had sent to Bayonne to present his compliments to the
Emperor; but he was informed that the Infant was ill, and would not be able to come.  The Emperor
immediately gave orders to send one of his physicians to attend upon him, with a valet de chambre
and several other persons; for the prince had come to Bayonne without attendants, and incognito,
attended only by a military service composed of a few soldiers of the garrison.  The Emperor
also ordered that this service should be replaced by one more suitable, consisting of the Guard
of Honor of Bayonne, and sent two or three times each day to inquire the condition of the Infant,
who it was freely admitted in the palace was very ill.

On leaving the Government palace to take up his abode at Marrac, the Emperor gave all necessary
orders that it should be in readiness to receive the King and Queen of Spain, who were expected
at Bayonne the last of the month; and expressly recommended that everything should be done
to render to the sovereigns of Spain all the honors due their position.  Just as the Emperor
entered the chateau the sound of music was heard, and the grand marshal entered to inform his
Majesty that a large company of the inhabitants in the costume of the country were assembled
before the gate of the chateau.  The Emperor immediately went to the window; and, at sight
of him, seventeen persons (seven men and ten women) began with inimitable grace a dance called
'la pamperruque', in which the women kept time on tambourines, and the men with castanets,
to an orchestra composed of flutes and guitars.  I went out of the castle to view this scene
more closely.  The women wore short skirts of blue silk, and pink stockings likewise embroidered
in silver; their hair was tied with ribbons, and they wore very broad black bracelets, that
set off to advantage the dazzling whiteness of their bare arms.  The men wore tight- fitting
white breeches, with silk stockings and large epaulettes, a loose vest of very fine woolen
cloth ornamented with gold, and their hair caught up in a net like the Spaniards.

His Majesty took great pleasure in witnessing this dance, which is peculiar to the country
and very ancient, which the custom of the country has consecrated as a means of rendering homage
to great personages.  The Emperor remained at the window until the 'pamperruque' was finished,
and then sent to compliment the dancers on their skill, and to express his thanks to the inhabitants
assembled in crowds at the gate.

His Majesty a few days afterward received from his Royal Highness, the Prince of the Asturias,
a letter, in which he announced that he intended setting out from Irun, where he then was,
at an early day, in order to have the pleasure of making the acquaintance of his brother (it
was thus Prince Ferdinand called the Emperor); a pleasure which he had long desired, and which
he would at last enjoy if his good brother would allow him.  This letter was brought to the
Emperor by one of the aides-de-camp of the prince, who had accompanied him from Madrid, and
preceded him to Bayonne by only ten days.  His Majesty could hardly believe what he read and
heard; and I, with several other persons, heard him exclaim, "What, he is coming here?  but
you must be mistaken; he must be deceiving us; that cannot be possible!"  And I can certify
that, in these words, the Emperor manifested no pleasure at the announcement.

It was necessary, however, to make preparations to receive the prince, since he was certainly
coming; consequently the Prince of Neuchatel, the Duke of Frioul, and a chamberlain of honor,
were selected by his Majesty. And the guard of honor received orders to accompany these gentlemen,
and meet the Prince of Spain just outside the town of Bayonne; the rank which the Emperor recognized
in Ferdinand not rendering it proper that the escort should go as far as the frontier of the
two empires.  The Prince made his entrance into Bayonne at noon, on the 20th of April.  Lodgings
which would have been considered very inferior in Paris, but which were elegant in Bayonne,
had been prepared for him and his brother, the Infant Don Carlos, who was already installed
there.  Prince Ferdinand made a grimace on entering, but did not dare to complain aloud; and
certainly it would have been most improper for him to have done so, since it was not the Emperor's
fault that Bayonne possessed only one palace, which was at this time reserved for the king,
and, besides, this house, the handsomest in the town, was large and perfectly new.  Don Pedro
de Cevallos, who accompanied the prince, thought it horrible, and unfit for a royal personage.
It was the residence of the commissariat.  An hour after Ferdinand's arrival, the Emperor visited
him.  He was awaiting the Emperor at the door, and held out his arms on his approach; they
embraced, and ascended to his apartments, where they remained about half an hour, and when
they separated the prince wore a somewhat anxious air. His Majesty on his return charged the
grand marshal to convey to the prince and his brother, Don Carlos, the Duke of San-Carlos,
the Duke of Infantado, Don Pedro de Cevallos, and two or three other persons of the suite,
an invitation to dine with him; and the Emperor's carriages were sent for these illustrious
guests at the appointed hour, and they were conveyed to the chateau.  His Majesty descended
to the foot of the staircase to receive the prince; but this was the limit of his deference,
for not once during dinner did he give Prince Ferdinand, who was a king at Madrid, the title
of your majesty, nor even that of highness; nor did he accompany him on his departure any farther
than the first door of the saloon; and he afterwards informed him, by a message, that he would
have no other rank than that of Prince of the Asturias until the arrival of his father, King
Charles.  Orders were given at the same time to place on duty at the house of the princes,
the Bayonnaise guard of honor, with the Imperial Guard in addition to a detachment of picked
police.

On the 27th of April the Empress arrived from Bordeaux at seven o'clock in the evening, having
made no stay at Bayonne, where her arrival excited little enthusiasm, as they were perhaps
displeased that she did not stop there.  His Majesty received her with much tenderness, and
showed much solicitude as to the fatigue she must have experienced, since the roads were so
rough, and badly washed by the rains.  In the evening the town and chateau were illuminated.

Three days after, on the 30th, the King and Queen of Spain arrived at Bayonne; and it is impossible
to describe the homage which the Emperor paid them.  The Duke Charles de Plaisance went as
far as Irun, and the Prince de Neuchatel even to the banks of the Bidassoa, in order to pay
marked respect to their Catholic Majesties on the part of their powerful friend; and the king
and queen appeared to appreciate highly these marks of consideration.  A detachment of picked
troops, superbly uniformed, awaited them on the frontier, and served as their escort; the garrison
of Bayonne was put under arms, all the buildings of the port were decorated, all the bells
rang, and the batteries of both the citadel and the port saluted with great salvos.  The Prince
of the Asturias and his brother, hearing of the arrival of the king and queen, had left Bayonne
in order to meet their parents, when they encountered, a short distance from the town, two
or three grenadiers who had just left Vittoria, and related to them the following occurrence:

When their Spanish Majesties entered Vittoria, they found that a detachment of the Spanish
body guards, who had accompanied the Prince of the Asturias and were stationed in this town,
had taken possession of the palace which the king and queen were to occupy as they passed through,
and on the arrival of their Majesties had put themselves under arms.  As soon as the king perceived
this, he said to them in a severe tone, "You will understand why I ask you to quit my palace.
You have failed in your duty at Aranjuez.  I have no need of your services, and I do not wish
them.  Go!" These words, pronounced with an energy far from habitual to Charles IV., met with
no reply.  The detachment of the guards retired; and the king begged General Verdier to give
him a French guard, much grieved, he said, that he had not retained his brave riflemen, whose
colonel he still kept near him as captain of the guards.

This news could not give the Prince of the Asturias a high opinion of the welcome his father
had in store for him; and indeed he was very coolly received, as I shall now relate.

The King and Queen of Spain, on alighting at the governmental palace, found awaiting them the
grand marshal, the Duke de Frioul, who escorted them to their apartments, and presented to
them General Count Reille, the Emperor's aide-de-camp, performing the duties of governor of
the palace; M. d'Audenarde, equerry, with M. Dumanoir and M. de Baral, chamberlains charged
with the service of honor near their Majesties.

The grandees of Spain whom their Majesties found at Bayonne were the same who had followed
the Prince of the Asturias, and the sight of them, as may well be imagined, was not pleasant
to the king; and when the ceremony of the kissing of the hand took place, every one perceived
the painful agitation of the unfortunate sovereigns.  This ceremony, which consists of falling
on your knees and kissing the hand of the king and queen, was performed in the deepest silence,
as their Majesties spoke to no one but the Count of Fuentes, who by chance was at Bayonne.

The king hurried over this ceremony, which fatigued him greatly, and retired with the queen
into his apartments, where the Prince of the Asturias wished to follow them; but his father
stopped him at the door, and raising his arm as if to repulse him, said in a trembling tone,
"Prince, do you wish still to insult my gray hairs?" When the Frenchman were utilize the dignity

 He also told me that the prisoners
were left sometimes for thirty hours without food; that he had only a bed of straw, no linen,
no books, and no communication with the outside world; and that when he came out of his dungeon
to be sent to Colonel Marts, he presented a horrible appearance, with his long beard, and emaciated
frame, the result of mental distress and insufficient food.  He had worn the same shirt for
a month, as he had never been able to prevail on his captors to give him others; and his eyes
had been so long unaccustomed to the light that he was obliged to close them, and felt oppressed
in the open air.

On the road from Bayonne, there was handed to the prince a letter from the king and queen which
was stained with tears.  The prince said to his valet de chambre after reading it, "These are
the first consoling words I have received in a month, for every one has abandoned me except
my excellent masters.  The body guards, who have betrayed and sold their king, will also betray
and sell his son; and as for myself, I hope for nothing, except to be permitted to find an
asylum in France for my children and myself."  M. Marts having shown him newspapers in which
it was stated that the prince possessed a fortune of five hundred million, he exclaimed vehemently
that it was an atrocious calumny, and he defied his most cruel enemies to prove that.
