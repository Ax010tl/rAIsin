"To my supper and bed at Aberfoil," I replied.

"Are the passes open?" he inquired, with the same commanding tone of voice.

"I do not know," I replied; "I shall learn when I get there. But," I added, the fate of Morris
recurring to my recollection, "if you are an English stranger, I advise you to turn back till
daylight; there has been some disturbance in this neighbourhood, and I should hesitate to say
it is perfectly safe for strangers."

"The soldiers had the worst?--had they not?" was the reply.

"They had indeed; and an officer's party were destroyed or made prisoners."

"Are you sure of that?" replied the horseman.

"As sure as that I hear you speak," I replied. "I was an unwilling spectator of the skirmish."

"Unwilling!" continued the interrogator. "Were you not engaged in it then?"

"Certainly no," I replied; "I was detained by the king's officer."

"On what suspicion? and who are you? or what is your name?" he continued.

"I really do not know, sir," said I, "why I should answer so many questions to an unknown stranger.
I have told you enough to convince you that you are going into a dangerous and distracted country.
If you choose to proceed, it is your own affair; but as I ask you no questions respecting your
name and business, you will oblige me by making no inquiries after mine."

"Good God!" I exclaimed, like one thunderstruck, "can it be you, Miss Vernon, on such a spot--at
such an hour--in such a lawless country--in such"--

"In such a masculine dress, you would say.--But what would you have? The philosophy of the
excellent Corporal Nym is the best after all; things must be as they may--pauca verba."

While she was thus speaking, I eagerly took advantage of an unusually bright gleam of moonshine,
to study the appearance of her companion; for it may be easily supposed, that finding Miss
Vernon in a place so solitary, engaged in a journey so dangerous, and under the protection
of one gentleman only, were circumstances to excite every feeling of jealousy, as well as surprise.
The rider did not speak with the deep melody of Rashleigh's voice; his tones were more high
and commanding; he was taller, moreover, as he sate on horseback, than that first-rate object
of my hate and suspicion. Neither did the stranger's address resemble that of any of my other
cousins; it had that indescribable tone and manner by which we recognise a man of sense and
breeding, even in the first few sentences he speaks.

The object of my anxiety seemed desirous to get rid of my investigation.

"Diana," he said, in a tone of mingled kindness and authority, "give your cousin his property,
and let us not spend time here."

Miss Vernon had in the meantime taken out a small case, and leaning down from her horse towards
me, she said, in a tone in which an effort at her usual quaint lightness of expression contended
with a deeper and more grave tone of sentiment, "You see, my dear coz, I was born to be your
better angel. Rashleigh has been compelled to yield up his spoil, and had we reached this same
village of Aberfoil last night, as we purposed, I should have found some Highland sylph to
have wafted to you all these representatives of commercial wealth. But there were giants and
dragons in the way; and errant-knights and damsels of modern times, bold though they be, must
not, as of yore, run into useless danger--Do not you do so either, my dear coz."

"Diana," said her companion, "let me once more warn you that the evening waxes late, and we
are still distant from our home."

"I am coming, sir, I am coming--Consider," she added, with a sigh, "how lately I have been
subjected to control--besides, I have not yet given my cousin the packet, and bid him fare-well--for
ever. Yes, Frank," she said, "for ever!--there is a gulf between us--a gulf of absolute perdition;--where
we go, you must not follow--what we do, you must not share in--Farewell--be happy!"

In the attitude in which she bent from her horse, which was a Highland pony, her face, not
perhaps altogether unwillingly, touched mine. She pressed my hand, while the tear that trembled
in her eye found its way to my cheek instead of her own. It was but a moment, however; for,
instantly recovering from the feeling to which she had involuntarily given way, she intimated
to her companion she was ready to attend him, and putting their horses to a brisk pace, they
were soon far distant from the place where I stood.

Heaven knows, it was not apathy which loaded my frame and my tongue so much, that I could neither
return Miss Vernon's half embrace, nor even answer her farewell. The word, though it rose to
my tongue, seemed to choke in my throat like the fatal guilty, which the delinquent who makes
it his plea, knows must be followed by the doom of death. The surprise--the sorrow, almost
stupified me. I remained motionless with the packet in my hand, gazing after them, as if endeavouring
to count the sparkles which flew from the horses' hoofs. I continued to look after even these
had ceased to be visible, and to listen for their footsteps long after the last distant trampling
had died in my ears. At length, tears rushed to my eyes, glazed as they were by the exertion
of straining after what was no longer to be seen. I wiped them mechanically, and almost without
being aware that they were flowing--but they came thicker and thicker; I felt the tightening
of the throat and breast--the hysterica passio of poor Lear; and sitting down by the wayside,
I shed a flood of the first and most bitter tears which had flowed from my eyes since childhood.

CHAPTER SEVENTEEN.

     Dangle.--Egad, I think the interpreter is the harder to be
          understood of the two.
                                        Critic.

I had scarce given vent to my feelings in this paroxysm, ere was ashamed of my weakness. I
remembered that I had been for some time endeavouring to regard Diana Vernon, when her idea
intruded itself on my remembrance, as a friend, for whose welfare I should indeed always be
anxious, but with whom I could have little further communication. But the almost unrepressed
tenderness of her manner, joined to the romance of our sudden meeting where it was so little
to have been expected, were circumstances which threw me entirely off my guard. I recovered,
however, sooner than might have been expected, and without giving myself time accurately to
examine my motives. I resumed the path on which I had been travelling when overtaken by this
strange and unexpected apparition.

"I am not," was my reflection, "transgressing her injunction so pathetically given, since I
am but pursuing my own journey by the only open route.--If I have succeeded in recovering my
father's property, it still remains incumbent on me to see my Glasgow friend delivered from
the situation in which he has involved himself on my account; besides, what other place of
rest can I obtain for the night excepting at the little inn of Aberfoil? They also must stop
there, since it is impossible for travellers on horseback to go farther--Well, then, we shall
meet again--meet for the last time perhaps--But I shall see and hear her--I shall learn who
this happy man is who exercises over her the authority of a husband--I shall learn if there
remains, in the difficult course in which she seems engaged, any difficulty which my efforts
may remove, or aught that I can do to express my gratitude for her generosity--for her disinterested
friendship."

As I reasoned thus with myself, colouring with every plausible pretext which occurred to my
ingenuity my passionate desire once more to see and converse with my cousin, I was suddenly
hailed by a touch on the shoulder; and the deep voice of a Highlander, who, walking still faster
than I, though I was proceeding at a smart pace, accosted me with, "A braw night, Maister Osbaldistone--we
have met at the mirk hour before now."

There was no mistaking the tone of MacGregor; he had escaped the pursuit of his enemies, and
was in full retreat to his own wilds and to his adherents. He had also contrived to arm himself,
probably at the house of some secret adherent, for he had a musket on his shoulder, and the
usual Highland weapons by his side. To have found myself alone with such a character in such
a situation, and at this late hour in the evening, might not have been pleasant to me in any
ordinary mood of mind; for, though habituated to think of Rob Roy in rather a friendly point
of view, I will confess frankly that I never heard him speak but that it seemed to thrill my
blood. The intonation of the mountaineers gives a habitual depth and hollowness to the sound
of their words, owing to the guttural expression so common in their native language, and they
usually speak with a good deal of emphasis. To these national peculiarities Rob Roy added a
sort of hard indifference of accent and manner, expressive of a mind neither to be daunted,
nor surprised, nor affected by what passed before him, however dreadful, however sudden, however
afflicting. Habitual danger, with unbounded confidence in his own strength and sagacity, had
rendered him indifferent to fear, and the lawless and precarious life he led had blunted, though
its dangers and errors had not destroyed, his feelings for others. And it was to be remembered
that I had very lately seen the followers of this man commit a cruel slaughter on an unarmed
and suppliant individual.

Yet such was the state of my mind, that I welcomed the company of the outlaw leader as a relief
to my own overstrained and painful thoughts; and was not without hopes that through his means
I might obtain some clew of guidance through the maze in which my fate had involved me. I therefore
answered his greeting cordially, and congratulated him on his late escape in circumstances
when escape seemed impossible.

"Ay," he replied, "there is as much between the craig and the woodie* as there is between the
cup and the lip. But my peril was less than you may think, being a stranger to this country.

* i.e. The throat and the withy. Twigs of willow, such as bind faggots, were often used for
halters in Scotland and Ireland, being a sage economy of hemp.

Of those that were summoned to take me, and to keep me, and to retake me again, there was a
moiety, as cousin Nicol Jarvie calls it, that had nae will that I suld be either taen, or keepit
fast, or retaen; and of tother moiety, there was as half was feared to stir me; and so I had
only like the fourth part of fifty or sixty men to deal withal."

"And enough, too, I should think," replied I.

"I dinna ken that," said he; "but I ken, that turn every ill-willer that I had amang them out
upon the green before the Clachan of Aberfoil, I wad find them play with broadsword and target,
one down and another come on."

He now inquired into my adventures since we entered his country, and laughed heartily at my
account of the battle we had in the inn, and at the exploits of the Bailie with the red-hot poker.

"Let Glasgow Flourish!" he exclaimed. "The curse of Cromwell on me, if I wad hae wished better
sport than to see cousin Nicol Jarvie singe Iverach's plaid, like a sheep's head between a
pair of tongs. But my cousin Jarvie," he added, more gravely, "has some gentleman's bluid in
his veins, although he has been unhappily bred up to a peaceful and mechanical craft, which
could not but blunt any pretty man's spirit.--Ye may estimate the reason why I could not receive
you at the Clachan of Aberfoil as I purposed. They had made a fine hosenet for me when I was
absent twa or three days at Glasgow, upon the king's business--But I think I broke up the league
about their lugs--they'll no be able to hound one clan against another as they hae dune. I
hope soon to see the day when a' Hielandmen will stand shouther to shouther. But what chanced
next?"

I gave him an account of the arrival of Captain Thornton and his party, and the arrest of the
Bailie and myself under pretext of our being suspicious persons; and upon his more special
inquiry, I recollected the officer had mentioned that, besides my name sounding suspicious
in his ears, he had orders to secure an old and young person, resembling our description. To have reason

Mr. to start to lads.***** the Danger.
 But I am come back, nae thanks to him, or them
that employed him; and the question is, how the collector loon is to win back himsell--I promise
him it will not be without a ransom."

"Morris," said I, "has already paid the last ransom which mortal man can owe."

"Eh! What?" exclaimed my companion hastily; "what d'ye say? I trust it was in the skirmish
he was killed?"

"He was slain in cold blood after the fight was over, Mr. Campbell."

"Cold blood?--Damnation!" he said, muttering betwixt his teeth--"How fell that, sir? Speak
out, sir, and do not Maister or Campbell me--my foot is on my native heath, and my name is
MacGregor!"

His passions were obviously irritated; but without noticing the rudeness of his tone, I gave
him a short and distinct account of the death of Morris. He struck the butt of his gun with
great vehemence against the ground, and broke out--"I vow to God, such a deed might make one
forswear kin, clan, country, wife, and bairns! And yet the villain wrought long for it. And
what is the difference between warsling below the water wi' a stane about your neck, and wavering
in the wind wi' a tether round it?--it's but choking after a', and he drees the doom he ettled
for me. I could have wished, though, they had rather putten a ball through him, or a dirk;
for the fashion of removing him will give rise to mony idle clavers--But every wight has his
weird, and we maun a' dee when our day comes--And naebody will deny that Helen MacGregor has
deep wrongs to avenge."

So saying, he seemed to dismiss the theme altogether from his mind, and proceeded to inquire
how I got free from the party in whose hands he had seen me. 

As i had been drilling all an council, and had spent the face there will presume soon to speak me maun

or in a order.

and maimed, am i felt that i needed as a wild or famous invigoration.

would not be more cordial to have yours shot-cordial and green matters, as i demurred. "will

"He recognised joan," i cried, "robin't waived you think i might presume Johann waived to-communication?"
 Other
young women have sold themselves for gold, or suffered themselves to be seduced from their
first love from vanity; but Diana had sacrificed my affections and her own to partake the fortunes
of some desperate adventurer--to seek the haunts of freebooters through midnight deserts, with
no better hopes of rank or fortune than that mimicry of both which the mock court of the Stuarts
at St. Germains had in their power to bestow.

"I will see her," I said internally, "if it be possible, once more. I will argue with her as
a friend--as a kinsman--on the risk she is incurring, and I will facilitate her retreat to
France, where she may, with more comfort and propriety, as well as safety, abide the issue
of the turmoils which the political trepanner, to whom she has united her fate, is doubtless
busied in putting into motion."

"I conclude, then," I said to MacGregor, after about five minutes' silence on both sides, "that
his Excellency, since you give me no other name for him, was residing in Osbaldistone Hall
at the same time with myself?"

"To be sure--to be sure--and in the young lady's apartment, as best reason was." This gratuitous
information was adding gall to bitterness. "But few," added MacGregor, "ken'd he was derned
there, save Rashleigh and Sir Hildebrand; for you were out o' the question; and the young lads
haena wit eneugh to ca' the cat frae the cream--But it's a bra' auld-fashioned house, and what
I specially admire is the abundance o' holes and bores and concealments--ye could put twenty
or thirty men in ae corner, and a family might live a week without finding them out--whilk,
nae doubt, may on occasion be a special convenience. I wish we had the like o' Osbaldistone
Hall on the braes o' Craig-Royston--But we maun gar woods and caves serve the like o' us puir
Hieland bodies."

"I suppose his Excellency," said I, "was privy to the first accident which befell"--

I could not help hesitating a moment.

"Ye were going to say Morris," said Rob Roy coolly, for he was too much accustomed to deeds
of violence for the agitation he had at first expressed to be of long continuance. "I used
to laugh heartily at that reik; but I'll hardly hae the heart to do't again, since the ill-far'd
accident at the Loch. Na, na--his Excellency ken'd nought o' that ploy--it was a' managed atween

dealings with the shop-tolerance girls. You see one easily pays influence. Case the Compliment
on nae thinking that he has something beautiful to wisdom about this things which matter.


"May I ask," said I, "how Miss Vernon came to have so much influence over Rashleigh and his
accomplices as to derange your projected plan?"

"Mine! it was none of mine. No man can say I ever laid my burden on other folk's shoulders--it
was a' Rashleigh's doings. But, undoubtedly, she had great influence wi' us baith on account
of his Excellency's affection, as weel as that she ken'd far ower mony secrets to be lightlied
in a matter o' that kind.--Deil tak him," he ejaculated, by way of summing up, "that gies women
either secret to keep or power to abuse--fules shouldna hae chapping-sticks."

We were now within a quarter of a mile from the village, when three Highlanders, springing
upon us with presented arms, commanded us to stand and tell our business. The single word Gregaragh,
in the deep and commanding voice of my companion, was answered by a shout, or rather yell,
of joyful recognition. One, throwing down his firelock, clasped his leader so fast round the
knees, that he was unable to extricate himself, muttering, at the same time, a torrent of Gaelic
gratulation, which every now and then rose into a sort of scream of gladness. The two others,
after the first howling was over, set off literally with the speed of deers, contending which
should first carry to the village, which a strong party of the MacGregors now occupied, the
joyful news of Rob Roy's escape and return. The intelligence excited such shouts of jubilation,
that the very hills rung again, and young and old, men, women, and children, without distinction
of sex or age, came running down the vale to meet us, with all the tumultuous speed and clamour
of a mountain torrent. When I heard the rushing noise and yells of this joyful multitude approach
us, I thought it a fitting precaution to remind MacGregor that I was a stranger, and under
his protection. He accordingly held me fast by the hand, while the assemblage crowded around
him with such shouts of devoted attachment, and joy at his return, as were really affecting;
nor did he extend to his followers what all eagerly sought, the grasp, namely, of his hand,
until he had made them understand that I was to be kindly and carefully used.

The mandate of the Sultan of Delhi could not have been more promptly obeyed. Indeed, I now
sustained nearly as much inconvenience from their well-meant attentions as formerly from their
rudeness. They would hardly allow the friend of their leader to walk upon his own legs, so
earnest were they in affording me support and assistance upon the way; and at length, taking
advantage of a slight stumble which I made over a stone, which the press did not permit me
to avoid, they fairly seized upon me, and bore me in their arms in triumph towards Mrs. MacAlpine's.

On arrival before her hospitable wigwam, I found power and popularity had its inconveniences
in the Highlands, as everywhere else; for, before MacGregor could be permitted to enter the
house where he was to obtain rest and refreshment, he was obliged to relate the story of his
escape at least a dozen times over, as I was told by an officious old man, who chose to translate
it at least as often for my edification, and to whom I was in policy obliged to seem to pay
a decent degree of attention. Of anyone what do you have state to die maine. You die i sabe na, pablo?

So saying, he drank up the contents of the cup with great gravity and deliberation, while MacGregor
winked aside to me, as if in ridicule of the air of wisdom and superior authority which the
Bailie assumed towards him in their intercourse, and which he exercised when Rob was at the
head of his armed clan, in full as great, or a greater degree, than when he was at the Bailie's
mercy in the Tolbooth of Glasgow. It seemed to me, that MacGregor wished me, as a stranger,
to understand, that if he submitted to the tone which his kinsman assumed, it was partly out
of deference to the rights of hospitality, but still more for the jest's sake.

As the Bailie set down his cup he recognised me, and giving me a cordial welcome on my return,
he waived farther communication with me for the present.--"I will speak to your matters anon;
I maun begin, as in reason, wi' those of my kinsman.--I presume, Robin, there's naebody here
will carry aught o' what I am gaun to say, to the town-council or elsewhere, to my prejudice
or to yours?" 

From the door to the chamber do they were decorate on your account-law or even ivory; with the walls at

noble, but evident self-trusting.

"Aweel, cousin, sic being the case, and Mr. Osbaldistone here being a prudent youth, and a
safe friend--I'se plainly tell ye, ye are breeding up your family to gang an ill gate." Then,
clearing his voice with a preliminary hem, he addressed his kinsman, checking, as Malvolio
proposed to do when seated in his state, his familiar smile with an austere regard of control.--"Ye
ken yourself ye haud light by the law--and for my cousin Helen, forbye that her reception o'
me this blessed day--whilk I excuse on account of perturbation of mind, was muckle on the north
side o' friendly, I say (outputting this personal reason of complaint) I hae that to say o'
your wife"--

"Say nothing of her, kinsman," said Rob, in a grave and stern tone, "but what is befitting
a friend to say, and her husband to hear. Of wigwam of s Roy, that i did tell thee that they did not exploit when

but laugh and fleer at me when I tauld them my mind on their ignorance--It's my belief they
can neither read, write, nor cipher, if sic a thing could be believed o' ane's ain connections
in a Christian land."

"If they could, kinsman," said MacGregor, with great indifference, "their learning must have
come o' free will, for whar the deil was I to get them a teacher?--wad ye hae had me put on
the gate o' your Divinity Hall at Glasgow College, 'Wanted, a tutor for Rob Roy's bairns?'"

"Na, kinsman," replied Mr. Jarvie, "but ye might hae sent the lads whar they could hae learned
