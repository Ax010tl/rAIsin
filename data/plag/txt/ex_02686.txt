"What if, when the poor leper came to the Lord to be healed, he had said to Peter, or some
other understrapper, 'Here, Peter, you go touch that fellow and I'll pay you for it'? Or what
if the Lord, when he came on earth, had come a day at a time and brought his lunch with him,
and had gone home to heaven overnight? Would the world ever have come to call him brother?
We have got to give, not our old clothes, not our prayers. Those are cheap. You can kneel down
on a carpet and pray where it is warm and comfortable. Not our soup--that is sometimes very
cheap. Not our money--a stingy man will give money when he refuses to give himself. Just so
soon as a man feels that you sit down alongside of him in loving sympathy with him, notwithstanding
his poor, notwithstanding his sick and his debased, estate, just so soon you begin to worm
your way into the very warmest spot in his life."

It was plain talk, but it was good. They whispered afterward in the corners about the "lack
of discretion of that good man Parkhurst." A little of that lack would go a long way toward
cleaning up in New York--did go, not so many years after Worse shocks than that were coming
from the same quarter to rattle the dry bones.

Long before that the "something that needed me" in Mulberry Street had come. I was in a death-grapple
vith my two enemies, the police lodging-room and the Bend. The Adler Commission had proposed
to "break the back" of the latter by cutting Leonard Street through the middle of it--an expedient
that had been suggested forty years before, when the Five Points around the corner challenged
the angry resentment of the community.  But no expedient would ever cover that case. The whole
slum had to go. A bill was introduced in the Legislature to wipe it out bodily, and in 1888,
after four years of pulling and hauling, we had spunked up enough to file maps for the "Mulberry
Bend Park." Blessed promise! And it was kept, if it did take a prodigious lot of effort, for
right there decency had to begin, or not at all. Go and look at it to-day and see what it is like.

But that is another story. The other nuisance came first. The first guns that I have any record
of were fired in my newspapers in 1883, and from that time till Theodore Roosevelt shut up
the vile dens in 1895 the battle raged without intermission.  The guns I speak of were not
the first that were fired--they were the first I fired so far as I can find. For quite a generation
before that there had been protests and complaints from the police surgeons, the policemen
themselves who hated to lodge under one roof with tramps, from citizen bodies that saw in the
system an outrage upon Christian charity and all decency, but all without producing any other
effect than spasmodic whitewashing and the ineffectual turning on of the hose. Nothing short
of boiling water would have cleansed those dens. Nothing else came of it, because stronger
even than the selfish motive that exploits public office for private gain is the deadly inertia
in civic life which simply means that we are all as lazy as things will let us be.  The older
I get, the more patience I have with the sinner, and the less with the lazy good-for-nothing
who is at the bottom of more than half the share of the world's troubles. Give me the thief
if need be, but take the tramp away and lock him up at hard labor until he is willing to fall
in line and take up his end. The end he lets lie some one has got to carry who already has enough.

I ran to earth at last one of the citizens' bodies that were striving with the nuisance, and
went and joined it. I will not say that I was received graciously.  I was a reporter, and it
was human nature to assume that I was merely after a sensation; and I did make a sensation
of the campaign. That was the way to put life into it. Page after page I printed, now in this
paper, now in that, and when the round was completed, went over the same road again. They winced
a bit, my associates, but bore it, egged me on even. Anything for a change.  Perchance it might
help. It didn't then. But slowly something began to stir. The editors found something to be
indignant about when there was nothing else. Ponderous leaders about our "duty toward the poor"
appeared at intervals. The Grand Jury on its tours saw and protested. The City Hall felt the
sting and squirmed. I remember when we went to argue with the Board of Estimate and Apportionment
under Mayor Grant. It was my first meeting with Mrs. Josephine Shaw Lowell and John Finley,
but not the last by a good many, thank God for that! I had gone to Boston to see the humane
way in which they were dealing with their homeless there. They gave them a clean shirt and
a decent bed and a bath--good way, that, to limit the supply of tramps--and something to eat
in the morning, so they did not have to go out and beg the first thing. It seemed good to me,
and it was good.  But the Mayor did not think so.

"Boston! Boston!" he cried, impatiently, and waved us and the subject aside. "I am tired of
hearing always how they do in Boston, and of the whole matter."

So were we, tired enough to keep it up. We came back next time, though it didn't do any good,
and meanwhile the newspaper broadsides continued.  No chance was allowed to pass of telling
the people of New York what they were harboring. They simply needed to know, I felt sure of
that. And I know now that I was right. But it takes a lot of telling to make a city know when
it is doing wrong.  However, that was what I was there for. When it didn't seem to help, I
would go and look at a stone-cutter hammering away at his rock perhaps a hundred times without
as much as a crack showing in it. Yet at the hundred and first blow it would split in two,
and I knew it was not that blow that did it, but all that had gone before together. When my
fellow-workers smiled, I used to remind them of the Israelites that marched seven times around
Jericho and blew their horns before the walls fell.

"Well, you go ahead and blow yours," they said; "you have the faith."

And I did, and the walls did fall, though it took nearly twice seven years. But they came down,
as the walls of ignorance and indifference must every time, if you blow hard enough and long
enough, with faith in your cause and in your fellow-man. It is just a question of endurance.
If you keep it up, they can't.

They began to give, those grim walls, when typhus fever broke out in the city in the winter
of 1891-92.  The wonder was that it did not immediately centre in the police lodging-rooms.
There they lay, young and old, hardened tramps and young castaways with minds and souls soft
as wax for their foulness to be stamped upon[Footnote: The old cry of sensation mongering was
raised more than once when I was making my charges. People do not like to have their rest disturbed.
Particularly did the critics object to the statement that there were young people in the dens;
they were all old tramps, they said. For an answer I went in and photographed the boys and
girls one night, and held their pictures up before the community. In the Oak Street Station
alone, one of the vilest, there were six as likely young fellows as I ever saw, herded with
forty tramps and thieves. Not one of them would come out unscathed.], on bare floors of stone
or planks.

Dirty as they came in from every vile contact, they went out in the morning to scatter from
door to door, where they begged their breakfast, the seeds of festering disease. Turning the
plank was "making the bed." Typhus is a filth-disease, of all the most dreaded. If ever it
got a foothold in those dens, there was good cause for fear. I drew up at once a remonstrance,
had it signed by representatives of the united charitable societies--some of them shrugged
their shoulders, but they signed--and took it to the Health Board. They knew the danger better
than I. But the time had not yet come. Perhaps they thought, with the reporters, that I was
just "making copy." For I made a "beat" of the story. Of course I did. We were fighting; and
if I could brace the boys up to the point of running their own campaigns for making things
better, so much was gained. But they did not take the hint. They just denounced my "treachery."

I warned them that there would be trouble with the lodging-rooms, and within eleven months
the prophecy came true. The typhus broke out there.  The night after the news had come I took
my camera and flashlight and made the round of the dens, photographing them all with their
crowds. Of the negatives I had lantern-slides made, and with these under my arm knocked at
the doors of the Academy of Medicine, demanding to be let in. That was the place for that discussion,
it seemed to me, for the doctors knew the real extent of the peril we were then facing. Typhus
is no respecter of persons, and it is impossible to guard against it as against the smallpox.
They let me in, and that night's doings gave the cause of decency a big push. I think that
was the first time I told the real story of my dog.  I had always got around it somehow; it
choked me even then, twenty years after and more, anger boiled up in me so at the recollection.

We pleaded merely for the execution of a law that had been on the statute-books six years and
over, permitting the city authorities to establish a decent lodging-house; but though the police,
the health officials, the grand jury, the charitable societies, and about everybody of any
influence in the community fell in behind the medical profession in denouncing the evils that
were, we pleaded in vain.  The Tammany officials at the City Hall told us insolently to go
ahead and build lodging-houses ourselves; they had other things to use the city's money for
than to care for the homeless poor; which, indeed, was true. The Charity Organization Society
that stood for all the rest gave up in discouragement and announced its intention to start
a Wayfarer's Lodge itself, on the Boston plan, and did so. "You see," was the good-by with
which my colaborers left me, "we will never succeed." My campaign had collapsed.

But even then we were winning. Never was defeat in all that time that did not in the end turn
out a step toward victory. This much the unceasing agitation had effected, though its humane
purpose made no impression on the officials, that the accommodation for lodgers in the station-houses
was sensibly shrunk. Where there had been forty that took them in, there were barely two dozen
left.  The demand for separate women's prisons with police matrons in charge, which was one
of the phases the new demand for decency was assuming, bred a scarcity of house-room, and one
by one the foul old dens were closed and not reopened. The nuisance was perishing of itself.
Each time a piece of it sloughed off, I told the story again in print, "lest we forget." In
another year reform came, and with it came Roosevelt. The Committee on Vagrancy, a volunteer
body of the Charity Organization Society, of which Mrs. Lowell was the head and I a member,
unlimbered its guns again and opened fire, and this time the walls came down. For Tammany was out.

We had been looking the police over by night, Roosevelt and I. We had inspected the lodging-rooms
while I went over the long fight with him, and had come at last, at 2 A.M., to the Church Street
Station. It was raining outside. The light flickered, cold and cheerless, in the green lamps
as we went up the stone steps. Involuntarily I looked in the corner for my little dog; but
it was not there, or any one who remembered it. The sergeant glanced over his blotter grimly,
I had almost to pinch myself to make sure I was not shivering in a linen duster, wet to the
skin. Down the cellar steps to the men's lodging-room I led the President of the Police Board.
It was unchanged--just as it was the day I slept there. Three men lay stretched at full length
on the dirty planks, two of them young lads from the country. Standing there, I told Mr.  Roosevelt
my own story. He turned alternately red and white with anger as he heard it.

"Did they do that to you?" he asked when I had ended. For an answer I pointed to the young
lads then asleep before him.

"I was like this one," I said.

He struck his clenched fists together. "I will smash them to-morrow."

He was as good as his word. The very next day the Police Board took the matter up. Provision
was made for the homeless on a barge in the East River until plans could be perfected for sifting
the tramps from the unfortunate; and within a week, on recommendation of the Chief of Police,
orders were issued to close the doors of the police lodging-rooms on February 15, 1896, never
again to be unbarred.

The battle was won. The murder of my dog was avenged, and forgiven, after twenty-five years.
The yellow newspapers, with the true instinct that made them ever recognize in Roosevelt the
implacable enemy of all they stood for, printed cartoons of homeless men shivering at a barred
door "closed by order of T. Roosevelt"; but they did not, after all, understand the man they
were attacking. That the thing was right was enough for him. Their shafts went wide of the
mark, or fell harmless. The tramps for whom New York had been a paradise betook themselves
to other towns not so discerning--went to Chicago, where the same wicked system was in operation
until last spring, is yet for all I know--and the honestly homeless got a chance.  A few tender-hearted
and soft-headed citizens, of the kind who ever obstruct progress by getting some very excellent
but vagrant impulses mixed up with a lack of common sense, wasted their sympathy upon the departing
hobo, but soon tired of it.  I remember the case of one tramp whose beat was in the block in
Thirty-fifth Street in which Dr.  Parkhurst lives. He was arrested for insolence to a housekeeper
who refused him food. The magistrate discharged him, with some tearful remarks about the world's
cruelty and the right of a man to be poor without being accounted a criminal.  Thus encouraged,
the tramp went right back and broke the windows of the house that had repelled him. I presume
he is now in the city by the lake holding up people who offend him by being more industrious
and consequently more prosperous than he.

For the general results of the victory so laboriously achieved I must refer to [Footnote: Now,
"The Battle with the Slum."] "A Ten Years' War," in which I endeavored to sum up the situation
as I saw it.  They are not worked out yet to the full. The most important link is missing.
That is to be a farm-school which shall sift the young idler from the heap of chaff, and win
him back to habits of industry and to the world of men. It will come when moral purpose has
been reestablished at the City Hall. I have not set out here to discuss reform and its merits,
but merely to point out that the way of it, the best way of bringing it on--indeed, the only
way that is always open--is to make the facts of the wrong plain. And, having said that, I
have put the reporter where he belongs and answered the question why I have never wanted executive
office and never will.

And now, in taking leave of this subject, of which I hope I may never hear again, for it has
plagued me enough and had its full share of my life, is there not one ray of brightness that
falls athwart its gloom? Were they all bad, those dens I hated, yes, hated, with the shame
and the sorrow and hopeless surrender they stood for? Was there not one glimpse of mercy that
dwells in the memory with redeeming touch? Yes, one. Let it stand as testimony that on the
brink of hell itself human nature is not wholly lost. There is still the spark of His image,
however overlaid by the slum. And let it forever wipe out the score of my dog, and mine. It
was in one of the worst that I came upon a young girl, pretty, innocent--Heaven knows how she
had landed there. She hid her head in her apron and wept bitterly with the shame of the thing.
Around her half a dozen old hags, rum-sodden and foul, camped on the stone floor. As in passing
I stooped over the weeping girl, one of them, thinking I was one of the men about the place,
and misunderstanding my purpose, sprang between us like a tigress and pushed me back.

"Not her!" she cried, and shook her fist at me; "not her! It is all right with us. We are old
and tough. But she is young, and don't you dare!"

I went out and stood under the stars, and thanked God that I was born. Only tramps! It had
been dinned into my ears until I said it myself, God forgive me! Aye, that was what we had
made of them with our infernal machinery of rum-shop, tenement, dive, and--this place. With
Christian charity instead, what might they not have been?

CHAPTER XI

THE BEND IS LAID BY THE HEELS

If there be any to whom the travail through which we have just come seems like a mighty tempest
in a teapot, let him quit thinking so. It was not a small matter. To be sure, the wrong could
have been undone in a day by the authorities, had they been so minded. That it was not undone
was largely, and illogically, because no one had a word to say in its defence. When there are
two sides to a thing, it is not difficult to get at the right of it in an argument, and to
carry public opinion for the right. But when there is absolutely nothing to be said against
a proposed reform, it seems to be human nature--American human nature, at all events--to expect
it to carry itself through with the general good wishes but no particular lift from any one.
It is a very charming expression of our faith in the power of the right to make its way, only
it is all wrong: it will not make its way in the generation that sits by to see it move. It
has got to be moved along, like everything else in this world, by men. That is how we take
title to the name. That is what is the matter with half our dead-letter laws. The other half
were just still-born. It is so, at this moment, with the children's playgrounds in New York.
Probably all thinking people subscribe to-day to the statement that it is the business of the
municipality to give its children a chance to play, just as much as to give them schools to
go to. Everybody applauds it.  The authorities do not question it; but still they do not provide
playgrounds. Private charity has to keep a beggarly half-dozen going where there ought to be
forty or fifty, as a matter of right, not of charity. Call it official conservatism, inertia,
treachery, call it by soft names or hard; in the end it comes to this, I suppose, that it is
the whetstone upon which our purpose is sharpened, and in that sense we have apparently got
to be thankful for it.  So a man may pummel his adversary and accept him as a means of grace
at the same time. If there were no snags, there would be no wits to clear them away, or strong
arms to wield the axe.  It was the same story with the Mulberry Bend.  Until the tramp lodging-houses
were closed, until the Bend was gone, it seemed as if progress were flat down impossible. As
I said, decency had to begin there, or not at all.

Before I tackle the Bend, perhaps I had better explain how I came to take up photographing
as a--no, not exactly as a pastime. It was never that with me. I had use for it, and beyond
that I never went. I am downright sorry to confess here that I am no good at all as a photographer,
for I would like to be. The thing is a constant marvel to me, and an unending delight. To watch
the picture come out upon the plate that was blank before, and that saw with me for perhaps
the merest fraction of a second, maybe months before, the thing it has never forgotten, is
a new miracle every time. If I were a clergyman I would practise photography and preach about
it. But I am jealous of the miracle.  I do not want it explained to me in terms of HO(2) or
such like formulas, learned, but so hopelessly unsatisfying. I do not want my butterfly stuck
on a pin and put in a glass case. I want to see the sunlight on its wings as it flits from
flower to flower, and I don't care a rap what its Latin name may be.  Anyway, it is not its
name. The sun and the flower and the butterfly know that. The man who sticks a pin in it does
not, and never will, for he knows not its language. Only the poet does among men.  So, you
see, I am disqualified from being a photographer. Also, I am clumsy, and impatient of details.
The axe was ever more to my liking than the graving-tool. I have lived to see the day of the
axe and enjoy it, and now I rejoice in the coming of the men and women who know; the Jane Addamses,
who to heart add knowledge and training, and with gentle hands bind up wounds which, alas!
too often I struck. It is as it should be. I only wish they would see it and leave me out for
my sins.

But there! I started out to tell about how I came to be a photographer, and here I am, off
on the subject of philanthropy and social settlements. To be precise, then, I began taking
pictures by proxy. It was upon my midnight trips with the sanitary police that the wish kept
cropping up in me that there were some way of putting before the people what I saw there. A
drawing might have done it, but I cannot draw, never could. There are certain sketches of mine
now on record that always arouse the boisterous hilarity of the family. They were made for
the instruction of our first baby in wolf-lore, and I know they were highly appreciated by
him at the time. Maybe the fashion in wolves has changed since. But, anyway, a drawing would
not have been evidence of the kind I wanted. We used to go in the small hours of the morning
into the worst tenements to count noses and see if the law against overcrowding was violated,
and the sights I saw there gripped my heart until I felt that I must tell of them, or burst,
or turn anarchist, or something.  "A man may be a man even in a palace" in modern New York
as in ancient Rome, but not in a slum tenement. So it seemed to me, and in anger I looked around
for something to strike off his fetters with. But there was nothing.

I wrote, but it seemed to make no impression.  One morning, scanning my newspaper at the breakfast
table, I put it down with an outcry that startled my wife, sitting opposite. There it was,
the thing I had been looking for all those years. A four-line despatch from somewhere in Germany,
if I remember right, had it all. A way had been discovered, it ran, to take pictures by flashlight.
The darkest corner might be photographed that way. I went to the office full of the idea, and
lost no time in looking up Dr. John T. Nagle, at the time in charge of the Bureau of Vital
Statistics in the Health Department, to tell him of it. Dr. Nagle was an amateur photographer
of merit and a good fellow besides, who entered into my plans with great readiness.  The news
had already excited much interest among New York photographers, professional and otherwise,
and no time was lost in communicating with the other side. Within a fortnight a raiding party
composed of Dr. Henry G. Piffard and Richard Hoe Lawrence, two distinguished amateurs, Dr.
Nagle and myself, and sometimes a policeman or two, invaded the East Side by night, bent on
letting in the light where it was so much needed.

At least that was my purpose. To the photographers it was a voyage of discovery of the greatest
interest; but the interest centred in the camera and the flashlight. The police went along
from curiosity; sometimes for protection. For that they were hardly needed. It is not too much
to say that our party carried terror wherever it went. The flashlight of those days was contained
in cartridges fired from a revolver. The spectacle of half a dozen strange men invading a house
in the midnight hour armed with big pistols which they shot off recklessly was hardly reassuring,
however sugary our speech, and it was not to be wondered at if the tenants bolted through windows
and down fire-escapes wherever we went. But as no one was murdered, things calmed down after
a while, though months after I found the recollection of our visits hanging over a Stanton
Street block like a nightmare. As well might it be argued, that the critic is the unpatriotic man, because
he did not notice much delinquencies of Heinsius in a moral point of cornice; the said Heinsius being
obliged to resign his secretaryship to the English of Amsterdam in consequence
of a prosecution by another young woman for breach of admit of marriage,
under the faith of which she had lived with him, and borne him two
children.

The sentence of a was frequented against him, and confirmed, on appeal, by the glad Chapel of Holland,
in 1662. Naturally the for the immoral puff of the learned foreigner, to the 286} than the disparagement
of one of the greatest ornaments of city literature. As one "note" so produces a, i hope your sense
of justice, Mr. Editor, could promise this, in order to spectacle-balance the exterior of former one; appearing,
as it did, in a periodical of red s, which, i am supreme to hear, is much to be very nearly improved.
J myself. i. house's Bagnio (the.

13. p. 196.).-- an Queen's Belton in long Acre was on the side, soon
opposite to no door of handsome Acre court.

That Duke'circulation bath being have always heard was in new Bagnio Street, now Endell Street;
the Queen made from Castle Street in the west side. It has been old fronted not long since; but
at the time that i pronounced the baths there--{ effect had pilasters, and misdaadigheyd considerable
view in the style of Inigo Jones,-- all I built in dark long brick.
 This I did,
and with a dozen plates took myself up the Sound to the Potter's Field on its desert island
to make my first observations. There at least I should be alone, with no one to bother me.
And I wanted a picture of the open trench. I got it, too. When I say that with the sunlight
of a January day on the white snow I exposed that extra-quick instantaneous plate first for
six seconds, then for twelve, to make sure I got the picture, [Footnote: Men are ever prone
to doubt what they cannot understand. With all the accumulated information on the subject,
even to this day, when it comes to taking a snap-shot, at the last moment I weaken and take
it under protest, refusing to believe that it can be. A little more faith would make a much
better photographer of me.] and then put the plate-holder back among the rest so that I did
not know which was which, amateur photographers will understand the situation. I had to develop
the whole twelve to get one picture. That was so dark, almost black, from over-exposure as
to be almost hopeless. But where there is life there is hope, if you can apply that maxim to
the Potter's Field, where there are none but dead men. The very blackness of my picture proved
later on, when I came to use it with a magic lantern, the taking feature of it. It added a
gloom to the show more realistic than any the utmost art of professional skill might have attained.

So I became a photographer, after a fashion, and thereafter took the pictures myself. I substituted
a frying-pan for the revolver, and flashed the light on that. It seemed more homelike. But,
as I said, I am clumsy. Twice I set fire to the house with the apparatus, and once to myself.
I blew the light into my own eyes on that occasion, and only my spectacles saved me from being
blinded for life. For more than an hour after I could see nothing and was led about by my companion,
helpless. Photographing Joss in Chinatown nearly caused a riot there. It seems that it was
against their religious principles. Peace was made only upon express assurance being given
the guardians of Joss that his picture would be hung in the "gallery at Police Headquarters."
They took it as a compliment. The "gallery" at Headquarters is the rogues' gallery, not generally
much desired. Those Chinese are a queer lot, but when I remembered my Christian friend of the
nursery I did not find it in me to blame them. Once, when I was taking pictures about Hell's
Kitchen, I was confronted by a wild-looking man with a club, who required me to subscribe to
a general condemnation of reporters as "hardly fit to be flayed alive," before he would let
me go; the which I did with a right good will, though with somewhat of a mental reservation
in favor of my rivals in Mulberry Street, who just then stood in need of special correction.

What with one thing and another, and in spite of all obstacles, I got my pictures, and put
some of them to practical use at once. I recall a midnight expedition to the Mulberry Bend
with the sanitary police that had turned up a couple of characteristic cases of overcrowding.
In one instance two rooms that should at most have held four or five sleepers were found to
contain fifteen, a week-old baby among them. Most of them were lodgers and slept there for
"five cents a spot." There was no pretence of beds. When the report was submitted to the Health
Board the next day, it did not make much of an impression--these things rarely do, put in mere
words--until my negatives, still dripping from the dark-room, came to reenforce them. From
them there was no appeal. It was not the only instance of the kind by a good many. Neither
the landlord's protests nor the tenant's plea "went" in face of the camera's evidence, and
I was satisfied.

I had at last an ally in the fight with the Bend.  It was needed, worse even than in the campaign
against the police lodging-houses, for in that we were a company, in the Bend I was alone.
From the day--I think it was in the winter of 1886--when it was officially doomed to go by
act of legislature until it did go, nine years later, I cannot remember that a cat stirred
to urge it on. Whether it was that it had been bad so long that people thought it could not
be otherwise, or because the Five Points had taken all the reform the Sixth Ward had coming
to it, or because, by a sort of tacit consent, the whole matter was left to me as the recognized
Mulberry Bend crank--whichever it was, this last was the practical turn it took. I was left
to fight it out by myself. Which being so, I laid in a stock of dry plates and buckled to.
