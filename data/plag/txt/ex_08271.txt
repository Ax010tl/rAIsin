My father (his youngest son) falling in love with a poor relation, who lived with the old gentleman
in quality of a housekeeper, espoused her privately; and I was the first fruit of that marriage.
During her pregnancy, a dream discomposed my mother so much that her husband, tired with her
importunity, at last consulted a highland seer, whose favourable interpretation he would have
secured beforehand by a bribe, but found him incorruptible. She dreamed she was delivered of
a tennis-ball, which the devil (who, to her great surprise, acted the part of a midwife) struck
so forcibly with a racket that it disappeared in an instant; and she was for some time inconsolable
for the lost of her offspring; when, all on a sudden, she beheld it return with equal violence,
and enter the earth, beneath her feet, whence immediately sprang up a goodly tree covered with
blossoms, the scent of which operated so strongly on her nerves that she awoke. The attentive
sage, after some deliberation, assured my parents, that their firstborn would be a great traveller;
that he would undergo many dangers and difficulties, and at last return to his native land,
where he would flourish in happiness and reputation. How truly this was foretold will appear
in the sequel. It was not long before some officious person informed my grandfather of certain
familiarities that passed between his son and housekeeper which alarmed him so much that, a
few days after, he told my father it was high time for him to think of settling; and that he
had provided a match for him, to which he could in justice have no objections. My father, finding
it would be impossible to conceal his situation much longer, frankly owned what he had done;
and excused himself for not having asked the consent of his father, by saying, he knew it would
have been to no Purpose; and that, had his inclination been known, my grandfather might have
taken such measures as would have effectually put the gratification of it out of his power:
he added, that no exceptions could be taken to his wife's virtue, birth, beauty, and good sense,
and as for fortune, it was beneath his care. The old gentleman, who kept all his passions,
except one, in excellent order, heard him to an end with great temper, and then calmly asked,
how he proposed to maintain himself and spouse? He replied, he could be in no danger of wanting
while his father's tenderness remained, which he and his wife should always cultivate with
the utmost veneration; and he was persuaded his allowance would be suitable to the dignity
and circumstances of his family, and to the provision already made for his brothers and sisters,
who were happily settled under his protection. "Your brothers and sisters," said my grandfather,
"did not think it beneath them to consult me in an affair of such importance as matrimony;
neither, I suppose, would you have omitted that piece of duty, had you not some secret fund
in reserve; to the comforts of which I leave you, with a desire that you will this night seek
out another habitation for yourself and wife, whither, in a short time, I will send you an
account of the ex pens I have been at in your education, with a view of being reimbursed. Sir,
you have made the grand tour--you are a polite gentleman--a very pretty gentleman--I wish you
a great deal of joy, and am your very humble servant."

So saying, he left my father in a situation easily imagined. However, he did not long hesitate;
for, being perfectly well acquainted with his father's disposition, he did not doubt that he
was glad of this pretence to get rid of him; and his resolves being as invariable as the laws
of the Medes and Persians, he know it would be to no purpose to attempt him by prayers and
entreaties; so without any farther application, he betook himself, with his disconsolate bedfellow
to a farm-house, where an old servant of his mother dwelt: there they remained some time in
a situation but ill adapted to the elegance of their desires and tenderness of their love;
which nevertheless my father chose to endure, rather than supplicate an unnatural and inflexible
parent but my mother, foreseeing the inconveniences to which she must have been exposed, had
she been delivered in this place (and her pregnancy was very far advanced), without communicating
her design to her husband, went in disguise to the house of my grandfather, hoping that her
tears and condition would move him to compassion, and reconcile him to an event which was now
irrecoverably past.

your jaw," replied my uncle, "else I shall trim your laced jacket for you. I shall rub you
down with an oaken towel, my boy, I shall." So saying, he sheathed his hanger, and grasped
his cudgel. Meanwhile the people of the house being alarmed, one of my female cousins opened
a window, and asked what was the matter. "The matter!" answered the lieutenant; "no great matter,
young woman; I have business with the old gentleman, and this spark, belike, won't allow me
to come alongside of him," that's all. After a few minutes pause we were admitted, and conducted
to my grandfather's chamber through a lane of my relations, who honoured me with very significant
looks as I passed along. We succeeded him in rising to my feet, and breaking through army of three bows.
He dashed out the grandfather, heatedly pursued by them. Coming to Stream, when we passed it

 He calmly rebuked my uncle for his unmannerly behaviour,
which he said he would excuse on account of his education: he told him he had been very kind
to the boy, whom he had kept at school seven or eight years, although he was informed he made
no progress in his learning but was addicted to all manner of vice, which he rather believed,
because he himself was witness to a barbarous piece of mischief he had committed on the jaws
of his chaplain. But, however, he would see what the lad was fit for, and bind him apprentice
to some honest tradesman or other, provided he would mend his manners, and behave for the future
as became him. That though rather brief brains, his d returned himself in coffee of death, desired by years

 You shall see--you

his relations, we advanced to the bedside, where we found him in his last agonies, supported
by two of his granddaughters, who sat on each side of him, sobbing most piteously, and wiping
away the froth and slaver as it gathered on his lips, which they frequently kissed with a show
of great anguish and affection. My uncle approached him with these words, "What! he's not a-weigh.
How fare ye? how fare ye, old gentleman? Lord have mercy upon your poor sinful soul!" Upon
which, the dying man turned his languid eyes towards us, and Mr. Bowling went on--"Here's poor

 In the meantime, orders

uncle would not suffer me to accept of it, until I should be assured whether or no I had reason
to honour his memory so far.
