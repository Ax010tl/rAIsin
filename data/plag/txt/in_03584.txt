Italian art existed in these small beginnings, in the gorgeous but quaintly formal or fantastic
devices of illuminated missals, and in the stiff spasmodic efforts of here and there an artist
spirit such as the old Florentine Cimabue's, when a great man heralded a great epoch. But first
I should like to mention the means by which art then worked. Painting on board and on plastered
walls, the second styled painting in fresco, preceded painting on canvas. Colours were mixed
with water or with size, egg, or fig-juice--the latter practices termed tempera (in English
in distemper) before oil was used to mix colours. But painters did not confine themselves then
to painting with pencil or brush, else they might have attained technical excellence sooner.
It has been well said that the poems of the middle ages were written in stone; so the earlier
painters painted in stone, in that mosaic work which one of them called--referring to its durability--'painting
for eternity;' and in metals. 

The church of San Pedro, which is also in the Gothic style, pure and in the same time or perhaps
above, located in downtown Lyon, is still a more vigorous type of their nakedness their sorrow
and their overall proportions. The Greek knowledge of anatomy was well-nigh lost, so
that drawing was incorrect and form bad. The idea of showing degrees of distance, and the management
of light and shade, were feebly developed. Even the fore-shortening of figures was so difficult
to the old Italian painters that they could not carry it into the extremities, and men and
women seem as though standing on the points of their toes. Landscape-painting did not exist
farther than that a rock or a bush, or a few blue lines, with fishes out of proportion prominently
interposed, indicated, as on the old stage, that a desert, a forest, or a sea, was to play
its part in the story of the picture. So also portrait-painting was not thought of, unless
it occurred in the likeness of a great man belonging to the time and place of the painter,
who was the donor of some picture to chapel or monastery, or of the painter himself, alike
introduced into sacred groups and scenes; for pictures were uniformly of a religious character,
until a little later, when they merged into allegorical representations, just as one remembers
that miracle plays passed into moral plays before ordinary human life was reproduced. Until
this period, what we call dramatic expression in making a striking situation, or even in bringing
the look of joy or sorrow, pleasure or pain, into a face, had hardly been attained.

Perhaps you will ask, what merit had the old paintings of the middle ages to compensate for
so many great disadvantages and incongruities? Certainly before the time I have reached, they
have, with rare exceptions, little merit, save that fascination of pathos, half-comic, half-tragic,
which belongs to the struggling dawn of all great endeavours, and especially of all endeavours
in art. But just at this epoch, art, in one man, took a great stride, began, as I shall try
to show, to exert an influence so true, deep, and high that it extends, in the noblest forms,
to the present day, and much more than compensates to the thoughtful and poetic for a protracted
train of technical blunders and deficiencies.

Giotto, known also as Magister Joctus, was born in 1276 near Florence. I dare say many have
heard one legend of him, and I mean to tell the legends of the painters, because even when
they are most doubtful they give the most striking indications of the times and the light in
which painters and their paintings were regarded by the world of artists, and by the world
at large; but so far as I have heard this legend of Giotto has not been disproven. The only
objection which can be urged against it, is that it is found preserved in various countries,
of very different individuals--a crowning objection also to the legend of William Tell. Giotto
was a shepherd boy keeping his father's sheep and amusing himself by drawing with chalk on
a stone the favourites of the flock, when his drawings attracted the attention of a traveller
passing from the heights into the valley. This traveller was the well-born and highly-esteemed
painter Cimabue, who was so delighted with the little lad's rough outlines, that getting the
consent of Giotto's father, Cimabue adopted the boy, carried him off to the city of Florence,
introduced him to his studio, and so far as man could supplement the work of God, made a painter
of the youthful genius. I may add here a later legend of Giotto. Pope Boniface VIII, requested
specimens of skill from various artists with the view to the appointment of a painter to decorate
St Peter's. Giotto, either in impatient disdain, or to show a careless triumph of skill, with
one flourish of his hand, without the aid of compass, executed a perfect circle in red chalk,
and sent the circle as his contribution to the specimens required by the Pope. The audacious
specimen was accepted as the most conclusive, Giotto was chosen as the Pope's painter for the
occasion, and from the incident arose the Italian proverb 'round as the o of Giotto.' Giotto
was the friend of Dante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio, especially of Dante, to whom the grandeur
of some of the painter's designs has been vaguely enough attributed. The poet of the 'Inferno'
wrote of his friend:

                   '......... Cimabue thought
    To lord it over painting's field; and now
    The cry is Giotto's, and his name eclipsed.'

Petrarch bequeathed in his will a Madonna by Giotto and mentioned it as a rare treasure of
art. Boccaccio wrote a merry anecdote of his comrade the painter's wit, in the course of which
he referred with notable plain-speaking to Giotto's 'flat currish' plainness of face.

The impression handed down of Giotto's character is that of an independent, high-spirited man,
full of invention, full of imagination, and also, by a precious combination, full of shrewdness
and common sense; a man genial, given to repartee, and at the same time not deficient in the
tact which deprives repartee of its sting. While he was working to King Robert of Naples, the
king, who was watching the painter on a very hot day, said, with a shrug, 'If I were you, Giotto,
I would leave off work and rest myself this fine day, 'And so would I, sire, if I were you,'
replied the wag.

I need scarcely add that Giotto was a man highly esteemed and very prosperous in his day; one
account reports him as the head and the father of four sons and four daughters. I have purposely
written first of the fame, the reputed character, and the circumstances of Giotto before I
proceed to his work. This great work was, in brief, to breathe into painting the living soul
which had till then--in mediæval times--been largely absent. Giotto went to Nature for his
inspiration, and not content with the immense innovation of superseding by the actual representation
of men and women in outline, tint, and attitude, the rigid traditions of his predecessors,
he put men's passions in their faces--the melancholy looked sad, the gay glad. This result,
to us so simple, filled Giotto's lively countrymen, who had seldom seen it, with astonishment
and delight. They cried out as at a marvel when he made the commonest deed even coarsely lifelike,
as in the case of a sailor in a boat, who turned round with his hand before his face and spat
into the sea; and when he illustrated the deed with the corresponding expression, as in the
thrill of eagerness that perceptibly pervaded the whole figure of a thirsty man who stooped
down to drink. But Giotto was no mere realist though he was a great realist; he was also in
the highest light an idealist. His sense of harmony and beauty was true and noble; he rose
above the real into 'the things unseen and eternal,' of which the real is but a rough manifestation.
He was the first to paint a crucifixion robbed of the horrible triumph of physical power, and
of the agony which is at its bidding, and invested with the divinity of awe and love.

Giotto's work did not end with himself; he was the founder of the earliest worthy school of
Italian art, so worthy in this very glorious idealism, that, as I have already said, the men
whose praise is most to be coveted, have learned to turn back to Giotto and his immediate successors,
and, forgetting and forgiving all their ignorance, crudeness, quaintness, to dwell never wearied,
and extol without measure these oldest masters' dignity of spirit, the earnestness of their
originality, the solemnity and heedfulness of their labour. It would seem as if skill and polish,
with the amount of attention which they appropriate, with their elevation of manner over matter,
and thence their lowered standard, are apt to rob from or blur in men these highest qualifications
of genius, for it is true that judges miss even in the Lionardo, Michael Angelo, and Raphael
of a later and much more accomplished generation, and, to a far greater extent, in the Rubens
of another and still later day, the perfect simplicity, the unalloyed fervour, the purity of
tenderness in Giotto, Orcagna, Fra Angelico, and in their Flemish brethren, the Van Eycks and
Mabuse. They lack any vegetation, because the winds of the Alps ravage the land, and
scarcely visible, away in distance, and some giant ruins of feudal castles dominate the highest eminences
as leaning over the abyss and climbed to small populations The mountains rise to receive protection
of these castles, and each afar a vast nest of eagles attached to
the tops of the rocks.

In between those two orographic formations look so different, it takes
the opulent valley, crossed by small tributaries of the Rhone, including
the Durance, which brings the waters of the poetic Provence.

Queen wherever the most careful cultivation of the valley making a kind of endless garden. It is
now many mulberry dwarf, which offer their food to worm silk manufacturer, and make a nice
contrast to his dark green and vigorous, arranged in intersecting streets in all directions, with
vivid green and the almond yellow or nearly intermediaries vineyards begin to open their first
leaves. Then, as you move away from Lyon, is looking to reduce the number of mulberry trees
gradually replaced in the beautiful olive groves of Provence by the color gray, as gray ink, melancholy
in the extreme, stands out like an immense shroud on movent green carpet of wheat planted
in the middle of the wide streets of olive trees. First, his allegories
in the great church, in honour of St Francis, at Assisi, in relation to which, writing of its
German architect, an author says: 'He built boldly against the mountain, piling one church
upon another; the upper vast, lofty, and admitting through its broad windows the bright rays
of the sun: the lower as if in the bowels of the earth--low, solemn, and almost shutting out
the light of day. Around the lofty edifice grew the convent, a vast building, resting upon
a long line of arches clinging to the hill-sides. As the evening draws nigh, casting its deep
shadows across the valley, the traveller beneath gazes upwards with feelings of wonder and
delight at this graceful arcade supporting the massy convent; the ancient towers and walls
of the silent town gathering around, and the purple rocks rising high above--all still glowing
in the lingering sunbeams--a scene scarcely to be surpassed in any clime for its sublime beauty.'
The upper church contains frescoes wonderfully fresh, by Cimabue, of Scriptural subjects, and
frescoes of scenes from the life vowed to poverty of St Francis. In the lower church, over
the tomb of St Francis, are the four masterpieces with which we have to do. These are the three
vows of the order figuratively represented. Mark the fitness and grandeur of two of the figures,
the suggestion of which has been attributed to Dante, the woman Chastity seated beyond assault
in her rocky fortress, and Obedience bowing the neck to curb and yoke. The fourth fresco pictures
the saint who died, 'covered by another's cloak cast over his wasted body eaten with sores,'
enthroned and glorified amidst the host of Heaven.

I have chosen the second example of the art of Giotto because you may with comparative ease
see it for yourselves. It is in the National Gallery, London, having belonged to the collection
of the late Samuel Rogers. It is a fragment of an old fresco which had been part of a series
illustrating the life of John the Baptist in the church of the Carmine, Florence, a church
which was destroyed by fire in 1771. The fragment in the National Gallery has two fine heads
of apostles bending sorrowfully over the body of St John. Though it is not necessary to do
it, in strict justice, because good work rises superior to all accidents of comparison as well
as accidents of circumstance, one must remember in regarding this, the stilted and frozen figures
and faces, which, before Giotto broke their bonds and inspired them, had professed to tell
the Bible's stories.

The third instance I have chosen to quote is Giotto's portrait of Dante which was so strangely
lost for many years. The portrait occurs in a painting, the first recorded performance of Giotto's,
in which he was said to have introduced the likeness of many of his contemporaries, on the
wall of the Palazzo dell' Podestà or Council Chamber of Florence. During the banishment of
Dante the wall was plastered or white-washed over, through the influence of his enemies, and
though believed to exist, the picture was hidden down to 1840, when, after various futile efforts
to recover it, the figures were again brought to light.

This portrait of Dante is altogether removed from the later portraits of the indignant and
weary man, of whom the Italian market-women said that he had been in Hell as well as in exile.
Giotto's Dante on the walls of the Council Chamber is a noble young man of thirty, full of
ambitious hope and early distinction. The face is slightly pointed, with broad forehead, hazel
eyes, straight brows and nose, mouth and chin a little projecting. The close cloak or vest
with sleeves, and cap in folds hanging down on the shoulder, the hand holding the triple fruit,
in prognostication of the harvest of virtue and renown which was to be so bitter as well as
so glorious, are all in keeping and have a majesty of their own. The picture is probably known
by engravings to many of my readers.

The last example of Giotto's, is the one which of all his works is most potent and patent in
its beauty, and has struck, and, in so far as we can tell, will for ages strike, with its greatness
multitudes of widely different degrees of cultivation whose intellectual capacity is as far
apart as their critical faculty. I mean the matchless Campanile or bell-tower 'towering over
the Dome of Brunelleschi' at Florence, formed of coloured marbles--for which Giotto framed
the designs, and even executed with his own hands the models for the sculpture. With this lovely
sight Dean Alford's description is more in keeping than the prosaic saying of Charles V., that
'the Campanile ought to be kept under glass.' Dean Alford's enthusiasm thus expresses itself:

     'A mass of varied light written on the cloudless sky of
     unfathomed blue; varied but blended, as never in any other
     building that we had seen; the warm yellow of the lighter marbles
     separated but not disunited by the ever-recurring bands of dark;
     or glowing into red where the kisses of the sun had been hottest;
     or fading again into white where the shadows mostly haunted, or
     where the renovating hand had been waging conflict with decay.'

It is known that Giotto, together with his friend Dante, died before this--Giotto's last great
work--was finally constructed by Giotto's pupil, Taddeo Gaddi, and that therefore neither of
the friends could have really looked on 'Giotto's Tower,' though Italian Ciceroni point out,
and strangers love to contemplate, the very stone on which 'Grim Dante' sat and gazed with
admiration in the calm light of evening on the enduring memorial of the painter.

Giotto died in the year 1336 or 1337, his biographer adds, 'no less a good Christian than an
excellent painter,' and in token of his faith he painted one crucifixion in which he introduced
his own figure 'kneeling in an attitude of deep devotion and contrition at the foot of the
Cross.' The good taste of such an act has been questioned, so has been the practice which painted
the Virgin Mother now as a brown Italian, now as a red and white Fleming, and again as a flaxen-haired
German or as a swarthy Spaniard, and draped her and all the minor figures in the grandest drama
the world ever saw--as well as the characters in older Scripture histories, in the Florentine,
Venetian, and Antwerp fashions of the day. The defence of the practice is, that the Bible is
for universal time, that its Virgin Mother, its apostles and saints, were types of other mothers
and of other heroes running down the stream of history; that even the one central and holy
figure, if He may be represented at all, as the Divine brother of all humanity, may be clad
not inaptly in the garments of all. It appears to me that there is reason in this answer, and
that viewed in its light the criticism which constantly demands historic fidelity is both carping
and narrow. I do not mean, however, to underrate historic accuracy in itself, or to depreciate
that longing for completeness in every particular, which drives our modern painters to the
East to study patiently for months the aspects of nature under its Oriental climate, with its
peculiar people and animals, its ancient costumes and architecture.

Giotto was buried with suitable honours by a city which, like the rest of the nation, has magnified
its painters amongst its great men, in the church of Santa Maria del Fiore, where his master
Cimabue had been buried. Lorenzo de' Medici afterwards placed over Giotto's tomb his effigy
in marble.

In chronicling ancient art I must here diverge a little. I have already mentioned how closely
painting was in the beginning allied with working in metals as well as with sculpture and architecture.
It is thus necessary to write of a magnificent work in metal, the study and admiration of generations
of painters, begun in the life of Giotto, and completed in two divisions, extending over a
period of nearly a hundred years. We shall proceed to deal with the first division, and recur
to the second a little later.

The old Italian cities. They were then the great merchant cities of the world, more or less
republican in their constitution. They stood to the citizens, who rarely left their walls,
at once as peculiar possessions and as native countries rather than as cities alone, while
they excited all the patriotism, pride, and love that were elsewhere expended on a whole country--which
after all was held as belonging largely to its king and nobles. 

In one of the neighboring mountains the ancient fortress of Nuestra SeÃ±ora de la Guardia is found
overlooking the city, next to the chapel of the same name, in which the virgen enjoys the highest
honor on the part of the sailors. It was a merchant
guild which thought happily of giving to Florence the bronze gates to the baptistery of San
Giovanni or St John the Baptist, attached to the Cathedral. After some competition the gates
were intrusted to Andrea Pisano, one of a great group of painters, sculptors, and architects
linked together and named, as so often happened in Italy, for their place of birth, Pisa. Andrea
executed a series of beautiful reliefs from the life of John the Baptist, which were cast in
1330, gilt, and placed in the centre door-way. I shall leave the rest of the gates, still more
exquisitely wrought, till their proper time, only observing that the Pisani group of carvers
and founders are supposed to have attained their extraordinary superiority in skill and grace,
even over such a painter as Giotto, in consequence of one of them, Nicola Pisano, having given
his attention to the study of some ancient Greek sarcophagi preserved at Pisa.

Passing for a while from the gates of St John of Florence, we come back to painting and a painter,
and with them to another monument--in itself very noble and curious in its mouldering age,
of the old Italians' love to their cities. Andrea Orcagna, otherwise known as Andrea di Cione,
one of a brotherhood of painters, was born in Florence about 1315. His greatest works are in
the Campo Santa of Pisa.

This wonderful 'holy field' is a grand legacy, so far as dilapidation, alas, will let it be,
of the old painters. Originally a place of burial, though no longer used as such, it is enclosed
by high walls and an arcade, something like the cloisters of a cathedral or college running
round, and having on the north and east sides chapels where masses for the dead were celebrated.
The space in the centre was filled with earth brought from the Holy Land by the merchant ships
of Pisa. It is covered with turf, having tall cypress-trees at the corners, and a little cross
in the centre. The arcade is pierced with sixty-two windows, and contains on its marble pavement
hundreds of monuments--among them the Greek sarcophagi studied by Nicola Pisano. But the great
distinction of the Campo Santa (of which there are many photographs) are the walls opposite
the windows of the arcade painted with Scriptural subjects by artists of the fourteenth and
fifteenth centuries, for the decoration of the walls was continued at intervals, during two
hundred years. The havoc wrought by time and damp has been terrible; not only are the pictures
faded and discoloured, but of the earliest only mutilated fragments, 'here an arm and there
a head,' remain. Giotto's illustrations of the book of Job have thus perished. Still Orcagna's
work has partially escaped, and left us indications of what it was in his and its youth, when
Michael Angelo and Raphael did not disdain to borrow from it in design and arrangement. Dean
Alford has thus described Orcagna's mournful, thoughtful 'Triumph of Death:'

'The picture is one of crowded action, and contains very many personages. The action may be
supposed to begin in the lower corner on the right hand. There we see what appears to be a
wedding-party seated in festivity under a grove of orange-trees laden with fruit. Over two
of them a pair entertaining them with merry strains. But close to them on the left comes swooping
down on bats' wings, and armed with the inevitable scythe, the genius of Death. Her wild hair
streams in the wind, her bosom is invulnerable, being closed in a trellised armour of steel.
Beneath her, on the ground, are a heap of corpses, shown by their attire to be the great and
wealthy of the world. Three winged figures, two fiends and one angel, are drawing souls, in
the form of children, out of the mouths of three of these corpses. Above, the air is full of
flying spirits, angels and demons: the former beautiful and saintly, the latter hideous and
bestial. Some are dragging, or bearing upwards, human souls: others are on their way to fetch
them from the heaps of dead: others, again, are flying about apparently without aim. Further
yet to the left, a company of wretched ones, lame and in rags, are invoking Death with outstretched
arms to come to their relief; but she sweeps by and heeds them not.

'Dividing one half of the picture from the other, is a high range of rocks, terminating in
a fiery mountain, into which the demons are casting the unhappy souls which they have carried
off. Beyond that seems to be a repetition of the same lesson respecting Death in another form. Sometimes, one vote, made ââthe solemn moments of danger, in the
solitude of the ocean, will meet on the barren mountains that being indifferent to everything, lattice
over the storm, called a sailor.

The wonderful power of faith! Momentum is low, and the man is liable to make prodigious efforts and
sacrifices of the most sublime. If faith acts differently on the mind
and heart, it ceases to be a universal talisman. Above, on a rising ground, an aged monk (it is said, Saint Macarius)
is holding a scroll, and pointing out to passengers the moral of the sight which meets them.
The path winds up a hill crowned with a church, and by its side at various points are hermits
sitting in calm security, or following peaceful occupations. One of them is milking a doe;
another is reading; a third is calmly contemplating from a distance the valley of Death. About
them are various animals and birds. The idea evidently intended to be conveyed is that deliverance
from the fear of death is to be found not in gaiety and dissipation, but in contemplation and
communion with God.

'Such is the wonderful fresco, and the execution is as wonderful as the conception. Belonging
as the painter did to a rude and early period of art, he yet had the power of endowing his
figures with both majesty and tenderness of expression.'

The Last Judgment is no less solemn and sad, with hope tempering its sadness. Mrs Jameson's
note of it is: 'Above, in the centre, Christ and the Virgin are throned in separate glories.
He turns to the left, towards the condemned, while he uncovers the wound in his side, and raises
his right arm with a menacing gesture, his countenance full of majestic wrath. The Virgin,
on the right of her Son, is the picture of heavenly mercy, and, as if terrified at the words
of eternal condemnation, she turns away. On either side are ranged the Prophets of the Old
Testament, the Apostles and other saints, severe, solemn, dignified figures. Angels, holding
the instruments of the Passion, hover over Christ and the Virgin; under them is a group of
archangels. The archangel Michael stands in the midst holding a scroll in each hand; immediately
before him another archangel, supposed to represent Raphael, the guardian angel of humanity,
cowers down, shuddering, while two others sound the awful trumpets of doom. Lower down is the
earth where men are seen rising from their graves; armed angels direct them to the right and
left. Here is seen King Solomon, who, whilst he rises, seems doubtful to which side he should
turn; here a hypocritical monk, whom an angel draws back by the hair from the host of the youth
in a gay and rich costume, whom another angel leads away to Paradise. There is wonderful and
even terrible power of expression in some of the heads; and it is said that among them are
many portraits of contemporaries, but unfortunately no circumstantial traditions as to particular
figures have reached us.'
