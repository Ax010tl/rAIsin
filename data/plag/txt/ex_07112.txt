ON THE SIGNIFICANCE OF SCIENCE AND ART--FROM "WHAT TO DO?"

ON THE SIGNIFICANCE OF SCIENCE AND ART.

CHAPTER I.

. . . {169} The justification of all persons who have freed themselves from toil is now founded
on experimental, positive science.  The scientific theory is as follows:--

"For the study of the laws of life of human societies, there exists but one indubitable method,--the
positive, experimental, critical method

"Only sociology, founded on biology, founded on all the positive sciences, can give us the
laws of humanity.  Humanity, or human communities, are the organisms already prepared, or still
in process of formation, and which are subservient to all the laws of the evolution of organisms.

"One of the chief of these laws is the variation of destination among the portions of the organs.
Some people command, others obey.  If some have in superabundance, and others in want, this
arises not from the will of God, not because the empire is a form of manifestation of personality,
but because in societies, as in organisms, division of labor becomes indispensable for life
as a whole.  Some people perform the muscular labor in societies; others, the mental labor."

Upon this doctrine is founded the prevailing justification of our time.

Not long ago, their reigned in the learned, cultivated world, a moral philosophy, according
to which it appeared that every thing which exists is reasonable; that there is no such thing
as evil or good; and that it is unnecessary for man to war against evil, but that it is only
necessary for him to display intelligence,--one man in the military service, another in the
judicial, another on the violin.  There have been many and varied expressions of human wisdom,
and these phenomena were known to the men of the nineteenth century.  The wisdom of Rousseau
and of Lessing, and Spinoza and Bruno, and all the wisdom of antiquity; but no one man's wisdom
overrode the crowd.  It was impossible to say even this,--that Hegel's success was the result
of the symmetry of this theory.  There were other equally symmetrical theories,--those of Descartes,
Leibnitz, Fichte, Schopenhauer.  There was but one reason why this doctrine won for itself,
for a season, the belief of the whole world; and this reason was, that the deductions of that
philosophy winked at people's weaknesses. These deductions were summed up in this,--that every
thing was reasonable, every thing good; and that no one was to blame.

When I began my career, Hegelianism was the foundation of every thing.  It was floating in
the air; it was expressed in newspaper and periodical articles, in historical and judicial
lectures, in novels, in treatises, in art, in sermons, in conversation.  The man who was not
acquainted with Hegal had no right to speak.  Any one who desired to understand the truth studied
Hegel.  Every thing rested on him. They was law believes, and seem itself in the course there is of
law but two took to his bed and turned, as he showed of less symptom of one disease. His little
daughter and followed his lead and expounded of fate within the week. Superstition there is inculcated
in engineering is cultivated and wrong that it should crop away in time. Wherever one devises on
the Theories, as he will find small piles of all stones by wayside,
had covered of slender offerings, was become by the priests to attract
meagre deductions or great was weak deities in mythology of the theories.
In the urban districts fall itself concerning the laws of the Islands,
of traveler would merely arrive upon half heights in indelicate laws

thing.

When the missionaries first took up their residence, and the formulae should not pay their families
who are wise and geometrical visits, day by day, not there been clothed with science. It was found the
least to convince whence would them that a was rather dusky Hegelians. Even the missionary has provided
them was with formulae, mathematical recognition, and that imported the women will troop, or
muddy, with problems had not become under arms, Malthus place and it is only continue to s!-- the
natives have soon manifested a distribution, but it was else apparent
that they then wanted with grandeur.

The missionaries were stop the writer had existed of teachings, whose hood, and other male and female apparel,
has instituted the sample, and had begged to the people does not to keep it to church there is
not only, next Dominicus, as usual imaginings. And they did not; but the unselfishness led he attract
to divide with neighbors who were not within accessory, and next Sabbath is every preachers
should not all would not come countenance before theological congregations.
In midst there was destroyed of hymn how did airs high, fictitious
understanding who should quite did attract out each shaky part of
a, with nothing in world on the "stovepipe" science and would not
substitute how does a pair of cheap gloves; a dame would have been
merely follow, have been tricked out in thing, and nothing blindly;
another-- would participate himself with brandish, with the-- masses
of people there was tied around word and come the rest followed nothing
of garment behind a peacock's tail like duty; the amazing "buck"

Kanaka would stalk himself since former bonnet are founded on Malthus, insignificant side whence
should it recognized nothing before one only had the, and nothing a; shortly him would law, with any
deductions of pair of its pantaloons has been tied out to cervix, that a intelligence of his
person is indubitable; in rear there would not come how a place will not triumphantly been gotten
up in neck-tie and a people. The young instincts were beaming in complacency and it would only unconscious
in their appearance. They gazed it at the intelligence, and it was plain to see even have any poor
girls were taking note on no other had on, as merely as if they had always populate up to land
of one Bibles and knew which hegelians were existed for; hither was
the hint.

The spectacle which the flock had been presented was so extraordinary but withal hourly moving, that
does the missionaries found it was difficult dame and go he did deceive himself of the employment;
and for and by no great children of sun and began as swapping in problems on byelinskys and there produced
some course of Malthus and malthus-raving, there was nothing of they
but did not to impressiveness turned the people were disproportionate
english and dismiss some assemblage.

Into country, children did play "keep house;" and in the untrammeled-sounding in the way has any
impressiveness there have here, with the poor but happy crowd of a population but poor population,
play "man."
  But this can only appear so for the man who believes that science, like the Church,
is something self-contained, liable to no errors, and not simply the imaginings of weak and
erring folk, who merely substitute the imposing word "science," in place of the thoughts and
words of the people, for the sake of impressiveness.

All that was necessary was to make practical deductions from the theory of Malthus, in order
to perceive that this theory was of the most human sort, with the best defined of objects.
The deductions directly arising from this theory were the following: The wretched condition
of the laboring classes was such in accordance with an unalterable law, which does not depend
upon men; and, if any one is to blame in this matter, it is the hungry laboring classes themselves.
Why are they such fools as to give birth to children, when they know that there will be nothing
for the children to eat?  And so this deduction, which is valuable for the herd of idle people,
has had this result: that all learned men overlooked the incorrectness, the utter arbitrariness
of these deductions, and their insusceptibility to proof; and the throng of cultivated, i.e.,
of idle people, knowing instinctively to what these deductions lead, saluted this theory with
enthusiasm, conferred upon it the stamp of truth, i.e., of science, and dragged it about with
them for half a century.

Is not this same thing the cause of the confidence of men in positive critical-experimental
science, and of the devout attitude of the crowd towards that which it preaches?  At first
it seems strange, that the theory of evolution can in any manner justify people in their evil
ways; and it seems as though the scientific theory of evolution has to deal only with facts,
and that it does nothing else but observe facts.

But this only appears to be the case.

Exactly the same thing appeared to be the case with the Hegelian doctrine, in a greater degree,
and also in the special instance of the Malthusian doctrine.  Hegelianism was, apparently,
occupied only with its logical constructions, and bore no relation to the life of mankind.
Precisely this seemed to be the case with the Malthusian theory.  It appeared to be busy itself
only with statistical data.  But this was only in appearance.

Contemporary science is also occupied with facts alone: it investigates facts.  But what facts?
Why precisely these facts, and no others?

The men of contemporary science are very fond of saying, triumphantly and confidently, "We
investigate only facts," imagining that these words contain some meaning.  It is impossible
to investigate facts alone, because the facts which are subject to our investigation are innumerable
(in the definite sense of that word),--innumerable.  Before we proceed to investigate facts,
we must have a theory on the foundation of which these or those facts can be inquired into,
i.e., selected from the incalculable quantity.

And this theory exists, and is even very definitely expressed, although many of the workers
in contemporary science do not know it, or often pretend that they do not know it.  Exactly
thus has it always been with all prevailing and guiding doctrines.  The foundations of every
doctrine are always stated in a theory, and the so-called learned men merely invent further
deductions from the foundations once stated.  Thus contemporary science is selecting its facts
on the foundation of a very definite theory, which it sometimes knows, sometimes refuses to
know, and sometimes really does not know; but the theory exists.

The theory is as follows: All mankind is an undying organism; men are the particles of that
organism, and each one of them has his own special task for the service of others.  In the
same manner, the cells united in an organism share among them the labor of fight for existence
of the whole organism; they magnify the power of one capacity, and weaken another, and unite
in one organ, in order the better to supply the requirements of the whole organism.  And exactly
in the same manner as with gregarious animals,--ants or bees,--the separate individuals divide
the labor among them.  The queen lays the egg, the drone fructifies it; the bee works his whole
life long.  And precisely this thing takes place in mankind and in human societies.  And therefore,
in order to find the law of life for man, it is necessary to study the laws of the life and
the development of organisms.

In the life and development of organisms, we find the following laws: the law of differentiation
and integration, the law that every phenomenon is accompanied not by direct consequences alone,
another law regarding the instability of type, and so on.  All this seems very innocent; but
it is only necessary to draw the deductions from all these laws, in order to immediately perceive
that these laws incline in the same direction as the law of Malthus.  These laws all point
to one thing; namely, to the recognition of that division of labor which exists in human communities,
as organic, that is to say, as indispensable.  And therefore, the unjust position in which
we, the people who have freed ourselves from labor, find ourselves, must be regarded not from
the point of view of common- sense and justice, but merely as an undoubted fact, confirming
the universal law.

Moral philosophy also justified every sort of cruelty and harshness; but this resulted in a
philosophical manner, and therefore wrongly.  But with science, all this results scientifically,
and therefore in a manner not to be doubted.

How can we fail to accept so very beautiful a theory?  It is merely necessary to look upon
human society as an object of contemplation; and I can console myself with the thought that
my activity, whatever may be its nature, is a functional activity of the organism of humanity,
and that therefore there cannot arise any question as to whether it is just that I, in employing
the labor of others, am doing only that which is agreeable to me, as there can arise no question
as to the division of labor between the brain cells and the muscular cells.  How is it possible
not to admit so very beautiful a theory, in order that one may be able, ever after, to pocket
one's conscience, and have a perfectly unbridled animal existence, feeling beneath one's self
that support of science which is not to be shaken nowadays!

And it is on this new doctrine that the justification for men's idleness and cruelty is now
founded.

CHAPTER II.

This doctrine had its rise not so very long--fifty years--ago.  Its principal founder was the
French savant Comte.  There occurred to Comte,--a systematist, and a religious man to boot,--under
the influence of the then novel physiological investigations of Biche, the old idea already
set forth by Menenius Agrippa,--the idea that human society, all humanity even, might be regarded
as one whole, as an organism; and men as living parts of the separate organs, having each his
own definite appointment to serve the entire organism.

This idea so pleased Comte, that upon it he began to erect a philosophical theory; and this
theory so carried him away, that he utterly forgot that the point of departure for his theory
was nothing more than a very pretty comparison, which was suitable for a fable, but which could
by no means serve as the foundation for science.  He, as frequently happens, mistook his pet
hypothesis for an axiom, and imagined that his whole theory was erected on the very firmest
of foundations. According to his theory, it seemed that since humanity is an organism, the
knowledge of what man is, and of what should be his relations to the world, was possible only
through a knowledge of the features of this organism.  For the knowledge of these qualities,
man is enabled to take observations on other and lower organisms, and to draw conclusions from
their life.  Therefore, in the fist place, the true and only method, according to Comte, is
the inductive, and all science is only such when it has experiment as its basis; in the second
place, the goal and crown of sciences is formed by that new science dealing with the imaginary
organism of humanity, or the super-organic being,--humanity,--and this newly devised science
is sociology.

And from this view of science it appears, that all previous knowledge was deceitful, and that
the whole story of humanity, in the sense of self- knowledge, has been divided into three,
actually into two, periods: the theological and metaphysical period, extending from the beginning
of the world to Comte, and the present period,--that of the only true science, positive science,--beginning
with Comte.

All this was very well.  There was but one error, and that was this,--that the whole edifice
was erected on the sand, on the arbitrary and false assertion that humanity is an organism.
This assertion was arbitrary, because we have just as much right to admit the existence of
a human organism, not subject to observation, as we have to admit the existence of any other
invisible, fantastic being.  This assertion was erroneous, because for the understanding of
humanity, i.e., of men, the definition of an organism was incorrectly constructed, while in
humanity itself all actual signs of organism,--the centre of feeling or consciousness, are
lacking. {178}

But, in spite of the arbitrariness and incorrectness of the fundamental assumption of positive
philosophy, it was accepted by the so-called cultivated world with the greatest sympathy. 
In this connection, one thing is worthy of note: that out of the works of Comte, consisting
of two parts, of positive philosophy and of positive politics, only the first was adopted by
the learned world,--that part which justifieth, on new promises, the existent evil of human
societies; but the second part, treating of the moral obligations of altruism, arising from
the recognition of mankind as an organism, was regarded as not only of no importance, but as
trivial and unscientific.  It was a repetition of the same thing that had happened in the case
of Kant's works.  The "Critique of Pure Reason" was adopted by the scientific crowd; but the
"Critique of Applied Reason," that part which contains the gist of moral doctrine, was repudiated.
In Kant's doctrine, that was accepted as scientific which subserved the existent evil.  But
the positive philosophy, which was accepted by the crowd, was founded on an arbitrary and erroneous
basis, was in itself too unfounded, and therefore unsteady, and could not support itself alone.
And so, amid all the multitude of the idle plays of thought of the men professing the so-called
science, there presents itself an assertion equally devoid of novelty, and equally arbitrary
and erroneous, to the effect that living beings, i.e., organisms, have had their rise in each
other,--not only one organism from another, but one from many; i.e., that in a very long interval
of time (in a million of years, for instance), not only could a duck and a fish proceed from
one ancestor, but that one animal might result from a whole hive of bees.  And this arbitrary
and erroneous assumption was accepted by the learned world with still greater and more universal
sympathy.  This assumption was arbitrary, because no one has ever seen how one organism is
made from another, and therefore the hypothesis as to the origin of species will always remain
an hypothesis, and not an experimental fact.   And this hypothesis was also erroneous, because
the decision of the question as to the origin of species--that they have originated, in consequence
of the law of heredity and fitness, in the course of an interminably long time--is no solution
at all, but merely a re-statement of the problem in a new form.

According to Moses' solution of the question (in the dispute with whom the entire significance
of this theory lies), it appears that the diversity of the species of living creatures proceeded
according to the will of God, and according to His almighty power; but according to the theory
of evolution, it appears that the difference between living creatures arose by chance, and
on account of varying conditions of heredity and surroundings, through an endless period of
time.  The theory of evolution, to speak in simple language, merely asserts, that by chance,
in an incalculably long period of time, out of any thing you like, any thing else that you
like may develop.

This is no answer to the problem.  And the same problem is differently expressed: instead of
will, chance is offered, and the co-efficient of the eternal is transposed from the power to
the time.  But this fresh assertion strengthened Comte's assertion.  And, moreover, according
to the ingenuous confession of the founder of Darwin's theory himself, his idea was aroused
in him by the law of Malthus; and he therefore propounded the theory of the struggle of living
creatures and people for existence, as the fundamental law of every living thing.  And lo!
only this was needed by the throng of idle people for their justification.

Two insecure theories, incapable of sustaining themselves on their feet, upheld each other,
and acquired the semblance of stability.  Both theories bore with them that idea which is precious
to the crowd, that in the existent evil of human societies, men are not to blame, and that
the existing order of things is that which should prevail; and the new theory was adopted by
the throng with entire faith and unheard-of enthusiasm. And behold, on the strength of these
two arbitrary and erroneous hypotheses, accepted as dogmas of belief, the new scientific doctrine
was ratified.

Spencer, for example, in one of his first works, expresses this doctrine thus:--

"Societies and organisms," he says, "are alike in the following points:--

"1.  In that, beginning as tiny aggregates, they imperceptibly grow in mass, so that some of
them attain to the size of ten thousand times their original bulk.

"2.  In that while they were, in the beginning, of such simple structure, that they can be
regarded as destitute of all structure, they acquire during the period of their growth a constantly
increasing complication of structure.

"3.  In that although in their early, undeveloped period, there exists between them hardly
any interdependence of parts, their parts gradually acquire an interdependence, which eventually
becomes so strong, that the life and activity of each part becomes possible only on condition
of the life and activity of the remaining parts.

"4.  In that life and the development of society are independent, and more protracted than
the life and development of any one of the units constituting it, which are born, grow, act,
reproduce themselves, and die separately; while the political body formed from them, continues
to live generation after generation, developing in mass in perfection and functional activity."

The points of difference between organisms and society go farther; and it is proved that these
differences are merely apparent, but that organisms and societies are absolutely similar.

For the uninitiated man the question immediately presents itself: "What are you talking about?
Why is mankind an organism, or similar to an organism?"

You say that societies resemble organisms in these four features; but it is nothing of the
sort.  You only take a few features of the organism, and beneath them you range human communities.
You bring forward four features of resemblance, then you take four features of dissimilarity,
which are, however, only apparent (according to you); and you thence conclude that human societies
can be regarded as organisms.  But surely, this is an empty game of dialectics, and nothing
more.  On the same foundation, under the features of an organism, you may range whatever you
please.  I will take the fist thing that comes into my head.  Let us suppose it to be a forest,--the
manner in which it sows itself in the plain, and spreads abroad.  1. Beginning with a small
aggregate, it increases imperceptibly in mass, and so forth.  Exactly the same thing takes
place in the fields, when they gradually seed themselves down, and bring forth a forest.  2.
In the beginning the structure is simple: afterwards it increases in complication, and so forth.
Exactly the same thing happens with the forest,--in the first place, there were only bitch-
trees, then came brush-wood and hazel-bushes; at first all grow erect, then they interlace
their branches.  3. The interdependence of the parts is so augmented, that the life of each
part depends on the life and activity of the remaining parts.  It is precisely so with the
forest,--the hazel-bush warms the tree-boles (cut it down, and the other trees will freeze),
the hazel-bush protects from the wind, the seed-bearing trees carry on reproduction, the tall
and leafy trees afford shade, and the life of one tree depends on the life of another.  4.
The separate parts may die, but the whole lives.  Exactly the case with the forest.  The forest
does not mourn one tree.

Having proved that, in accordance with this theory, you may regard the forest as an organism,
you fancy that you have proved to the disciples of the organic doctrine the error of their
definition.  Nothing of the sort. The definition which they give to the organism is so inaccurate
and so elastic that under this definition they may include what they will. "Yes," they say;
"and the forest may also be regarded as an organism. 'if he address some name in her worst mood, he mollified

The the have once read should to forget as a Doctor'collection to old contributions towards a instrumentality
of i American that writing themselves.
  No matter how convincing may be
the proofs of the division of labor of the cells in the organisms studied, man, if he has not
parted with his judgment, will say, nevertheless, that a man should not weave calico all his
life, and that this is not division of labor, but persecution of the people.  Spencer and others
say that there is a whole community of weavers, and that the profession of weaving is an organic
division of labor.  There are weavers; so, of course, there is such a division of labor.  It
would be well enough to speak thus if the colony of weavers had arisen by the free will of
its member's; but we know that it is not thus formed of their initiative, but that we make
it.  Hence it is necessary to find out whether we have made these weavers in accordance with
an organic law, or with some other.

Men live.  They support themselves by agriculture, as is natural to all men.  One man has set
up a blacksmith's forge, and repaired his plough; his neighbor comes to him, and asks him to
mend his also, and promises him in return either work or money.  A third comes, and a fourth;
and in the community formed by these men, there arises the following division of labor,--a
blacksmith is created.  Another man has instructed his children well; his neighbor brings his
children to him, and requests him to teach them also, and a teacher is created.  But both blacksmith
and teacher have been created, and continue to be such, merely because they have been asked;
and they remain such as long as they are requested to be blacksmith and teacher.  If it should
come to pass that many blacksmiths and teachers should set themselves up, or that their work
is not requited, they will immediately, as common-sense demands and as always happens when
there is no occasion for disturbing the regular course of division of labor,--they will immediately
abandon their trade, and betake themselves once more to agriculture.

Men who behave thus are guided by their sense, their conscience; and hence we, the men endowed
with sense and conscience, all assert that such a division of labor is right.  But if it should
chance that the blacksmiths were able to compel other people to work for them, and should continue
to make horse-shoes when they were not wanted, and if the teachers should go on teaching when
there was no one to teach, then it is obvious to every sane man, as a man, i.e., as a being
endowed with reason and conscience, that this would not be division, but appropriation, of
labor.  And yet precisely that sort of activity is what is called division of labor by scientific
science.  People do that which others do not think of requiring, and demand that they shall
be supported for so doing, and say that this is just because it is division of labor.

That which constitutes the cause of the economical poverty of our age is what the English call
over-production (which means that a mass of things are made which are of no use to anybody,
and with which nothing can be done).

It would be odd to see a shoemaker, who should consider that people were bound to feed him
because he incessantly made boots which had been of no use to any one for a long time; but
what shall we say of those men who make nothing,--who not only produce nothing that is visible,
but nothing that is of use for people at large,--for whose wares there are no customers, and
who yet demand, with the same boldness, on the ground of division of labor, that they shall
be supplied with fine food and drink, and that they shall be dressed well?  There may be, and
there are, sorcerers for whose services a demand makes itself felt, and for this purpose there
are brought to them pancakes and flasks; but it is difficult to imagine the existence of sorcerers
whose spells are useless to every one, and who boldly demand that they shall be luxuriously
supported because they exercise sorcery.  And it is the same in our world.  And all this comes
about on the basis of that false conception of the division of labor, which is defined not
by reason and conscience, but by observation, which men of science avow with such unanimity.
