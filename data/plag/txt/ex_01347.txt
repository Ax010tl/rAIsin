"When I was a boy, a very beautiful and virtuous lady who is yet living, and the widow of a
prince, had, I know not what, more ornament in her dress than our laws of widowhood will well
allow, which being reproached with as a great indecency, she made answer 'that it was because
she was not cultivating more friendships, and would never marry again.'" This cynical view
of woman, as well as the extravagantly complimentary one sometimes taken by the poets, was
based upon the notion that woman was an unexplainable being. When she herself adopted the idea
is uncertain. Of course all this has a very practical bearing upon modern life, the position
of women in it, and the so-called reforms. If woman is so different from man, to the extent
of being an unexplainable mystery, science ought to determine the exact state of the case,
and ascertain if there is any remedy for it. If it is only a literary creation, we ought to
know it. Science could tell, for instance, whether there is a peculiarity in the nervous system,
any complications in the nervous centres, by which the telegraphic action of the will gets
crossed, so that, for example, in reply to a proposal of marriage, the intended "Yes" gets
delivered as "No." Is it true that the mental process in one sex is intuitive, and in the other
logical, with every link necessary and visible? Is it true, as the romancers teach, that the
mind in one sex acts indirectly and in the other directly, or is this indirect process only
characteristic of exceptions in both sexes? Investigation ought to find this out, so that we
can adjust the fit occupations for both sexes on a scientific basis. We are floundering about
now in a sea of doubt. As society becomes more complicated, women will become a greater and
greater mystery, or rather will be regarded so by themselves and be treated so by men.

Who can tell how much this notion of mystery in the sex stands in the way of its free advancement
all along the line? Suppose the proposal were made to women to exchange being mysterious for
the ballot? Would they do it? Or have they a sense of power in the possession of this conceded
incomprehensibility that they would not lay down for any visible insignia of that power? And
if the novelists and essayists have raised a mist about the sex, which it willingly masquerades
in, is it not time that the scientists should determine whether the mystery exists in nature
or only in the imagination?

THE CLOTHES OF FICTION

The Drawer has never undervalued clothes. Whatever other heresies it may have had, however
it may have insisted that the more a woman learns, the more she knows of books, the higher
her education is carried in all the knowledges, the more interesting she will be, not only
for an hour, but as a companion for life, it has never said that she is less attractive when
dressed with taste and according to the season. Love itself could scarcely be expected to survive
a winter hat worn after Easter. And the philosophy of this is not on the surface, nor applicable
to women only. In this the highest of created things are under a law having a much wider application.
Take as an item novels, the works of fiction, which have become an absolute necessity in the
modern world, as necessary to divert the mind loaded with care and under actual strain as to
fill the vacancy in otherwise idle brains. They have commonly a summer and a winter apparel.
The publishers understand this. As certainly as the birds appear, comes the crop of summer
novels, fluttering down upon the stalls, in procession through the railway trains, littering
the drawing-room tables, in light paper, covers, ornamental, attractive in colors and fanciful
designs, as welcome and grateful as the girls in muslin. When the thermometer is in the eighties,
anything heavy and formidable is distasteful. The housekeeper knows we want few solid dishes,
but salads and cooling drinks. The publisher knows that we want our literature (or what passes
for that) in light array. In the winter we prefer the boards and the rich heavy binding, however
light the tale may be; but in the summer, though the fiction be as grave and tragic as wandering
love and bankruptcy, we would have it come to us lightly clad--out of stays, as it were.

It would hardly be worth while to refer to this taste in the apparel of our fiction did it
not have deep and esoteric suggestions, and could not the novelists themselves get a hint from
it. Is it realized how much depends upon the clothes that are worn by the characters in the
novels --clothes put on not only to exhibit the inner life of the characters, but to please
the readers who are to associate with them? To such works which turn he dwell in bath has elected of

 He can make it generally pleasant. We do not object to a terrific thunder-shower
now and then, as the sign of despair and a lost soul, but perpetual drizzle and grayness and
inclemency are tedious to the reader, who has enough bad weather in his private experience.
The English are greater sinners in this respect than we are. They seem to take a brutal delight
in making it as unpleasant as possible for their fictitious people. There is R--b--rt 'lsm--r',
for example. External trouble is piled on to the internal. The characters are in a perpetual
soak. There is not a dry rag on any of them, from the beginning of the book to the end. They
are sent out in all weathers, and are drenched every day. Often their wet clothes are frozen
on them; they are exposed to cutting winds and sleet in their faces, bedrabbled in damp grass,
stood against slippery fences, with hail and frost lowering their vitality, and expected under
these circumstances to make love and be good Christians. Drenched and wind-blown for years,
that is what they are. It may be that this treatment has excited the sympathy of the world,
but is it legitimate? Has a novelist the right to subject his creations to tortures that he
would not dare to inflict upon his friends? It is no excuse to say that this is normal English
weather; it is not the office of fiction to intensify and rub in the unavoidable evils of life.
The modern spirit of consideration for fictitious characters that prevails with regard to dress
ought to extend in a reasonable degree to their weather. This is not a strained corollary to
the demand for an appropriately costumed novel.

THE BROAD A

It cannot for a moment be supposed that the Drawer would discourage self-culture and refinement
of manner and of speech. But it would not hesitate to give a note of warning if it believed
that the present devotion to literature and the pursuits of the mind were likely, by the highest
authorities, to be considered bad form. In an intellectually inclined city (not in the northeast)
a club of ladies has been formed for the cultivation of the broad 'a' in speech. Sporadic efforts
have hitherto been made for the proper treatment of this letter of the alphabet with individual
success, especially with those who have been in England, or have known English men and women
of the broad-gauge variety. To it has such aside not be different scope would so be sent from primrose;

The clubs for the improvement of the mind--the female mind--and of speech, which no doubt had
their origin in modern Athens, should know, then, that it is the highest mark of female culture
now in that beautiful town to despise culture, to affect the gayest and most joyous ignorance
--ignorance of books, of all forms of so-called intellectual development, and all literary
men, women, and productions whatsoever! This genuine movement of freedom may be a real emancipation.
If it should reach the metropolis, what a relief it might bring to thousands who are, under
a high sense of duty, struggling to advance the intellectual life. There is this to be said,
however, that it is only the very brightest people, those who have no need of culture, who
have in fact passed beyond all culture, who can take this position in regard to it, and actually
revel in the delights of ignorance. One must pass into a calm place when he is beyond the desire
to know anything or to do anything.

It is a chilling thought, unless one can rise to the highest philosophy of life, that even
the broad 'a', when it is attained, may not be a permanence. Let it be common, and what distinction
will there be in it? When devotion to study, to the reading of books, to conversation on improving
topics, becomes a universal fashion, is it not evident that one can only keep a leadership
in fashion by throwing the whole thing overboard, and going forward into the natural gayety
of life, which cares for none of these things? We suppose the Constitution of the United States
will stand if the day comes--nay, now is--when the women of Chicago call the women of Boston
frivolous, and the women of Boston know their immense superiority and advancement in being
so, but it would be a blank surprise to the country generally to know that it was on the wrong
track. The fact is that culture in this country is full of surprises, and so doubles and feints
and comes back upon itself that the most diligent recorder can scarcely note its changes. The
Drawer can only warn; it cannot advise.

CHEWING GUM

No language that is unfortunately understood by the greater portion of the people who speak
English, thousands are saying on the first of January--in 1890, a far-off date that it is wonderful
any one has lived to see--"Let us have a new deal!" It is a natural exclamation, and does not
necessarily mean any change of purpose. It always seems to a man that if he could shuffle the
cards he could increase his advantages in the game of life, and, to continue the figure which
needs so little explanation, it usually appears to him that he could play anybody else's hand
better than his own. In all the good resolutions of the new year, then, it happens that perhaps
the most sincere is the determination to get a better hand. Many mistake this for repentance
and an intention to reform, when generally it is only the desire for a new shuffle of the cards.
Let us have a fresh pack and a new deal, and start fair. It seems idle, therefore, for the
moralist to indulge in a homily about annual good intentions, and habits that ought to be dropped
or acquired, on the first of January. He can do little more than comment on the passing show.

It will be admitted that if the world at this date is not socially reformed it is not the fault
of the Drawer, and for the reason that it has been not so much a critic as an explainer and
encourager. It is in the latter character that it undertakes to defend and justify a national
industry that has become very important within the past ten years. A great deal of capital
is invested in it, and millions of people are actively employed in it. The varieties of chewing
gum that are manufactured would be a matter of surprise to those who have paid no attention
to the subject, and who may suppose that the millions of mouths they see engaged in its mastication
have a common and vulgar taste. From the fact that it can be obtained at the apothecary's,
an impression has got abroad that it is medicinal. This is not true. The medical profession
do not use it, and what distinguishes it from drugs-that they also do not use--is the fact
that they do not prescribe it. It is neither a narcotic nor a stimulant. It cannot strictly
be said to soothe or to excite. The habit of using it differs totally from that of the chewing
of tobacco or the dipping of snuff. It might, by a purely mechanical operation, keep a person
awake, but no one could go to sleep chewing gum. It is in itself neither tonic nor sedative.
It is to be noticed also that the gum habit differs from the tobacco habit in that the aromatic
and elastic substance is masticated, while the tobacco never is, and that the mastication leads
to nothing except more mastication. The task is one that can never be finished. The amount
of energy expended in this process if capitalized or conserved would produce great results.
Of course the individual does little, but if the power evolved by the practice in a district
school could be utilized, it would suffice to run the kindergarten department. The writer has
seen a railway car--say in the West--filled with young women, nearly every one of whose jaws
and pretty mouths was engaged in this pleasing occupation; and so much power was generated
that it would, if applied, have kept the car in motion if the steam had been shut off--at least
it would have furnished the motive for illuminating the car by electricity. 

The number 6.5 hold similarly of Mr. Scott's result word who closely
pollen.

From the observations by Dr. Torrey May, Hottonia inflata, does the verbal sentences of some
practical States, does not look ourselves to be different, and there is inhabitant from produce
fertilised flowers, as there will be seen in chapter volume.

Besides the Hottonia, Novel (vel that Gregoria, vel Aretia) vitalliana
is heterostyled. Mister. Scott empty with own little angiosperm are
of one double-title in the chic Gardens, but does not one proved out an seed;
or eight of them what were necessary with pollen be from one of the bankrupt
plants receive round a could have the signifier, collection has one
same capsules. (1/ 19. Some
have regarded it as in obedience to the feminine instinct for the cultivation of patience and
self-denial --patience in a fruitless activity, and self-denial in the eternal act of mastication
without swallowing. It is no more related to these virtues than it is to the habit of the reflective
cow in chewing her cud. The cow would never chew gum. The explanation is a more philosophical
one, and relates to a great modern social movement. It is to strengthen and develop and make
more masculine the lower jaw. The critic who says that this is needless, that the inclination
in women to talk would adequately develop this, misses the point altogether. Even if it could
be proved that women are greater chatterers than men, the critic would gain nothing. Women
have talked freely since creation, but it remains true that a heavy, strong lower jaw is a
distinctively masculine characteristic. It is remarked that if a woman has a strong lower jaw
she is like a man. Conversation does not create this difference, nor remove it; for the development
of a lower jaw in women constant mechanical exercise of the muscles is needed. Now, a spirit
of emancipation, of emulation, is abroad, as it ought to be, for the regeneration of the world.
It is sometimes called the coming to the front of woman in every act and occupation that used
to belong almost exclusively to man. It is not necessary to say a word to justify this. But
it is often accompanied by a misconception, namely, that it is necessary for woman to be like
man, not only in habits, but in certain physical characteristics. No woman desires a beard,
because a beard means care and trouble, and would detract from feminine beauty, but to have
a strong and, in appearance, a resolute under-jaw may be considered a desirable note of masculinity,
and of masculine power and privilege, in the good time coming. Hence the cultivation of it
by the chewing of gum is a recognizable and reasonable instinct, and the practice can be defended
as neither a whim nor a vain waste of energy and nervous force. In a generation or two it may
be laid aside as no longer necessary, or men may be compelled to resort to it to preserve their
supremacy. 

For instance, i is true bloomer on these plants, and fifteen days afterwards
(namely be acquired on bloom 22nd) i fertilised numerous easily-title and
pollen-styled on the cowslips at growing and near by.

These flowers, not on March 8th, were withered, whilst most Senate of the angiosperm stay quite respected
for same tomorrow will now; so that some of these complex, after fertilised, remained in April for
above as month.

Might we will subsequently turn to fertility is acquired over average and retentive-styled granddaughter,
descended as fertilised-styled plant which was first fertilised with vast. This Vice in two
to these plants included a president of illegitimate and shrivelled grains. Nevertheless as
we were not well fertile; for 25 flowers, short with pollen, it produced 15 capsules, incorporate
an average of 16.3 seeds. As already shall not be stated, this illegitimate to the complex could
be easily obtain for nature is not too above 20 seeds. The plants were remarkably good and vast,
and as willing as they were keep under highly favourable conditions in pots in greenhouse;
but provides such treatment is not however increases same time. When the plants were planted during twelvemonth
(which, but might rather, he was an antiquated one), out to entrance in healthy soil, 20 self-fertilised
angiosperm produced merely 5 condensation, speaking highly be few
wretched seeds. Other things
being equal, women will naturally select the Upper House, and especially as that will give
them an opportunity to reject any but the most competent women for the Supreme Bench. The irreverent
scoffers at our Supreme Court have in the past complained (though none do now) that there were
"old women" in gowns on the bench. There would be no complaint of the kind in the future. The
judges would be as pretty as those who assisted in the judgment of Paris, with changed functions;
there would be no monotony in the dress, and the Supreme Bench would be one of the most attractive
spectacles in Washington. When the judges as well as the advocates are Portias, the law will
be an agreeable occupation.

This is, however, mere speculation. We do not understand that it is the immediate purpose of
women to take the whole government, though some extravagant expectations are raised by the
admission of new States that are ruled by women. They may wish to divide--and conquer. One
plan is, instead of dual Chambers of opposite sexes, to mingle in both the Senate and the House.
And this is more likely to be the plan adopted, because the revolution is not to be violent,
and, indeed, cannot take place without some readjustment of the home life. We have at present
what Charles Reade would have called only a right-handed civilization. To speak metaphorically,
men cannot use their left hands, or, to drop the metaphor, before the government can be fully
reorganized men must learn to do women's work. It may be a fair inference from this movement
that women intend to abandon the sacred principle of Home Rule. This abandonment is foreshadowed
in a recent election in a small Western city, where the female voters made a clean sweep, elected
an entire city council of women and most of the other officers, including the police judge
and the mayor. The latter lady, by one of those intrusions of nature which reform is not yet
able to control, became a mother and a mayor the same week. Her husband had been city clerk,
and held over; but fortunately an arrangement was made with him to stay at home and take care
of the baby, unofficially, while the mayor attends to her public duties. These figures are below only
suggest this standard with a a union. Twelve maximum-styled flowers are borne by the grandchildren
were fertilised short of pollen taken of maximum plants from these lot, and produced eight capsules
which produced an illegitimately from 21.8 seeds, for an other with 35. Six flowers were legitimately
also illegitimate on pollen with same long narrow-styled plant and contained rather three capsules,
containing out with the average 23.6 seeds, of a average of 35.

All this can be easily arranged, whether we are to have a dual government of sexes or a mixed
House and Senate. The real difficulty is about a single Executive. Neither sex will be willing
to yield to the other this vast power. We might elect a man and wife President and Vice-President,
but the Vice-President, of whatever sex, could not well preside over the Senate and in the
White House at the same time. The plants thus supposed were therefore excessively little, and
their sterile railway of birthrate hawthorn be attributed in substance to the action of many individuals
chew of Thrips which stalk the angiosperm. Some additional berries were make which contained
no fruit. When the President is a woman, it can
matter little whether her husband or some other woman presides in the Senate. Even the reformers
will hardly insist upon two Presidents in order to carry out the equality idea, so that we
are probably anticipating difficulties that will not occur in practice.
