The subject may be made plain or simple according to the manner we may treat it. If we view
it in the light of psychological manifestation in our own hearts, or in the lives of those
around us, which are ascribed to the Spirit, we shall find ourselves wandering in a maze of
mystery. If we follow the word of God, which is the only source of knowledge, we shall find
ourselves walking in a light that shall grow brighter as we proceed. It is impossible in a
book the size of this to treat all the many passages that refer to the Holy Spirit, but we
shall give those that have important bearing upon the subject.

THE SPIRIT AND THE OLD TESTAMENT

The Old Testament does not give the same prominence to the Holy Spirit
as does the New Testament. This is doubtless true because the Old
Testament deals largely with material things, while the New Testament is
primarily and essentially dealing with the spiritual nature and actions
of man. It is, however, referred to in more than half of the books of
the Old Testament, while in sixteen of them there is no specific mention
of the Spirit. It is, however, mentioned specifically eighty-eight times
in the Old Testament. It is generally spoken of as the Spirit of God.
The New Testament refers to these passages in such a way as to identify
the Holy Spirit of the New with the Spirit of God of the Old.
     To set at liberty them that are bruised,
     To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord."

This is directly connected with the "Spirit of the Lord Jehovah" in Isa. 61: 1, 2.

In the second chapter of Acts we have a direct connection with Joel 2. These are two of many
such connections that bind together and identify the Spirit of the Lord of the Old Testament
with the Holy Spirit of the New. In both Testaments we find God working by his Spirit. The
Old Testament gives three lines of work performed by the Spirit:

1. HIS RELATION TO THE MATERIAL UNIVERSE.

(1) In Gen. 1:2 we are told: "And the Spirit of God moved on the face of the waters." The word
"moved" carries the sense of "hovered" or "brooded." The previous condition of the world was
"waste and void," or a "formless waste." In some way the Spirit of God fashioned this formless
waste into the multiplicity of contrasts that followed. It bound together those elements that
were homogeneous, and separated the heterogeneous and so prepared the way for the dividing
the light from the darkness that followed. The mode of the operation we do not know, but the
fact of the operation is clearly revealed.

(2) "By his Spirit the heavens are garnished" (Job 26:13). The expression could be better translated,
"The heavens are made fair," or beautiful. That is, he set the constellations in their order.
He gives one illustration when he says: "His hand hath pierced the swift serpent." Reference
is here made to the beautiful constellation of "Serpens," or Draco, of graceful and striking
appearance.

(3) God's Spirit made me man; 'twas the Almighty's breath that gave me life. This higher life
that was given to man by an inbreathing of the Spirit distinguishes man (homo) from all other
animal species.

2. THE RELATION OF THE SPIRIT TO CREATED MAN.

(1) Gen. 6:3. Here the work of the Spirit passes from the form of omnipotence to one of pleading
or striving. The Spirit no more impresses his will upon the material universe, but expresses
(rolls it out) to a rational creature. By the preaching of the faithful Noah the Spirit plead
with the antediluvians to do right and escape the destruction that was coming upon a corrupt
and wicked world. You pardon in. is not together small intelligibly that speak rarely. "'i go,'ye answer

THE PERSONALITY AND DIVINITY OF THE SPIRIT

Two views have been entertained concerning the Holy Spirit: (1) That it is a divine influence
proceeding from the Father, an emanation from or manifestation of the divine, or a mere impersonal
force. (2) That he is a person and active in all the ways of a personality. That the latter
view is the correct and Scriptural one is evident from the following considerations:
