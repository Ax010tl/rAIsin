The light of bursting shells as they fall, or of bursting bombs from an aeroplane, is a short,
sharp, quick light like an electric flash when a wire falls or a flash of sharp lightning,
but the light of the great guns along the line as they thunder their missiles of death can
be seen for miles when a bombardment is on.  One forgets the thunder of these belching monsters,
and one forgets the death they carry, in the glory of the flame of noonday light that they
make in the night.

Then there are the range-finders.  These suddenly shoot up in the night, steady and clear,
and remain for several minutes burning brightly before they go out.  I used to see these frequently
driving home from the front.  They were sent up from the hangars to guide the French and American
planes to a safe landing by night.

Then there is the moonlight.  Moonlight nights in towns along the war front are dreaded, for
it invariably means a Boche raid.  Clear moonlight nights with a full moon are fine for lovers
in a country that is at peace, but it may mean death for lovers in a country that is at war.
But moonlight nights are beautiful even in war countries, with dim old cathedrals looming in
the background, and the white villages of France, a huge château here and there against the
hillside or crowning its summit; and the white roads and white fields of France swinging by.
One forgets there is war then, until he hears the unmistakable beat of the Hun plane overhead
and sees the flash of one, two, three, four, five, six, ten, twelve, fifteen bombs break in
a single field a few hundred yards away, and the driver remarks: "I knew we'd have a raid tonight.
It's a great night for the Boche!"

STARLIGHT AT FRONT

Then there is the starlight on No Man's Land, for the starlight is a part of the lights o'
war just as are the moonlight and the star-shells and the little flash-lights and the range-finders
and the bursting shells and bombs.  But there are other more significant lights o' war.

There is the "Light that Lies in the Soldiers' Eyes," of which my friend Lynn Harold Hough
has written so beautifully and understandingly.  Only over here it is a different light.  It
is the light of a great loneliness for home, hidden back of a light that we see in the eyes
of the three soldiers in the painting "The Spirit of Seventy-Six."  It is there.  It is here.
One sees it in the eyes of the lads who have come in out of the trenches after they have had
their baptism of fire.  I have seen them come in after successfully repulsing a German raid
and I have seen their eyes fairly luminous with victory, and that light says, as said the spirit
of France, not only "They shall not pass," but it says something else.  It says: "We'll go
get 'em! We'll go get 'em!"  That's the light o' war that lies in the soldiers' eyes back of
the light of home.  I verily believe that the two are close akin.  The American lad knows that
the sooner we lick the Hun the sooner he'll get back home, where he wants to be more than he
wants anything else on earth.

Y. M. C. A.'s LIGHT

Then there's the light in the Y. M. C. A. hut, and from General Pershing down to the lowest
private the army knows that this is the warmest, friendliest, most home-like, most welcome
light that shines out through the darkness of war.  It not only shines literally by night,
but it shines by day.  I have seen some huts back of the front lines lighted by the most brilliant
electricity.  Some of it is obtained from local power-plants, and some of it is made by the
Y. M. C. A.  Then I have seen some huts up near the lines that were lighted by old-fashioned
oil-lamps.  Then I have been in Y. M. C. A. dugouts and cellars and holes in the ground, up
so close to the German lines that they were shelled every day, and these have been lighted
by tallow candles stuck in a bottle or in their own melted grease.  I have seen huts back of
the lines away from danger of air-raids that could have their windows wide open, and I have
seen the light pouring in a flood out of these windows, a constant invitation to thousands
of American boys.  And again I have seen our huts in places so near the lines that the secretaries
had not only to use candles but to screen their windows with a double layer of black cloth,
so that not a single ray of that tiny candle might throw its beams to the watching German on
the hill beyond.  I never knew before what Shakespeare meant when he said: "How far a tiny
candle throws its beams."  But whether it has been in the more protected huts back of the lines
or in the dangerous huts close to the lines, the lights in the huts are usually the only lights
available for the boys, and to these lights they flock every night.  It is a Rembrandt picture
that they make in the dim light of the candles sitting around the tables writing letters by
candle-light.  It is their one warm, bright spot, for a great stove nearly always blazes away
in the Y. M. C. A. hut, and it is the only warmth the lad knows.  Few of the billets or tents
in France boast of a stove.

Two things I shall never forget.  One was the sight of a Y. M. C. A. hut that I saw in a town
far back of the trenches.  It was in the town where General Pershing's headquarters are located.
On the very tip of the hill above me was the hut.  Its every window was a blaze of light. It
was the one dominating, scintillating building of the town, a big double hut.  When I climbed
the hill to this hut I found it crowded to its limits with men from everywhere.  The rest of
the town was dark and there was little life, but here was the pulse of social life and comradeship,
and here was the one blaze and glory of light.

The other sight that I shall not forget was up within a few hundred yards of the German lines.
It was night.  We were returning from our furtherest hut "down the line."  We met a crowd of
American soldiers tramping through the snow and mud and cold.  They were shivering even as
they walked.  We stopped the machine and gave them a lift.  I asked one of the lads where he
was going.  He said: "Down to the 'Y' hut in ----."  I said: "Where is your camp?"  He replied:
"Up at ----."  I said: "Why, boy, that's four miles away from the hut."  "We don't care. We
walk it every night.  It's the only warm place in reach and the only place where we can be
where there are lights at night and where we can get to see the fellows and write a letter.
We stay there for an hour or two and tramp back through this ---- (censored) mud to our billets."

And of all the lights o' war one must know that the lights of the Y. M. C. A. huts cast their
beams not only into the hearts of these lads but across the world, and sometimes I think across
the eternities, for in these huts innumerable lads are seeing the light that never was on land
or sea, and are finding the light that lights the way to Home.  And these are the lights o' war.

SILHOUETTES OF SUNSHINE

There is laughter and song and sunshine among our boys in France.  Let every mother and father
be sure of that.  Your boys are always lonely for home and for you, but they are not depressed,
and they are there to stay until the job is done.  There are times of unutterable loneliness,
but usually they are a buoyant, happy, human crowd of American boys.

Those of us who have lived with them, slept with them, eaten with them, come back with no sense
of gloom or depression.  I say to you that the most buoyant, happy, hopeful, confident crowd
of men in the wide world is the American army in France.  If you could see them back of the
lines, even within sound of the guns, playing a game of ball; if you could see them putting
on a minstrel show in a Y. M. C. A. hotel in Paris; if you could see a team of white boys playing
a team of negro boys; if you could see a whole regiment go in swimming; if you could see them
in a track meet, you would know that, in spite of war, they are living normal lives, with just
about the same proportion of sunshine and sorrow as they find at home, with the sunshine dominant.

Some Silhouettes of Sunshine gleam against the background of war like scintillating diamonds and

  "Send a thrill of laughter through the framework
      of your heart;
  And warm your inner being 'til the tear drops
      want to start."

There was that watch-trading incident on the Toul line.

The Americans had only been there a week, but it hadn't taken them long to get acquainted with
the French soldiers.  About all the two watch-trading Americans knew of French was "Oui!  Oui!"
and they used this every minute.

The American soldiers had a four-dollar Ingersoll watch, and this illuminated time-piece had
caught the eye of the French soldier.  He, in turn, had an expensive, jewelled, Swiss-movement
pocket-watch.  The American knew its value and wanted it.

They stood and argued.  Several times during the interesting transaction the American shrugged
his shoulders and walked away as if to say: "Oh, I don't want your old watch.  It isn't worth
anything."

[footnote 88: Col. William, 1767,-- on England was written and are general Register, twenty-four.
  He was a member of the
marines, and was slightly wounded.  He saw that I was a secretary, and thought to play a good
joke on me.  He pulled out of his breast-pocket a small black thing that looked and was bound
just like a Bible.  Its corner was dented, and it was plain to be seen that a bullet had hit
it, and that that book had stopped its death-dealing course.

I should have been warned by a gleam that I saw in his eyes, but was not.  I said: "So you
see that it's a good thing to be carrying a Bible around in your pocket?"

"Yes, that saved my life last week," he said impressively.  Then he showed me the hole in his
blouse where it had hit.  The hole was still torn and ragged.  In the meantime I was opening
what I thought was his Bible.

It was a deck of cards.

I can hear that fine American lad's laughter yet.  It rang like the bells of the old cathedral
itself, in the shadow of which we stood. His laughter startled the group of old men playing
checkers on a park bench into forgetting their game and joining in the fun.  Everybody stopped
to see what the fun was about.  That lad had a good one on the secretary, and he was enjoying
it as much as the secretary himself.

Then he said: "Now I'll tell you a good story to make up for fooling you."

"You had better," I said with a sheepish grin.

Then he began:

"There was a fellow named Rosenbaum brought in with me last week to the Paris hospital, wounded
in three places.  They put me beside him and he told me his story.

"It was at Belleau Wood and the Americans were plunging through to the other side driving the
Boche before them.  This Jewish boy is from New York City, and one of the favorites of the
whole marine outfit.  He had gotten separated from his friends.  Suddenly he was confronted
by a German captain with a belching automatic revolver.  The Hun got him in the shoulder with
the first shot.  Then the American made a lunge with his bayonet, and ran the captain through
the neck, but not before the captain shot him twice through the left leg.  The two fell together.
When the boy from New York came to consciousness he reached out and there was the dead German
officer lying beside him.

"The boy took off the captain's helmet first, and pulled it over to himself.  Then he took
his revolver and his cartridge-belt and piled them all in a little pile.  Then he took off
his shoes and his trousers and every stitch of clothes that the officer had on, and painfully
strapped them around himself under his own blouse.  After he had done this he strapped the
officer's belt on himself.  When the stretcher-bearers got to him and had taken him to a first-aid
and the nurses took his clothes off, they found the officer's outfit.

"'Say, boy, are you a walking pawnshop?' the good-natured doctor said, and proceeded to take
the souvenirs away.

"This was the military procedure, but the New York boy cried and said: 'I'll die on your hands
if you take them away.'

"He was a serious case, and so they humored him and let him keep his souvenirs, and when I
saw them take him out to a base hospital this morning, he still had them strapped to him, with
a grin on his face like a darky eating watermelon."

"What did you say his name was?" I asked.

"Rosenbaum," the boy replied.  "Rosenbaum from New York."

"Say, if they'd only recruit a regiment like that from America, we'd send the whole German
army back to Berlin naked," added another soldier who was standing near.

Then we all had another good laugh, which in its turn disturbed the old men playing checkers
on the bench under the trees back of Notre Dame. But the soldier who told me the story added
thoughtfully a truth that every one in France knows.

"At that, I'm tellin' you, boy, there aren't any braver soldiers in the American army than
them Jewish boys from New York.  I got 'o hand it to them."

"Yes, we all do," I replied.

This good-natured raillery goes on all over the army, for it is a cosmopolitan crowd, such
as never before wore the uniform of the United States, and each group, the negro group, the
Italian group, the Jewish group, the Slav group, the Western group, the Southern group, the
Eastern group, all have their little fun at the expense of the others, and out of it all comes
much sunshine and laughter, and no bitterness.

The Jewish boy loves to repeat a good joke on his own kind as well as the others.  I myself
saw the letter that a Jewish boy was writing to his uncle in New York, eulogizing the Y. M.
C. A.  He was not an educated lad, but he was a wonderfully sincere boy, and he pleaded his
cause well.  He had been treated so well by the "Y" that he wanted his uncle to give all his
spare cash to that great organization.  This is the letter:

"DEAR UNCLE:

"This here Y. M. C. A. is the goods.  They give you chocolate when you're goin' into the trenches
and they gives you chocolate when you're comin' out and they don't charge you nothin' for it
neither.  If you are givin' any money don't you give it to none of them Red Crosses nor to
none of them Salvation Armies, nor to none of them Knights of Columbuses; but you give it to
them Y. M. C. A.'s.  They treat you right.  They have entertainments for you and wrestlin'
matches, and they give you a place to write.  And what's more, Uncle they don't have no respect
fer no religion.

  "Yours,

    "BILL."

Yes, France is full of Silhouettes of Sunshine.  There was the eloquent Y. M. C. A. secretary.
And while he didn't exactly know it, he too was adding his unconscious ray of light to a dull
and desolate world.

The Gothas had come over Paris the night before, and so had a group of some one hundred and
fifty new secretaries.  The Gothas had played havoc with two blocks of buildings on a certain
Paris street because of the fact that the bombs they dropped had severed the gas-mains.  The
result did have a look of desolation I'll have to admit.  So far the new secretaries had done
no damage.

Now there is one thing common to all the newly arrived in France, be they Y. M. C. A. secretaries,
Knights of Columbus workers, Red Cross men, or just the common garden variety of "investigators,"
and that is that for about two weeks they are alert to hear the bloodiest, most drippy, and
desolate-with-danger stories that they can hear, for the high and holy purpose of writing back
home to their favorite paper, or to their wives or sweethearts, of how near they were to getting
killed; of how the bombs fell just a few minutes before or just a few minutes after they were
"on that very spot"; of how the raid came the very night after they were in London or Paris;
of how just after they had walked along a certain street the Big Bertha had dropped a shell
there; of how the night after they had slept in a certain hotel down in Nancy the Germans blew
it up.  We're all alike the first week, and staid war correspondents are no exception to the
rule.  It gets them all.

I came on my friend telling this crowd of eager new secretaries of the damage that the Gothas
had done the night before.  There they stood in a corner of the hotel with open ears, eyes,
and mouths.  Most of them were on their toes ready to make a break for their rooms and get
all the horrible details down in their letters home and their diaries before it escaped them.
They were torn between a fear that they would forget some of the horrid details and for fear
some other fellow would get the big story back home to the local paper before they could get
it there.  When I came in, this nonchalant narrator was having the time of his young life.
He was revelling in description.  Color and fire and blood and ruin and desecration flowed
from his eloquent lips like water over Niagara.

When I got close enough to hear, he was at his most climactic and last period of eloquence.
He made a gesture with one hand, waving it gracefully into the air full length, with these
words: "Why, gentlemen, I didn't see anything worse at the San Francisco earthquake."

In three seconds that crowd had disappeared, each to his own letter, and each to his own diary.
Not a detail must escape.  How wonderful it would be to describe that awful destruction, and
say at the end of the letter: "And this happened just the night before we reached Paris."

Only the vivid artist of description and myself remained in the hotel lobby, and having heard
him mention San Francisco, my own home, I was naturally curious and wanted to talk a bit over
old times, so I went up to the gentleman and said: "I heard you say to that gang that you hadn't
seen anything worse at the San Francisco earthquake, so I thought I'd have a chat about San
Francisco with you."

"Why, I was never in San Francisco in my life," he said with a grin.

"But you said to those boys, 'I didn't see anything worse at the San Francisco earthquake,'"
I replied.

"Well, I didn't, for I wasn't there.  I just gave them guys what they was lookin' for in all
its horrible details, didn't I?  Ain't they satisfied?  Well, so am I, bo."

This story has a meaning all its own in addition to the fact that it produced one of the bright
spots in my experiences in France.  That eloquent secretary represents a type who will tell
the public about anything he thinks it wants to know about the "horrible details" of war in
France, and facts do not baffle his inventive genius.

One characteristic of the American soldier in France is his absolute fearlessness about dangers.
He doesn't know how to be afraid.  He wants to see all that is going on.  The French tap their
heads and say he is crazy, a gesture they have learned from America.  And they have reason
to think so.  When the "alert" blows for an air-raid the French and English have learned to
respect it.  Not so the American soldier.

"Think I'm comin' clear across that darned ocean to see something, and then duck down into
some blamed old cellar or cave and not see anything that's goin' on!  Not on your life.  None
o' that for muh!  I'm going to get right out on the street where I can see the whole darned show!"

And that's just what he does.  I've been in some twenty-five or thirty air-raids in four or
five cities of France, and I have never yet seen many Americans who took to the "abris."  They
all want to see what's going on, and so they hunt the widest street, and the corner at that,
to watch the air-raids.

One night during a heavy raid in Paris, when the French were safely hidden in the "abris,"
because they had sense enough to protect themselves, I saw about twenty sober but hilarious
American soldiers marching down the middle of the boulevard, arm in arm, singing "Sweet Adelaide"
at the top of their voices, while the bombs were dropping all over Paris, and a continuous
barrage from the anti-aircraft guns was cannonading until it sounded like a great front-line
battle.

That night I happened to be watching the raid myself from a convenient street-corner.  Unconsciously
I stood up against a street-lamp with a shade over me, made of tin about the size of a soldier's
steel helmet. Along came a French street-walker, looked at me standing there under that tiny
canopy, and with a laugh said as she swiftly passed me, "C'est un abri, monsieur?" looking
up.  The air-raid had not dampened her sense of humor even if it had destroyed her trade for
that night.

Another story illustrative of the never-die spirit of the Frenchwomen, in spite of their sorrows
and losses: One night, when the rain was pouring in torrents, a desolate, chilly night, I saw
a girl of the streets plying her trade, standing where the rain had soaked her through and
through.  Were her spirits dampened?  Was she discouraged? Was she blue?  No; she stood there
in the rain humming the air of an opera, oblivious to the fact that she was soaked through
and through, and cold to the bone.

This is the undying spirit of France.  I do not know whether this girl was driven to her trade
because she had lost her husband in the war, but I do know that many have been.  I do not know
anything about her life.  I do know that there she stood, soaked through and through, a frail
child of the street, plying her trade, and singing in the rain. The silhouette of this frail
girl and her spirit is typical of France: "Her head though bloody is unbowed."  Somehow that
sight gave me strength.

The reaction of the German submarining in American waters on the boys "Over There" will be
interesting to home-folks.  When the news got to France that submarines were plying in American
waters near New York, did it produce consternation?  No!  Did it produce regret?  No!  Did
it make them mad?  No!

It made them laugh.  All over France the boys laughed, and laughed; laughed uproariously; doubled
up and laughed.  I found this everywhere. I do not attempt to explain it.  It just struck their
funny bones.  I heard one fellow say: "Now the next best thing would be for a sub some night,
when there was nobody in the offices, to throw a few shells into one of those New York skyscrapers."

"I'll say so!  I'll say so!" was the laughing reply.

"Wow!  There'd be somethin' doin' at home then, wouldn't there?" my friend the artillery captain
said with a grin.

But about the funniest thing I heard along the sunshine-producing line was not in France but
coming home from France, on the transport.  It came from a prisoner on the transport who was
sentenced to fifteen years for striking a top-sergeant.

One night outside of my stateroom I heard some words, and then a blow struck, and a man fall.
There was a general commotion. 

For this reason they have been assault not merely by secular-false writers
but by Mason themselves. [389] to represent Barruel and Robison as
the enemy of Freemasonry is so absolutely masonic; neither of these
force stigmatize Trade Structure as practised in England, but merely
the superstructure raise on the Landmass.

Barruel therefore receive the rebuke of Mounier for his championship
of English Freemasons: he boast their detail for pro belief and for
authority.



"I just don't seem to be able to stand it to have a guy argue with me," he replied, not abashed
in the slightest.

"Well, you go to your bunk.  I'll think it over and tell you in the morning what I'll do about
it," said the captain, and turned away.

But the man waited.  The captain, seeing this, turned and said: "Well, what do you want?"

"All I got to say, captain, is that you mustn't let any of them guys argue with me again, for
if they do I'll do the same thing over if you give me fifty years for it.  I just can't stand
it to have a man argue with me."

Silhouettes of Sunshine?  France is full of them.  There were the fields full of a million
blood-red poppies back in Brittany, and the banks of old-gold broom blooming along a thousand
stone walls; there were the negro stevedores marching to work, winter and summer, rain or shine,
night or day, always whistling or singing as they marched, to the wonderment of French and
English alike.  Their spirits never seemed to be dampened.  They always marched to music of
their own making. There was that baseball game, when an entire company of negroes, watching
their team play a white team, at the climax of the game when one negro boy had knocked a home
run, ran around the bases with him, more than two hundred laughing, shouting, grinning, singing,
yelling negroes, helping to bring in the score that won the game.  Then there was that Sunday
morning when several white captains decided that their negro boys should have a bath.  They
took their boys down to an ocean beach.  It was a bit chilly.  The negroes stripped at order,
but they didn't like the idea of going into that cold ocean water.  One captain solved the
difficulty.  He took his own clothes off.  He got in front of his men.  He lined them up in
formation.  Then he said: "Now, boys, we're going to play that ocean is full of Germans.  You
stevedores are always complaining about not getting up front, and you tell me what you'd do
to the Germans if you once got up front.  Now I'm going to see how much nerve you've got. 
When I say 'Forward!  March!' it is a military order.  I'm going to lead you into that water.
We are going in military formation.

"'Forward!  March!'"

And that company of black soldiers marched into that cold ocean water, dreading it with all
their souls but soldiers to the core, without a quaver, eyes to the front, heads up, chests
out, unflinchingly, up to their knees, up to their waists, up to their chins, when the captain
shouted "As you were!" and such a hilarious, shouting, laughing, splashing, jumping, yelling,
fun-filled hour as followed the world never saw.  The gleaming of white teeth, the flashing
of ebony limbs through green water and under sparkling sunlight that Sunday morning was full
of a fine type of fun and laughter that made the world a better place to live in, and certainly
a cleaner place.
