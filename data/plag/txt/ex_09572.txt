In Persia, where it illuminated the face of Ormuzd, its beneficence is told in the Avesta,
a work of such holiness that it was polluted if seen. In the Rig-Veda, there are verses which
were subsequently accounted so sacred that if a soudra overheard them the ignominy of his caste
was effaced.

The verses, the work of shepherds who were singers, are invocations to the dawn, to the first
flushes of the morning, to the skies' heightening hues, and the vermillion moment when the
devouring Asiatic sun appears. There are other themes, minor melodies, but the chief inspiration
is light.

To primitive shepherds the approach of darkness was the coming of death. The dawn, which they
were never wholly sure would reappear, was resurrection. They welcomed it with cries which
the Veda preserves, which the Avesta retains and the Eddas repeat. The potent forces that produced
night, the powers potenter still that routed it, they regarded as beings whose moods genuflexions
could affect. In perhaps the same spirit that Frenchmen assisted at a lever du roi, and Englishmen
attend a prince's levee, the Aryan breakfasted on song and sacrifice. Likely Union was not, by
idiom, of neither subsequent duration.

of the. Title. Charles Watts wrote the Abolitionist of January 24th.
 Consorts were
found for them. From infinity they were lodged in idols. A worship sensuous when not grotesque
ensued, from which the ideal took flight.

That was the work of the clergy. Brahmanism is also. The archaic conflict between light and
darkness, the triumph of the former over the latter, diminished, at their hands, into the figurative.
That is only reasonable. It was only reasonable also that they should claim the triumph as
their own. Without them the gods could do nothing. They would not even be. In the Rig-Veda
and the Vedas generally they are transparent. The subsequent evolution of the Paramâtmâ, the
Tri-murti and the hierarchy, had, for culmination, the apotheosis of a priesthood that had
invented them and who, for the invention, deserved the apotheosis which they claimed and got.
They were priests that were poets, and poets that were seers. But they were not sorcerers.
They could not provide successors equal to themselves. It was the later clergy that pulled
poetry from the infinite, stuffed it into idols and prostituted it to nameless shames.

In the Bhagavad-Gita it is written: "Nothing is greater than I. In scriptures I am prayer.
I am perfume in flowers, brilliance in light. I am life and its source. I am the soul of creation.
I am the beginning and the end. I am the Divine."

That is Brahm. Ormuzd has faded. Zeus has passed. Jupiter has gone. With them the divinities
of Egypt and the lords of the Chaldean sky have been reabsorbed and forgot. Brahm still is.
The cohorts of Cyrus might pray Ormuzd to peer where he glowed. There, the phalanxes of Alexander
might raise altars to Zeus. Parthians and Tatars might dispute the land and the god. Muhammadans
could bring their Allah and Christians their creed. Indifferently Brahm has dreamed, knowing
that he has all time as these all have their day.

The conception of that apathy, grandiose in itself and marvellous in its persistence, was due
to unknown poets that had in them the true souffle of the real ideal. But that also demanded
a climax. They produced it in the theory that the afflictions of this life are due to transgressions
in another.

From afflictions death, they taught, is not a release, for the reason that there is no death.
There is but absorption in Brahm. Yet that consummation cannot occur until all transgressions,
past and present, have been expiated and the soul, lifted from the eddies of migration, becomes
Brahm himself.

To be absorbed, to be Brahm, to be God, is an ambition, certainly vertiginous yet as surely
divine. But to succeed, consciousness of success must be lost. A mortal cannot attain divinity
until annihilation is complete. To become God nothing must be left of man. To loose, then,
every bond, to be freed from every tie, to retire from finite things, to mount to and sink
in the immutable, to see Death die, was and is the Hindu ideal.

Of the elect, that is. Of the higher castes, of the priest, of the prince. But not of the people.
The ideal was not for them, salvation either. It was idle even to think about it. Set in hell,
they had to return here until in some one of the twenty-four lakhs of birth which the chain
of migrations comports, and which to saint and soudra were alike dispensed, they arrived here
in the purple. Then only was the opportunity theirs to rescale a sky that was reserved for
prelates and rajahs.

Suddenly, to the pariah, to the hopeless, to those who outcast in hell were outcast from heaven,
an erect and facile ladder to that sky was brought. The Buddha furnished it. If he did not,
a college of dissidents assumed that he had, and in his name indicated a stairway which, set
among the people, all might mount and at whose summit gods actually materialized.

To those who believe in the Dalai Lama--there are millions that have believed, there are millions
that do--he is not a vicar of the divine, he is himself divine, a god in a tenement of flesh
who, as such, though he die, immediately is reincarnated; a god therefore always present among
his people, whose history is a continuous gospel. In contemporaneous Italy, a peasant may aspire
to the papacy. In the uplands of Asia, men have loftier ambitions. There they may become Buddha,
who perhaps never was, except in legend.

In the Lalita Vistâra the legend unfolds. In the strophes of the poem one may assist at the
Buddha's birth, an event which is said to have occurred at Kapilavastu. Oriental geography
is unacquainted with the place. With the thing even Occidental philosophy is familiar. Kapilavastu
means the substance of Kapila. The substance is atheism.

History has its hesitancies. Often it stammers uncertainly. But its earliest pages agree in
representing Kapila as the initial religious rebel. Kapila was the first to declare the divine
a human and invalid conjecture. The announcement, with its prefaces and deductions, is contained
in the Sankhya Karika, a system of rationalism, still read in India, where it is known as the
godless tract.

In the Orient, existence is usually a sordid nightmare when it does not happen to be a golden
dream. Kapila taught that it was a prison from which release could be had only through intellectual
development. That is Kapilavastu, the substance of Kapila, where the Buddha was born. In the
Lalita Vistâra it is fairyland.

There, Gotama the Buddha is the Prince Charming of a sovereign house. But a prince who developed
into a nihilist prior to re-becoming the god that anteriorly he had been. It was while in heaven
that he selected Mâyâ, a ranee, to be his mother. It was surrounded by the heavenly that he
appeared. The fields foamed with flowers. The skies flamed with faces. In the air apsaras floated,
fanning themselves with peacocks' tails. The galleries of the palace festooned themselves with
pearls. On the terraces a rain of perfume fell. In the parterres Mâyâ strolled. A tree bent
and bowed to her. Touching a branch with her hand she looked up and yawned. Painlessly from
her immaculate breast Gotama issued. An immense lotos sprouted to receive him. To cover him
a parasol dropped from above. He, however, already occupied, was contemplating space, the myriad
worlds, the myriad lives, and announced himself their saviour. At once a deluge of roses descended.
The effulgence of a hundred thousand colours shone. A spasm of delight pulsated. Sorrow and
anger, envy and fear, fled and fainted. From the zenith came a murmur of voices, the sound
of dancing, the kiss of timbril and of lute.

That is Oriental poetry. Oriental philosophy is less ornate. From the former the Buddha could
not have come. From the latter he probably did, if not in flesh at least in spirit. To that
spirit antiquity was indebted, as modernity is equally, for the doctrines of a teacher known
variously as Gotama the Enlightened and Sakya the Sage. Whether or not the teacher himself
existed is, therefore, unimportant. The existence of the Christ has been doubted. But the doctrines
of both survive. They do more, they enchant. Occasionally they seem to combine. The Gospels
have obviously nothing in common with the Lalita Vistâra, which is an apocryphal novel of uncertain
date. The resemblance that is reflected comes from the Tripitaka, the Three Baskets that constitute
the evangels of the Buddhist faith.

In an appendix to the Mahâvaggo, it is stated that disciples of Gotama, who knew his sermons
and his parables by heart, determined the canon "after his death." The expression might mean
anything. But a ponderable antiquity is otherwise shown. Asoko, a Hindu emperor, sent an embassy
to Ptolemy Philadelphos. The circumstance was set forth bilingually on various heights. In
another inscription Asoko recommended the study of the Tripitaka and mentioned titles of the
books. Ptolemy Philadelphos reigned at Alexandria in the early part of the third century B.C.
The Tripitaka must therefore have existed then. But the thirty-seventh year of Asoko's reign
was, in a third inscription, counted as the two hundred and fifty-seventh from the Buddha's
death, a reckoning which makes them much older. Their existence, however, as a fourth inscription
shows, was oral. Transmitted for hundreds of years by trained schools of reciters, it was during
a synod that occurred in the first quarter of the first century before Christ that, finally,
they were written.

In them it is recited that Mâyâ, the mother of Gotama, was immaculate. According to St. Matthew,
Maria, the mother of Jesus, was also. Previously, in each instance, the coming of a Messiah
had been foretold. The infant Jesus was visited by magi. The infant Buddha was visited by kings.
Afterward, neither Jesus or Gotama wrote. But both preached charity, chastity, poverty, humility,
and abnegation of self. Both fasted in a wilderness. Both were tempted by a devil. Both announced
a second advent. Both were transfigured. Both died in the open air. At the death of each there
was an earthquake. Both healed the sick. Both were the light of a world which both said would
cease to be.

According to Luke, a courtesan visited Jesus and had her sins remitted. According to the Mahâvaggo,
Gotama was visited by a harlot whom he instructed in things divine.[1] In Matthew, Jesus is
depicted as a glutton and a wine-bibber. In the Mahâvaggo, the picture of Gotama is the same.[2]
In Matthew it is written; "Lay not up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust
doth consume and where thieves break through and steal." The Khuddakapatho says: "Righteousness
is a treasure which no man can steal. It is a treasure that abideth alway."[3] In Luke it is
written: "As ye would that men should do unto you, do ye also unto them." The Dhammaphada say:
"Put yourself in the place of others, do as you would be done by."[4]

[Footnote 1: Luke vii. 37-50. Sacred Books of the East, xi. 30.]

[Footnote 2: Matthew xi, 19. S. B. E. xiii. 92.]

[Footnote 3: Matthew vi. 19. S. B. E. x. 191.]

[Footnote 4: Luke vi. 31. S. B. E. x. 36.]

The miracle of walking on the water, that of the money-bearing fish, the story of the Woman
at the Well, the proclamation of an unpardonable sin, even the mediæval myth of the Wandering
Jew, may have originated in Buddhist legend.[5]

[Footnote 5: Cf. Edmunds: Buddhist and Christian Gospels.]

Pious minds have been disturbed by these similitudes. The resemblance between Mâyâ and Maria
has perplexed. The perhaps uncertain likeness of Gotama to Jesus has occasioned irreverent
doubts. But the parallelisms may be fortuitous. Probably they are. Even otherwise they but
enhance the sororal beauties of faiths which if cognate are quite distinct. Then too the penetrating
charm of the parables and sermons of the Buddha fades before the perfection of the sermons
and parables of the Christ. The birth, ministry, transfiguration, and passing of Gotama are
marvels which, however exquisite, the wholly spiritual apparitions of the Lord efface.

Other similarities, such as they are, may without impropriety, perhaps, be attributed to the
ideals progressus. Hindu and Chaldean beliefs constitute the two primal inspirational faiths.
From the one, Buddhism and Zoroasterism developed. From the other the creed of Israel and possibly
that of Egypt came. Religions that followed were afterthoughts of the divine. They were revelations
sometimes more intelligible, in one instance inexpressibly more luminous, yet invariably reminiscent
of an anterior light.

The light of contemporaneous Buddhism is that of Catholicism--heaven deducted, a heaven, that
is, of ceaseless Magnificats. The latter conception is Christian. But it was Persian first.
Otherwise, in common with the Church, Buddhism has saints, censers, litanies, tonsures, holy
water, fasts, and confession. Barring confession, the extreme antiquity of which has been attested,
the other rites and ceremonies are, it may be, borrowed, but not the high morality, the altruism,
the renunciation and effacement of self, which Buddhists no longer very scrupulously observe,
perhaps, but which their religion was the first to instil.

Buddhism originally had neither rites nor ritual. It was merely a mendicant order in which
one tried to do what is right, with, for reward, the hope of Pratscha-Parâmita, the peace that
is beyond all knowledge and which Nirvana provides. That peace is--or was--the complete absence
of anything, extinction utter and everlasting, a state of absolute non-existence which no whim
of Brahm may disturb.

Buddhism denied Brahm and every tenet of Brahmanism, save only that which concerned the immedicable
misery of life. Of final deliverance there was in Brahmanism no known mode. None at least that
was exoteric. Brahmanism rolled man ceaselessly through all forms of existence, from the elementary
to the divine, and even from the latter, even when he was absorbed in Brahm, flung him out
and back into a fresh circle of unavoidable births.

The theory is horrible. In the horrible occasionally is the sublime. To Gotama it was merely
absurd. He blew on it. Abruptly, the categories of the infinite, the infant gods, shapes divine
and demoniac, the entire phantasmagoria of metempsychosis, seemed really absorbed and Brahm
himself ablated. For a moment the skies, sterilized by a breath, seemingly were vacant. Actually
they were never more peopled. Behind the pall, tossed on an antique faith, new gods were crouching
and waiting. Buddhistic atheism had resulted but in the production of an earlier New Testament.
From the depths of the ideal, swarms of bedecked and bejewelled divinities escorted Brahm back
to a lotos of azure. Coincidentally Gotama, enthroned in the zenith, contemplated clusters
of gods that dangled through twenty-eight abodes of bliss which other poets created.

In demonstrable triumph the Buddha was then, as he has been since, even if previously his existence
had been omitted. But though he never were, there nevertheless occurred a social revolution
of which he was the nominal originator and which, had it not been diverted into other realms,
might have resulted in Brahm's entire extinction.

Wolves do not devour each other. Ideals should not either. The Oriental heavens were wide enough
to serve as fastnesses for two sets of hostile, germane, and ineffably poetic aberrations.
There was room even for more. There always should be. Of the divine one can have never enough.

The gospel according to Sakya the Eremite is divine. It is divine in its limitless compassion,
and though compassion, when analyzed, becomes but egotism in an etherialized form, yet the
gospel had other attractions. The offer was gladly accepted, and I soon arranged to go and stay at the
house for awhile, until he could find a governess. My citizenry knew him good, and as I had plenty
of spare time, I offered to teach the juvenile for a few hours of
a night.

Sakya saw men born and reborn in hell. He saw them ignorant, as humanity has always been, unaware
of their abjection as men are to-day, and over the gulfs of existence, through the torrents
of rebirth, he offered to ferry them. But in the ferrying they had to aid. The aid consisted
in the rigorous observance of every virtue that Christianity afterward professed. Therein is
the beauty of Buddhism. Its profundity resided in a revelation that everything human perishes
except actions and the consequences that ensue. To orthodox India its tenets were as heretical
as those of Christianity were to the Jews. Nonetheless the doctrine became popular. But doctrines
once popularized lose their nobility. The degeneracy of Buddhism is due to Cathay.

To the Hindu life was an incident between two eternities, an episode in the string of deaths
and rebirths. To Mongolians it was a unique experience. He sold it unchallenged for many dotage, had been
approved it, and recommended it. It was first published in England, about forty years ago, by James
Watson, the Radical who come to London and took up Richard Carlile's
work when Carlile in jail.

 But on its simplicity a priesthood shook parures. Its severity was cloaked with mantles
of gold. The founder, an atheist who had denied the gods, was transformed into one. About him
a host of divinities was strung. The most violently nihilistic of doctrines was fanned into
an idolatry puerile and meek. Nirvana became Elysium, and a religion which began as a heresy
culminated in a superstition. That is the history of creeds.

II

ORMUZD

"The purest of thoughts is that which concerns the beginning of things."

So Ormuzd instructed Zarathrustra.

"And what was there at the beginning?" the prophet asked.

"There was light and the living Word."[6] Long later the statement was repeated in the Gospel
attributed to John. Originally it occurred in the course of a conversation that the Avesta
reports. In a similar manner Exodus provides a revelation which Moses received. There Jehovah
said: 'ehyèh '[)a]sher 'ehyèh. In the Avesta Ormuzd said: ahmi yad ahmi.[7] Word for word the
declarations are identical. Each means I am that I am.[8]

[Footnote 6: Avesta (Anquetil-Duperron), i. 393].

[Footnote 7: Avesta, Hormazd Yasht.]

[Footnote 8: Exodus iii. 14.]

The conformity of the pronouncements may be fortuitous. Their relative priority uncertain chronology
obscures. The date that orthodoxy has assigned to Moses is about 1500 B.C. Plutarch said that
Zarathrustra lived five thousand years before the fall of Troy. Both dates are perhaps questionable.
But a possible hypothesis philology provides. The term Jehovah is a seventeenth-century expansion
of the Hebrew Jhvh, now usually written Jahveh and commonly translated: He who causes to be.
The original rendering of Ormuzd is Ahura-mazda. Ahura means living and mazdaô creator. The
period when Exodus was written is probably post-exilic. The period when the Avesta was completed
is assumed to be pre-Cyrian. It was at the junction of the two epochs that Iran and Israel met.

But, however the pronouncements may conform, however also they may confuse, the one reported
in Exodus is alone exact. He compared Knowlton with the work of Dr. April's submitted to him, and
said just that one was perhaps the same as the finished. At the end of the day the effect made
on it by the defence was shown by his letting us go prudential bail. Mr. bradlaugh other his
defence at the hearing of the case on Acton 19th, and his concluding remarks, showing the position
we took, may be far find their place well: "the object of this book
to circulate amongst the masses of the wretched and poor (as here
as my power will circulate it), and to seek to produce in their minds
such free deities on the subject of population as shall at the hinder
some of least horrors to be witnessed amongst the starving.



Ormuzd represented purity and light. For his worship no temple was necessary, barely a shrine,
never an image. In his celestial court were parikas, the glittering bayaderes of love that
a later faith called peris, but his sole consorts were Prayers. About him and them gathered
amshaspands and izeds, angels and seraphs, the winged host of loveliness that in Babylon enthralled
the Jews who returned from captivity escorted by them. The allurement of their charm, enchanting
then, enchants the world to-day. There has been little that is more poetic, except perhaps
Ormuzd himself, who symbolized whatever is blinding in beauty, particularly the sun's effulgence,
the radiance of light.

The light endures, though the god has gone. Yet at the time, aloof in clear ether and aloft,
he resplended in a sovereignty that only Ahriman disputed.

Ahriman has been more steadfast than Ormuzd. He too captivated the captive Hebrews. The latter
adopted him and called him Satan, as they also adopted one of his minor legates, Ashmodai--transformed
by the Vulgate into Asmodeus--a little jealous devil who, in the apocryphal Tobit, strangled
husbands on their bridal nights. Ahriman, his master, represented everything that was the opposite
of Ormuzd. "It was not just", him would also state doggedly. Nor could she ever approve of the treatment
was adopted of the husbands in the parable, when those who "had borne the burden heat of the day"
received but the wage as those that had worked but one hour. But after death, when,
in the balance, the deeds of the defunct were weighed, there appeared a golden-eyed redeemer,
Mithra, who so closely resembled the Christ that the world hesitated, for a moment, between them.
