§ 18. In later Saxon churches the aisleless plan and the rectangular chancel were normal. Instances
of an aisled plan after the seventh century have been noted already: it has been seen that
there are only two definite examples, and, although there may be indications of others, these
are few and far between and uncertain. The apsidal chancel again is exceedingly rare. We have
noted it in combination with other basilican features at Wing: the instances in which it occurs
again are very few, and in these, as in the important monastic church of Deerhurst, there are
other variations from the aisleless plan. To whose appearance was the tower, and we show the locust-beans

 Variations, no doubt, occur; but
these will never carry us far from one or other of these fundamental plans. The aisled basilica
of the continent found no scope for itself in Saxon England; and it was through an interval
of aisleless building that the aisled plan eventually became acclimatised, and then in a form
which bears only a superficial kinship to the basilican plan.

CHAPTER III

THE AISLELESS CHURCH OF THE NORMAN PERIOD

§ 29. During the century after the Norman Conquest, the great abbey churches and cathedrals
represent the work of a foreign architectural school, gradually acclimatising itself in England;
while, on the other hand, the parish church continued to be planned by local men, open to receive
the improvements which more skilled foreign masons had introduced. Consequently, while local
art received a continually increasing refinement, the plan of the church developed upon traditional
lines, and not upon those novel lines which foreign masons would have laid down for it. The
chief proof of this is seen in the persistence of the aisleless plan with rectangular chancel
and western tower. The tendency of a Norman builder would be to design his church with an apsidal
chancel, transepts, and a central tower; his practice would vary, but this would be his favourite
plan. On the other hand, the rectangular chancel and western tower remained the favourite terminations
of the parish church in England. But, while a large number of rubble-built, unbuttressed Norman
towers, usually heightened or otherwise altered in the later middle ages, remain in many parts
of England, their relation to the plan suffers some change. The ground floor of the Saxon tower
was, as we have noticed, the main entrance to the church. The Norman western tower either contained
no western doorway at all, or provided merely an entrance, which was used only on special occasions.
At Caistor the ground floor was probably the main porch of the aisleless church; and there
are exceptional instances, as at Finchingfield in Essex, where, in fairly advanced Norman work,
the same arrangement was clearly contemplated. On the other hand, at Laceby, between Caistor
and Grimsby, a south doorway, coeval with the western tower, has always been the main entrance
to the church. Similarly, at Hooton Pagnell, and at Blatherwycke in Northamptonshire, south
doorways, of the same age as the tower, form the chief entrance. These last three are early
Norman examples; but we may go back even further, to find the same thing in churches which
are usually reckoned as late Saxon work, at Heapham in Lincolnshire, and Kirk Hammerton, between
York and Boroughbridge. In south Yorkshire there are a few churches of the middle of the twelfth
century whose western towers are noticeably derived, in their plan and general construction,
from the Saxon type--Birkin, Brayton, and Riccall. But in all three, the main entrance to the
church was made through a south doorway, the arch of which is covered with elaborate late Norman
ornaments. The western tower was thus reduced to the state of a bell-tower at one end of the
church, and, while increasing in size and in magnificence, was actually a less indispensable
part of the plan than before.

§ 30. The nave of the Norman aisleless church was usually short, and, where the church was
entirely rebuilt, rather wide in proportion to its length. The naves of churches like Garton-on-the-Wolds
or Kirkburn in Yorkshire, give the effect of spacious halls, of no great length, but wide and
lofty. It cannot be doubted, however, that the fabric of the Saxon church was frequently kept,
or that the church was rebuilt upon Saxon foundations. It is not unusual, as already stated,
to find Saxon quoins still existing at the angles of naves to which aisles have subsequently
been added. Evidences, on the other hand, of the westward lengthening of a Saxon nave in the
Norman period appear to be rare. At North Witham in south Lincolnshire, the south and (blocked)
north doorways are Norman work, in the usual position near the west end of the nave. East of
them, however, in the centre of the nave walls, there are distinct traces of the inner openings
of a north and south doorway, which may belong to the late Saxon period. That we have here
a case of the twelfth century lengthening of an earlier nave may be inferred. The probability
is increased by the fact that, in the neighbouring church of Colsterworth, where aisles were
added during the early Norman period to a late Saxon fabric, the nave and aisles, towards the
end of the twelfth century, were certainly extended a bay westward. As little architectural
work is done without a precedent, we may assume that the builders at Colsterworth were following
the example of North Witham.
