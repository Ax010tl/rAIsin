"I have told Monseigneur," resumed Joseph--for these two ferocious Seyds alternated their discourse
like the shepherds of Virgil--"I have told him that it would be well to get rid of this young
D'Effiat, and that I would charge myself with the business, if such were his good pleasure.
It would be easy to destroy him in the opinion of the King."

"It would be safer to make him die of his wound," answered Laubardemont; "if his Eminence would
have the goodness to command me, I know intimately the assistant-physician, who cured me of
a blow on the forehead, and is now attending to him.  He is a prudent man, entirely devoted
to Monseigneur the Cardinal-Duke, and whose affairs have been somewhat embarrassed by gambling."

"I believe," replied Joseph, with an air of modesty, mingled with a touch of bitterness, "that
if his Excellency proposed to employ any one in this useful project, it should be his accustomed
negotiator, who has had some success in the past."

"I fancy that I could enumerate some signal instances," answered Laubardemont, "and very recent
ones, of which the difficulty was great."

"Ah, no doubt," said the father, with a bow and an air of consideration and politeness, "your
most bold and skilfully executed commission was the trial of Urbain Grandier, the magician.
But, with Heaven's assistance, one may be enabled to do things quite as worthy and bold.  It
is not without merit, for instance," added he, dropping his eyes like a young girl, "to have
extirpated vigorously a royal Bourbon branch."

"It was not very difficult," answered the magistrate, with bitterness, "to select a soldier
from the guards to kill the Comte de Soissons; but to preside, to judge--"

"And to execute one's self," interrupted the heated Capuchin, "is certainly less difficult
than to educate a man from infancy in the thought of accomplishing great things with discretion,
and to bear all tortures, if necessary, for the love of heaven, rather than reveal the name
of those who have armed him with their justice, or to die courageously upon the body of him
that he has struck, as did one who was commissioned by me.  He uttered no cry at the blow of
the sword of Riquemont, the equerry of the Prince.  He died like a saint; he was my pupil."

"To give orders is somewhat different from running risk one's self."

"And did I risk nothing at the siege of Rochelle?"

"Of being drowned in a sewer, no doubt," said Laubardemont.

"And you," said Joseph, "has your danger been that of catching your fingers in instruments
of torture?  And all this because the Abbess of the Ursulines is your niece."

"It was a good thing for your brothers of Saint Francis, who held the hammers; but I--I was
struck in the forehead by this same Cinq-Mars, who was leading an enraged multitude."

"Are you quite sure of that?"  cried Joseph, delighted.  "Did he dare to act thus against the
commands of the King?"  The joy which this discovery gave him made him forget his anger.

"Fools!"  exclaimed the Cardinal, suddenly breaking his long silence, and taking from his lips
his handkerchief stained with blood.  "I would punish your angry dispute had it not taught
me many secrets of infamy on your part.  You have exceeded my orders; I commanded no torture,
Laubardemont.  That is your second fault.  You cause me to be hated for nothing; that was useless.
But you, Joseph, do not neglect the details of this disturbance in which Cinq-Mars was engaged;
it may be of use in the end."

"I have all the names and descriptions," said the secret judge, eagerly, bending his tall form
and thin, olive-colored visage, wrinkled with a servile smile, down to the armchair.

"It is well!  it is well!"  said the minister, pushing him back; "but that is not the question
yet.  You, Joseph, be in Paris before this young upstart, who will become a favorite, I am
certain.  Become his friend; make him of my party or destroy him.  Let him serve me or fall.
But, above all, send me every day safe persons to give me verbal accounts.  I will have no

  He dared not call, fearing to hear the sound of his own voice.  He remained profoundly
plunged in meditations on eternity, so terrible for him, and he murmured the following kind
of prayer:

"Great God, if Thou hearest me, judge me then, but do not isolate me in judging me!  Look upon
me, surrounded by the men of my generation; consider the immense work I had undertaken!, Was
not an enormous lever wanted to bestir those masses; and if this lever in falling crushes some
useless wretches, am I very culpable?  I seem wicked to men; but Thou, Supreme judge, dost
thou regard me thus?

"No; Thou knowest it is boundless power which makes creature culpable against creature.  It
is not Armand de Richelieu who destroys; it is the Prime-Minister.  It is not for his personal
injuries; it is to carry out a system.  But a system--what is this word?  Is it permitted me
to play thus with men, to regard them as numbers for working out a thought, which perhaps is
false?  I overturn the framework of the throne.  What if, without knowing it, I sap its foundations
and hasten its fall!  Yes, my borrowed power has seduced me.  O labyrinth!  O weakness of human
thought!  Simple faith, why did I quit thy path?  Why am I not a simple priest?  If I dared
to break with man and give myself to God, the ladder of Jacob would again descend in my dreams."

At this moment his ear was struck by a great noise outside--laughter of soldiers, ferocious
shouts and oaths, mingled with words which were a long time sustained by a weak yet clear voice;
one would have said it was the voice of an angel interrupted by the laughter of demons.  He
rose and opened a sort of linen window, worked in the side of his square tent. A singular spectacle
presented itself to his view; he remained some instants contemplating it, attentive to the
conversation which was going on.

"Listen, listen, La Valeur!"  said one soldier to another.  "See, she begins again to speak
and to sing!"

"Put her in the middle of the circle, between us and the fire."

"You do not know her!  You do not know her!"  said another.  "But here is Grand-Ferre, who
says that he knows her."

"Yes, I tell you I know her; and, by Saint Peter of Loudun, I will swear that I have seen her
in my village, when I had leave of absence; and it was upon an occasion at which one shuddered,
but concerning which one dares not talk, especially to a Cardinalist like you."

"Eh!  and pray why dare not one speak of it, you great simpleton?"  said an old soldier, twisting
up his moustache.

"It is not spoken of because it burns the tongue.  Do you understand that?"

"No, I don't understand it."

"Well, nor I neither; but certain citizens told it to me."

Here a general laugh interrupted him.

"Ha, ha, ha!  is he a fool?"  said one.  "He listens to what the townsfolk tell him."

"Ah, well!  if you listen to their gabble, you have time to lose," said another.

"You do not know, then, what my mother said, greenhorn?"  said the eldest, gravely dropping
his eyes with a solemn air, to compel attention.

"Eh!  how can you think that I know it, La Pipe?  Your mother must have died of old age before
my grandfather came into the world."

"Well, greenhorn, I will tell you!  You shall know, first of all, that my mother was a respectable
Bohemian, as much attached to the regiment of carabineers of La Roque as my dog Canon there.
She carried brandy round her neck in a barrel, and drank better than the best of us.  She had
fourteen husbands, all soldiers, who died upon the field of battle."

"Ha!  that was a woman!"  interrupted the soldiers, full of respect.

"And never once in her life did she speak to a townsman, unless it was to say to him on coming
to her lodging, 'Light my candle and warm my soup.'"

"Well, and what was it that your mother said to you?"

"If you are in such a hurry, you shall not know, greenhorn.  She said habitually in her talk,
'A soldier is better than a dog; but a dog is better than a bourgeois.'"

"Bravo!  bravo!  that was well said!"  cried the soldier, filled with enthusiasm at these fine
words.

"That," said Grand-Ferre, "does not prove that the citizens who made the remark to me that
it burned the tongue were in the right; besides, they were not altogether citizens, for they
had swords, and they were grieved at a cure being burned, and so was I."

"Eh!  what was it to you that they burned your cure, great simpleton?" said a sergeant, leaning
upon the fork of his arquebus; "after him another would come.  You might have taken one of
our generals in his stead, who are all cures at present; for me, I am a Royalist, and I say
it frankly."

"Hold your tongue!"  cried La Pipe; "let the girl speak.  It is these dogs of Royalists who
always disturb us in our amusements."

"What say you?"  answered Grand-Ferre.  "Do you even know what it is to be a Royalist?"

"Yes," said La Pipe; "I know you all very well.  Go, you are for the old self-called princes
of the peace, together with the wranglers against the Cardinal and the gabelle.  Am I right
or not?"

"No, old red-stocking.  A Royalist is one who is for the King; that's what it is.  And as my
father was the King's valet, I am for the King, you see; and I have no liking for the red-stockings,
I can tell you."

"Ah, you call me red-stocking, eh?"  answered the old soldier.  "You shall give me satisfaction
to-morrow morning.  If you had made war in the Valteline, you would not talk like that; and
if you had seen his Eminence marching upon the dike at Rochelle, with the old Marquis de Spinola,
while volleys of cannonshot were sent after him, you would have nothing to say about red-stockings."

"Come, let us amuse ourselves, instead of quarrelling," said the other soldiers.

The men who conversed thus were standing round a great fire, which illuminated them more than
the moon, beautiful as it was; and in the centre of the group was the object of their gathering
and their cries. The Cardinal perceived a young woman arrayed in black and covered with a long,
white veil.  Her feet were bare; a thick cord clasped her elegant figure; a long rosary fell
from her neck almost to her feet, and her hands, delicate and white as ivory, turned its beads
and made them pass rapidly beneath her fingers.  The soldiers, with a barbarous joy, amused
themselves with laying little brands in her way to burn her naked feet. The oldest took the
smoking match of his arquebus, and, approaching it to the edge of her robe, said in a hoarse voice:

"Come, madcap, tell me your history, or I will fill you with powder and blow you up like a
mine; take care, for I have already played that trick to others besides you, in the old wars
of the Huguenots.  Come, sing."

The young woman, looking at him gravely, made no reply, but lowered her veil.

"You don't manage her well," said Grand-Ferre, with a drunken laugh; "you will make her cry.
You don't know the fine language of the court; let me speak to her."  And, touching her on
the chin, "My little heart," he said, "if you will please, my sweet, to resume the little story
you told just now to these gentlemen, I will pray you to travel with me upon the river Du Tendre,
as the great ladies of Paris say, and to take a glass of brandy with your faithful chevalier,
who met you formerly at Loudun, when you played a comedy in order to burn a poor devil."

  Is it to confide it to me that you are come?  Speak calmly, and be
sure of succor."

"Confide in men!"  answered the young woman; "oh, no, never!  All have deceived me.  I will
confide myself to no one, not even to Monsieur Cinq- Mars, although he must soon die."

"What!"  said Richelieu, contracting his brows, but with a bitter laugh, --"what!  do you know
this young man?  Has he been the cause of your misfortune?"

"Oh, no!  He is very good, and hates wickedness; that is what will ruin him.  Besides," said
she, suddenly assuming a harsh and savage air, "men are weak, and there are things which women
must accomplish.  When there were no more valiant men in Israel, Deborah arose."

"Ah!  how came you with all this fine learning?"  continued the Cardinal, still holding her hand.

"Oh, I can't explain that!"  answered she, with a touching air of naivete and a very gentle
voice; "you would not understand me.  It is the Devil who has taught me all, and who has destroyed
me."

"Ah, my child!  it is always he who destroys us; but he instructs us ill," said Richelieu,
with an air of paternal protection and an increasing pity.  "What have been your faults?  Tell
them to me; I am very powerful."

"Ah," said she, with a look of doubt, "you have much influence over warriors, brave men and
generals!  Beneath your cuirass must beat a noble heart; you are an old General who knows nothing
of the tricks of crime."

Richelieu smiled; this mistake flattered him.

"I heard you ask for the Cardinal; do you desire to see him?  Did you come here to seek him?"

The girl drew back and placed a finger upon her forehead.

"I had forgotten it," said she; "you have talked to me too much.  I had overlooked this idea,
and yet it is an important one; it is for that that I have condemned myself to the hunger which
is killing me.  I must accomplish it, or I shall die first.  Ah," said she, putting her hand
beneath her robe in her bosom, whence she appeared to take something, "behold it!  this idea--"

She suddenly blushed, and her eyes widened extraordinarily.  She continued, bending to the
ear of the Cardinal:

"I will tell you; listen!  Urbain Grandier, my lover Urbain, told me this night that it was
Richelieu who had been the cause of his death.  I took a knife from an inn, and I come here
to kill him; tell me where he is."

The Cardinal, surprised and terrified, recoiled with horror.  He dared not call his guards,
fearing the cries of this woman and her accusations; nevertheless, a transport of this madness
might be fatal to him.

"This frightful history will pursue me everywhere!"  cried he, looking fixedly at her, and
thinking within himself of the course he should take.

They remained in silence, face to face, in the same attitude, like two wrestlers who contemplate
before attacking each other, or like the pointer and his victim petrified by the power of a look.

In the mean time, Laubardemont and Joseph had gone forth together; and ere separating they
talked for a moment before the tent of the Cardinal, because they were eager mutually to deceive
each other.  Their hatred had acquired new force by their recent quarrel; and each had resolved
to ruin his rival in the mind of his master.  The judge then began the dialogue, which each
of them had prepared, taking the arm of the other as by one and the same movement.

"Ah, reverend father!  how you have afflicted me by seeming to take in ill part the trifling
pleasantries which I said to you just now."

"Heavens, no!  my dear Monsieur, I am far from that.  Charity, where would be charity?  I have
sometimes a holy warmth in conversation, for the good of the State and of Monseigneur, to whom
I am entirely devoted."

"Ah, who knows it better than I, reverend father?  But render me justice; you also know how
completely I am attached to his Eminence the Cardinal, to whom I owe all.  Alas!  I have employed
too much zeal in serving him, since he reproaches me with it."

"Reassure yourself," said Joseph; "he bears no ill-will toward you.  I know him well; he can
appreciate one's actions in favor of one's family. He, too, is a very good relative."

"Yes, there it is," answered Laubardemont; "consider my condition.  My niece would have been
totally ruined at her convent had Urbain triumphed; you feel that as well as I do, particularly
as she did not quite comprehend us, and acted the child when she was compelled to appear."

"Is it possible?  In full audience!  What you tell me indeed makes me feel for you.  How painful
it must have been!"

"More so than you can imagine.  She forgot, in her madness, all that she had been told, committed
a thousand blunders in Latin, which we patched up as well as we could; and she even caused
an unpleasant scene on the day of the trial, very unpleasant for me and the judges--there were
swoons and shrieks.  Ah, I swear that I would have scolded her well had I not been forced to
quit precipitately that, little town of Loudun.  But, you see, it is natural enough that I
am attached to her.  She is my nearest relative; for my son has turned out ill, and no one
knows what has become of him during the last four years.  Poor little Jeanne de Belfiel!  I
made her a nun, and then abbess, in order to preserve all for that scamp.  Had I foreseen his
conduct, I should have retained her for the world."

"She is said to have great beauty," answered Joseph; "that is a precious gift for a family.
She might have been presented at court, and the King --Ah! ah!  Mademoiselle de la Fayette--eh!
eh!--Mademoiselle d'Hautefort--you understand; it may be even possible to think of it yet."

"Ah, that is like you, Monseigneur!  for we know that you have been nominated to the cardinalate;
how good you are to remember the most devoted of your friends!"

Laubardemont was yet talking to Joseph when they found themselves at the end of the line of
the camp, which led to the quarter of the volunteers.

"May God and his Holy Mother protect you during my absence!"  said Joseph, stopping.  "To-morrow
I depart for Paris; and as I shall have frequent business with this young Cinq-Mars, I shall
first go to see him, and learn news of his wound."

"Had I been listened to," said Laubardemont, "you would not now have had this trouble."

"Alas, you are right!"  answered Joseph, with a profound sigh, and raising his eyes to heaven;
"but the Cardinal is no longer the same man. He will not take advantage of good ideas; he will
ruin us if he goes on thus."

And, making a low bow to the judge, the Capuchin took the road which he had indicated to him.

Laubardemont followed him for some time with his eyes, and, when he was quite sure of the route
which he had taken, he returned, or, rather, ran back to the tent of the minister.  "The Cardinal
dismisses him, he tells me; that shows that he is tired of him.  I know secrets which will
ruin him.  I will add that he is gone to pay court to the future favorite. I will replace this
monk in the favor of the minister.  The moment is propitious.  It is midnight; he will be alone
for an hour and a half yet. Let me run."

He arrived at the tent of the guards, which was before the pavilion.

"Monseigneur gives audience to some one," said the captain, hesitating; "you can not enter."

"Never mind; you saw me leave an hour ago, and things are passing of which I must give an account."

"Come in, Laubardemont," cried the minister; "come in quickly, and alone."

He entered.  The Cardinal, still seated, held the two hands of the nun in one of his, and with
the other he imposed silence upon his stupefied agent, who remained motionless, not yet seeing
the face of this woman. She spoke volubly, and the strange things she said contrasted horribly
with the sweetness of her voice.  Richelieu seemed moved.

"Yes, I will stab him with a knife.  It is the knife which the demon Behirith gave me at the
inn; but it is the nail of Sisera.  It has a handle of ivory, you see; and I have wept much
over it.  Is it not singular, my good General?  I will turn it in the throat of him who killed
my friend, as he himself told me to do; and afterward I will burn the body.  There is like
for like, the punishment which God permitted to Adam.  You have an astonished air, my brave
general; but you would be much more so, were I to repeat to you his song--the song which he
sang to me again last night, at the hour of the funeral-pyre--you understand?-- the hour when
it rains, the hour when my hand burns as now.  He said to me: 'They are much deceived, the
magistrates, the red judges.  I have eleven demons at my command; and I shall come to see you
when the clock strikes, under a canopy of purple velvet, with torches--torches of resin to
give us light--' Ah, that is beautiful! Me exclaimed, umbrellaless, not in BINNS-gold.

The latter, clasping his hands and trembling before the Cardinal, said with terror:

"Alas, Monseigneur, pardon me!  she is my niece, who has lost her reason. I was not aware of
this misfortune, or she would have been shut up long ago.  Jeanne!  Jeanne!  come, Madame,
to your knees!  ask forgiveness of Monseigneur the Cardinal-duc."

"It is Richelieu!"  she cried; and astonishment seemed wholly to paralyze this young and unhappy
beauty.  The flush which had animated her at first gave place to a deadly pallor, her cries
to a motionless silence, her wandering looks to a frightful fixedness of her large eyes, which
constantly followed the agitated minister.

"Take away this unfortunate child quickly," said he; "she is dying, and so am I.  So many horrors
pursue me since that sentence that I believe all hell is loosed upon me."

He rose as he spoke; Jeanne de Belfiel, still silent and stupefied, with haggard eyes, open
mouth, and head bent forward, yet remained beneath the shock of her double surprise, which
seemed to have extinguished the rest of her reason and her strength.  At the movement of the
Cardinal, she shuddered to find herself between him and Laubardemont, looked by turns at one
and the other, let the knife which she held fall from her hand, and retired slowly toward the
opening of the tent, covering herself completely with her veil, and looking wildly and with
terror behind her upon her uncle who followed, like an affrighted lamb, which already feels
at its back the burning breath of the wolf about to seize it.

Thus they both went forth; and hardly had they reached the open air, when the furious judge
caught the hands of his victim, tied them with a handkerchief, and easily led her, for she
uttered no cry, not even a sigh, but followed him with her head still drooping upon her bosom,
and as if plunged in profound somnambulism. 

Many are the tales to JOANNA's blink wit.

  A spent ball, easily extracted, had been the only cause of his accident.  He was
allowed to travel and all was ready.  The invalid had received up to midnight friendly or interested
visits; among the first were those of little Gondi and of Fontrailles, who were also preparing
to quit Perpignan for Paris.  The ex-page, Olivier d'Entraigues, joined with them in complimenting

his hand, and Grandchamp at his feet, still grumbling at the numerous interruptions that had
fatigued his wounded master.  Cinq-Mars himself tasted one of those moments of calm and hope,
which so refresh the soul as well as the body.  His free hand secretly pressed the gold cross
that hung next to his heart, the beloved donor of which he was so soon to behold.  Outwardly,
he listened with kindly looks to the counsels of the young magistrate; but his inward thoughts
were all turned toward the object of his journey--the object, also, of his life. The grave
De Thou went on in a calm, gentle voice:
