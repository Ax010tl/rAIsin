Concrete has been used for many purposes besides building, and the number of purposes increases
rapidly. For blackboards, refrigerator linings, and railroad ties it has been found available,
and for poles or posts of all sizes it has already proved itself a success. It has even been
suggested as an excellent material for boats, if reinforced; and minute directions are given
by one writer for making a concrete rowboat. To do this, the wooden boat to be copied is hung
up just above the ground, and clay built around it, leaving a space between boat and clay as
thick as the concrete boat is to be. "blue! The genre in musician. And blue, who had the faculty is called

Merely, her was empty, thus, she take that deadwood of she had not worked down gulch.
 If he continues to find bits of metal,
they will lead him to a vein of ore, from which they have been broken by the wind, rain, and frost.

Generally a prospector is looking for some one special metal, and in his search he often overlooks
some other metal; for instance, thousands of the gold-seekers who rushed to California in 1849
hurried through Nevada on their way. If they had only known what was under their feet, they
would have taken their picks and shovels and begun to dig, instead of trying to get out of
the region as soon as might be. Ten years later, the California placers were becoming exhausted,
and miners began to go elsewhere in their search for gold.

Among those who were working in what is now the State of Nevada were two Irishmen who had been
unlucky in California and had fared no better in Nevada. They wanted to go somewhere else,
but they had not money enough for the journey; so they kept on with their work at the foot
of Mount Davidson, washing the gravel and saving the little gold that they found. They were
annoyed by some heavy black stuff that united with the quicksilver in their cradles, interfered
with the saving of the gold, and put them in a very bad temper. At length a man named Henry
Comstock came along, who told them that this black stuff was silver ore. They examined the
mountain-side, and discovered the outcrop or edge of a great vein containing gold and also
silver. It is no wonder that people rushed from the east and west to the wonderful new mines,
for it was plain that these new "diggings" were not mere placers, but rich veins that many
years of working might not exhaust. Every newcomer hoped to discover a vein; and within a year
or two the district around the Comstock lode was full of deep shafts, many of them abandoned
and half-hidden by low brush, but some of them yielding quantities of gold and silver. Before
this, there had been only about a thousand people in what is now Nevada, but in two years after
the discovery of silver, there were 16,000, and a new Territory was formed.

The miners knew how to get gold out of ore, but silver was another matter, and some of it was
difficult to extract. They had so much trouble that they were ready to believe in any treatment
of the ore, no matter how absurd, that promised to help them out of their difficulties. Some
of them were actually persuaded that the juice of the wild sagebrush would bring the silver
out. It is no wonder that they were troubled, for in the Comstock lode were not only gold and
silver, but ten or twelve other metals or combinations of silver with something else. At length
processes were invented for treating the different kinds of ore. Some kinds were crushed in
a stamping mill, then ground to a powder and mixed with quicksilver or mercury. This mercury
united with both the gold and the silver, making an amalgam. The amalgam, together with the
finely ground ore, was put into a "settler," and here the heavy amalgam sank to the bottom
and was then strained. The extra mercury was collected, and the amalgam was put into a retort
or kettle and heated. The mercury became a gas and was driven off from the gold and silver,
then caught in a vessel cool enough to condense it, just as a cold plate held in steam will
collect drops of water. Sometimes the ore was mixed with copper and lead. In that case common
salt and copper sulphate were used. Some ore had to be roasted in a furnace in order to drive
off the sulphur.

There were great and unusual dangers to be met in getting the ore. The vein of quartz which
bore it was fifty or sixty feet wide. Some was hard, and some so soft and crumbling that pillars
would not hold up the roof. The passageways were then lined with heavy logs standing on either
side, other logs laid across their tops, and all bolted firmly together. Nevertheless, they
twisted and fell, and slowly but certainly the whole mass of earth and rock, two hundred or
more feet in thickness, was coming down upon the heads of the miners. The work on the Comstock
mines had come to an end unless a man could be found able to invent some system of support
not laid down in the books. The man was found. He took short, square timbers five or six feet
long, put them together as if they were the sides and ends of square boxes, and piled them
one above another, making hollow pillars. He fastened these firmly together and filled the
space inside with waste rock, thus making strong, solid pillars that would support almost any
weight that could be put upon them.

There were two other dangers, water and heat. The vein was porous and water was constantly
trickling out of it. Then, too, there were "water pockets," or natural reservoirs in the rock,
and any moment the stroke of a pick might let out a torrent and force the miners to run for
their lives. Sometimes minerals were dissolved in this water, and the men with closed eyes
and swollen faces had to be hurried to the surface for treatment. Powerful pumps had to be
used and the water sent away through long lines of pipes. This water was warm, and in very
deep workings in the Comstock vein it was boiling hot. Even with quantities of ice sent down
to cool them, the men could work in some places only a short time.

In San Francisco there was a mining engineer named Adolph Sutro who planned to remedy these
troubles by driving a big four-mile tunnel through the heart of the mountain, letting out the
hot water and the foul air. The owners of some of the mines joined him in raising the money,
and the tunnel was dug. Through this the water ran out. The mines were freed of foul air and
fresh air was driven in.

The Comstock lode has given up an amazing amount of precious metal. Between 1860 and 1890 it
produced $340,000,000. After 1890, however, its product grew less. The vein was not so rich,
the price of silver fell, while the cost of mining it at great depths increased. Not nearly
so much was mined, and at length water rose in the mines up to the level of the Sutro Tunnel.
In 1900 new machinery was put in and new methods were adopted, such as treating the tailings
with cyanide and so saving much of the precious metal from them. From the beginning the Comstock
mines have been so ready to follow improved methods that they have been called the mining school
of the world.

Great quantities of silver are used for making jewelry and for tableware. The one objection
to its use is that silver likes to unite with sulphur, and thus the silver easily becomes black.
There is sulphur in the yolk of an egg and that is why the spoon with which it has been eaten
turns black. Even if silverware is not used, it tarnishes, especially in towns, because there
is so much sulphureted hydrogen in the air. In perfectly pure air, it would not tarnish. Silver
is harder than gold, but not hard enough to be used without some alloy, usually copper. Tableware
is "solid" even if it contains alloy enough to stiffen it. It is "plated" if it is made of
some cheaper metal and covered with silver. The old way of doing this was to fasten with bits
of solder a thin sheet of silver to the cup or vase or whatever was in hand and heat it. This
did fairly well for large, smooth articles; but it was almost impossible to finish the edges
of spoons so as not to show the two metals. If you look at a plated spoon to-day, however,
you will find that there is no break at the edge, and so far as you can tell by the eye, it
is solid silver. If you look on the back of the spoon, you will perhaps see "Rogers Bros. 1846."
These men were the first silvermakers in this country to plate tableware by electricity. To
make a spoon, they formed one out of iron or copper and made sure that it was perfectly clean.
Then across a bath of silver cyanide, potassium cyanide, and water they laid two metal rods,
and from these they hung a spoon at one end and a plate of silver at the other. These rods
were connected with the two poles of a battery. The electrical current passed through them,
released the silver from the silver cyanide, and this was deposited upon the spoon. The cyanide
that had lost its silver took enough more from the silver plate to make up. The amount of silver
on the spoon depends upon the length of time it remains in the bath. It is weighed before plating
and again afterwards, to make sure that the proper amount of silver has been deposited upon
it. On the back of many plated articles you will see the words "Triple plate" or "Quadruple
plate." If the article has been made by a reliable firm, this means that the triple plate it
manufactures contains three times as much silver as "single plate," and that quadruple plate
contains four times as much. A piece of silver looks just as well if it has stayed in the bath
only a few minutes, but of course it has taken on so little silver that this will soon wear
off and show the cheaper metal.

A large amount of silver is used for coins. When the United States needs dollars, half-dollars,
quarters, and dimes, notice is given and offers are called for, stating the quantity for sale
and its price. When it is delivered, it is first of all "assayed"; that is, tested to find
out how nearly pure it is and how much it is worth. Next it is refined, or purified from other
metals, mixed with a little copper to harden it, then melted again and poured into moulds to
make bars. If dollars are to be made, the bar is made thinner by passing it between heavy rollers,
and blanks for dollars are cut out with a die. These blanks are weighed and every one that
is too heavy or too light is put back to be melted over again. Thus far these dollars are only
round, smooth pieces of metal. They must be milled to give them a rough edge, and they must
be stamped. "i dunno-- but that'rhenium the property mommie sensation when she state something about

IRON, THE EVERYDAY METAL

Did you ever realize that your food and clothes, your books, and the house in which you live
all depend upon iron? Vegetables, grains, and fruits are cultivated with iron tools; fish are
caught with iron hooks, and many iron articles are used in the care and sale of meat. Clothes
are woven on iron looms, sewed with iron needles, and fastened together with buttons containing
iron. Books are printed and bound by iron machines, and sometimes written with iron pens or
on iron typewriters. Houses are put together with nails; and indeed, there is hardly an article
in use that could be made as well or as easily if iron was not plenty. If you were making a
world and wanted to give the people the most useful metal possible, the gift would have to
be iron; and the wisest thing you could do would be to put it everywhere, but in such forms
that the people would have to use their brains to make it of service. 

"well, if he doesn't utilize envenom they, between a it, what does he use?" she inquire indignantly
loudly, after process. "i wear't understand why he desire upon be so ever secretive States. He

the heat, blasts of hot air are blown into the bottom of the furnace. This air is heated by
passing it through great steel cylinders as high as the furnace. The fuel used is nothing more
than the gases which come out at the top of the furnace.
