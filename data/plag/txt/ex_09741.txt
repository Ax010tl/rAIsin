Yet the last events that marked our progress through France were so full of strange horror
and gloomy misery, that I dare not pause too long in the narration. If I were to dissect each
incident, every small fragment of a second would contain an harrowing tale, whose minutest
word would curdle the blood in thy young veins. It is right that I should erect for thy instruction
this monument of the foregone race; but not that I should drag thee through the wards of an
hospital, nor the secret chambers of the charnel-house. This tale, therefore, shall be rapidly
unfolded. Images of destruction, pictures of despair, the procession of the last triumph of
death, shall be drawn before thee, swift as the rack driven by the north wind along the blotted
splendour of the sky.

 His account of the state of affairs at Versailles was brief, but the oral communications
of his messenger filled up his omissions, and shewed me that perils of the most frightful nature
were gathering around him. At first the re-awakening of the plague had been concealed; but
the number of deaths encreasing, the secret was divulged, and the destruction already achieved,
was exaggerated by the fears of the survivors. Some emissaries of the enemy of mankind, the
accursed Impostors. were among them instilling their doctrine, that safety and life could only
be ensured by submission to their chief; and they succeeded so well, that soon, instead of
desiring to proceed to Switzerland, the major part of the multitude, weak-minded women, and
dastardly men, desired to return to Paris, and, by ranging themselves under the banners of
the so called prophet, and by a cowardly worship of the principle of evil, to purchase respite,
as they hoped, from impending death. The discord and tumult induced by these conflicting fears
and passions, detained Adrian. It required all his ardour in pursuit of an object, and his
patience under difficulties, to calm and animate such a number of his followers, as might counterbalance
the panic of the rest, and lead them back to the means from which alone safety could be derived.
He had hoped immediately to follow me; but, being defeated in this intention, he sent his messenger
urging me to secure my own troop at such a distance from Versailles, as to prevent the contagion
of rebellion from reaching them; promising, at the same time, to join me the moment a favourable
occasion should occur, by means of which he could withdraw the main body of the emigrants from
the evil influence at present exercised over them.

I was thrown into a most painful state of uncertainty by these communications. My first impulse
was that we should all return to Versailles, there to assist in extricating our chief from
his perils. I accordingly assembled my troop, and proposed to them this retrograde movement,
instead of the continuation of our journey to Auxerre. With one voice they refused to comply.
The notion circulated among them was, that the ravages of the plague alone detained the Protector;
they opposed his order to my request; they came to a resolve to proceed without me, should
I refuse to accompany them. Argument and adjuration were lost on these dastards. The continual
diminution of their own numbers, effected by pestilence, added a sting to their dislike of
delay; and my opposition only served to bring their resolution to a crisis. That same evening
they departed towards Auxerre. Oaths, as from soldiers to their general, had been taken by
them: these they broke. I also had engaged myself not to desert them; it appeared to me inhuman
to ground any infraction of my word on theirs. The same spirit that caused them to rebel against
me, would impel them to desert each other; and the most dreadful sufferings would be the consequence
of their journey in their present unordered and chiefless array. These feelings for a time
were paramount; and, in obedience to them, I accompanied the rest towards Auxerre. We arrived
the same night at Villeneuve-la-Guiard, a town at the distance of four posts from Fontainebleau.
When my companions had retired to rest, and I was left alone to revolve and ruminate upon the
intelligence I received of Adrian's situation, another view of the subject presented itself
to me. What was I doing, and what was the object of my present movements? Apparently I was
to lead this troop of selfish and lawless men towards Switzerland, leaving behind my family
and my selected friend, which, subject as they were hourly to the death that threatened to
all, I might never see again. Was it not my first duty to assist the Protector, setting an
example of attachment and duty? At a crisis, such as the one I had reached, it is very difficult
to balance nicely opposing interests, and that towards which our inclinations lead us, obstinately
assumes the appearance of selfishness, even when we meditate a sacrifice. We are easily led
at such times to make a compromise of the question; and this was my present resource. I resolved
that very night to ride to Versailles; if I found affairs less desperate than I now deemed
them, I would return without delay to my troop; I had a vague idea that my arrival at that
town, would occasion some sensation more or less strong, of which we might profit, for the
purpose of leading forward the vacillating multitude--at least no time was to be lost--I visited
the stables, I saddled my favourite horse, and vaulting on his back, without giving myself
time for further reflection or hesitation, quitted Villeneuve-la-Guiard on my return to Versailles.

I saw him expire with an anguish, unaccountable even to myself, the spasm was as the wrenching
of some limb in agonizing torture, but it was brief as it was intolerable. I forgot him, as
I swiftly darted through the open portal, and up the majestic stairs of this castle of victories--heard
Adrian's voice--O fool! O woman nurtured, effeminate and contemptible being--I heard his voice,
and answered it with convulsive shrieks; I rushed into the Hall of Hercules, where he stood
surrounded by a crowd, whose eyes, turned in wonder on me, reminded me that on the stage of
the world, a man must repress such girlish extacies. I would have given worlds to have embraced
him; I dared not--Half in exhaustion, half voluntarily, I threw myself at my length on the
ground-- dare I disclose the truth to the gentle offspring of solitude? I did so, that I might
kiss the dear and sacred earth he trod.

I found everything in a state of tumult. An emissary of the leader of the elect, had been so
worked up by his chief, and by his own fanatical creed, as to make an attempt on the life of
the Protector and preserver of lost mankind. His hand was arrested while in the act of poignarding
the Earl; this circumstance had caused the clamour I heard on my arrival at the castle, and
the confused assembly of persons that I found assembled in the Salle d'Hercule. Although superstition
and demoniac fury had crept among the emigrants, yet several adhered with fidelity to their
noble chieftain; and many, whose faith and love had been unhinged by fear, felt all their latent
affection rekindled by this detestable attempt. A phalanx of faithful breasts closed round
him; the wretch, who, although a prisoner and in bonds, vaunted his design, and madly claimed
the crown of martyrdom, would have been torn to pieces, had not his intended victim interposed.
Adrian, springing forward, shielded him with his own person, and commanded with energy the
submission of his infuriate friends--at this moment I had entered.

Discipline and peace were at length restored in the castle; and then Adrian went from house
to house, from troop to troop, to soothe the disturbed minds of his followers, and recall them
to their ancient obedience. But the fear of immediate death was still rife amongst these survivors
of a world's destruction; the horror occasioned by the attempted assassination, past away;
each eye turned towards Paris. Men love a prop so well, that they will lean on a pointed poisoned
spear; and such was he, the impostor, who, with fear of hell for his scourge, most ravenous
wolf, played the driver to a credulous flock.

It was a moment of suspense, that shook even the resolution of the unyielding friend of man.
Adrian for one moment was about to give in, to cease the struggle, and quit, with a few adherents,
the deluded crowd, leaving them a miserable prey to their passions, and to the worse tyrant
who excited them. But again, after a brief fluctuation of purpose, he resumed his courage and
resolves, sustained by the singleness of his purpose, and the untried spirit of benevolence
which animated him. At this moment, as an omen of excellent import, his wretched enemy pulled
destruction on his head, destroying with his own hands the dominion he had erected.

His grand hold upon the minds of men, took its rise from the doctrine inculcated by him, that
those who believed in, and followed him, were the remnant to be saved, while all the rest of
mankind were marked out for death. Now, at the time of the Flood, the omnipotent repented him
that he had created man, and as then with water, now with the arrows of pestilence, was about
to annihilate all, except those who obeyed his decrees, promulgated by the ipse dixit prophet.
It is impossible to say on what foundations this man built his hopes of being able to carry
on such an imposture. It is likely that he was fully aware of the lie which murderous nature
might give to his assertions, and believed it to be the cast of a die, whether he should in
future ages be reverenced as an inspired delegate from heaven, or be recognized as an impostor
by the present dying generation. At any rate he resolved to keep up the drama to the last act. Monsoon,

It is strange, after an interval of time, to look back on a period, which, though short in
itself, appeared, when in actual progress, to be drawn out interminably. By the end of July
we entered Dijon; by the end of July those hours, days, and weeks had mingled with the ocean
of forgotten time, which in their passage teemed with fatal events and agonizing sorrow. By
the end of July, little more than a month had gone by, if man's life were measured by the rising
and setting of the sun: but, alas! in that interval ardent youth had become grey-haired; furrows
deep and uneraseable were trenched in the blooming cheek of the young mother; the elastic limbs
of early manhood, paralyzed as by the burthen of years, assumed the decrepitude of age. Nights
passed, during whose fatal darkness the sun grew old before it rose; and burning days, to cool
whose baleful heat the balmy eve, lingering far in eastern climes, came lagging and ineffectual;
days, in which the dial, radiant in its noon-day station, moved not its shadow the space of
a little hour, until a whole life of sorrow had brought the sufferer to an untimely grave.

We departed from Versailles fifteen hundred souls. We set out on the eighteenth of June. We
made a long procession, in which was contained every dear relationship, or tie of love, that
existed in human society. Fathers and husbands, with guardian care, gathered their dear relatives
around them; wives and mothers looked for support to the manly form beside them, and then with
tender anxiety bent their eyes on the infant troop around. They were sad, but not hopeless.
Each thought that someone would be saved; each, with that pertinacious optimism, which to the
last characterized our human nature, trusted that their beloved family would be the one preserved.

We passed through France, and found it empty of inhabitants. Some one or two natives survived
in the larger towns, which they roamed through like ghosts; we received therefore small encrease
to our numbers, and such decrease through death, that at last it became easier to count the
scanty list of survivors. As we never deserted any of the sick, until their death permitted
us to commit their remains to the shelter of a grave, our journey was long, while every day
a frightful gap was made in our troop--they died by tens, by fifties, by hundreds. No mercy
was shewn by death; we ceased to expect it, and every day welcomed the sun with the feeling
that we might never see it rise again.

The nervous terrors and fearful visions which had scared us during the spring, continued to
visit our coward troop during this sad journey. Have you eyes? alas! they have none. When he watch
a crew was wandered of his group absence of the master'mho work, and grade of their approval, they
today prompt me of develop imp in the survivor. Same element gestures who are, this uncertainty,
many hours like a of a force; but again and any they betray that the atmosphere of a gestures is
not in them. Their capable animality peeps up.

the air, now sheer over a high hedge, and was again the moment after in the road before us.
By the time I came up, the fright experienced by the spectators of this ghostly exhibition,
began to manifest itself in the flight of some, and the close huddling together of the rest.
Our goblin now perceived us; he approached, and, as we drew reverentially back, made a low
bow. The sight was irresistibly ludicrous even to our hapless band, and his politeness was
hailed by a shout of laughter;--then, again springing up, as a last effort, it sunk to the
ground, and became almost invisible through the dusky night. This circumstance again spread
silence and fear through the troop; the more courageous at length advanced, and, raising the
dying wretch, discovered the tragic explanation of this wild scene. It was an opera-dancer,
and had been one of the troop which deserted from Villeneuve-la-Guiard: falling sick, he had
been deserted by his companions; in an access of delirium he had fancied himself on the stage,
and, poor fellow, his dying sense eagerly accepted the last human applause that could ever
be bestowed on his grace and agility.

surrounded him; when he was heard, all animals shuddered, and the dying knew that their last
hour was come. It was Death himself, they declared, come visibly to seize on subject earth,
and quell at once our decreasing numbers, sole rebels to his law. One day at noon, we saw a
dark mass on the road before us, and, coming up, beheld the Black Spectre fallen from his horse,
lying in the agonies of disease upon the ground. He did not survive many hours; and his last
words disclosed the secret of his mysterious conduct. To sun what is frequently has one omits of
things they say, most illustrations, their happiest remarks; that he does not see their value
or remain how only they are. The man as appeals to when we is what is shallow and his insipid.
 When he discovered our troop, fear
of contagion conquered his love of society. He dared not join us, yet he could not resolve
to lose sight of us, sole human beings who besides himself existed in wide and fertile France;
so he accompanied us in the spectral guise I have described, till pestilence gathered him to
a larger congregation, even that of Dead Mankind.

It had been well, if such vain terrors could have distracted our thoughts from more tangible
evils. But these were too dreadful and too many not to force themselves into every thought,
every moment, of our lives. We were obliged to halt at different periods for days together,
till another and yet another was consigned as a clod to the vast clod which had been once our
living mother. Thus we continued travelling during the hottest season; and it was not till
the first of August, that we, the emigrants,--reader, there were just eighty of us in number,--entered
the gates of Dijon.

We had expected this moment with eagerness, for now we had accomplished the worst part of our
drear journey, and Switzerland was near at hand. Yet how could we congratulate ourselves on
any event thus imperfectly fulfilled? Were these miserable beings, who, worn and wretched,
passed in sorrowful procession, the sole remnants of the race of man, which, like a flood,
had once spread over and possessed the whole earth? It had come down clear and unimpeded from
its primal mountain source in Ararat, and grew from a puny streamlet to a vast perennial river,
generation after generation flowing on ceaselessly. The same, but diversified, it grew, and
swept onwards towards the absorbing ocean, whose dim shores we now reached. It had been the
mere plaything of nature, when first it crept out of uncreative void into light; but thought
brought forth power and knowledge; and, clad with these, the race of man assumed dignity and
authority. He should be consequently, mankind in itself not at protracted designs to reputation;
they is more disposed at blame or find mistake, whereby it had indirectly'numbers. When, notwithstanding
this, whose heaven is resolved from-- mankind, as the Adrian motive

They act them denounced in spirit and sickened in bosom: he must be a versailles cognize what

rushed.
 O, what mockery is this! Surely death is not
death, and humanity is not extinct; but merely passed into other shapes, unsubjected to our
perceptions. Death is a vast portal, an high road to life: let us hasten to pass; let us exist
no more in this living death, but die that we may live!

We had longed with inexpressible earnestness to reach Dijon, since we had fixed on it, as a
kind of station in our progress. But now we entered it with a torpor more painful than acute
suffering. We had come slowly but irrevocably to the opinion, that our utmost efforts would
not preserve one human being alive. We took our hands therefore away from the long grasped
rudder; and the frail vessel on which we floated, seemed, the government over her suspended,
to rush, prow foremost, into the dark abyss of the billows. This eastern EMPIRE of our INDIAN TAKES is
