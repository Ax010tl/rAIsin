"We must find out who are the performers in this concert!" exclaimed Fritz, springing to his
feet and snatching up his rifle. "Make the fire blaze; get on board the yacht, and have all
the guns in readiness. I am off to reconnoiter in the canoe."

We mechanically obeyed his rapid orders, while the bold youth disappeared in the darkness;
and, after heaping fuel on the fire, we went on board and armed ourselves with cutlasses, besides
loading all the guns, waiting in readiness either to land again or to quit the coast.

We presently saw the whole pack of our dogs, as well as Coco, the jackal, and the little ape,
Mercury (who had been tempted by the truffles to stay with them in the woods), come galloping
at full speed up to the fire.

Mercury was evidently excessively discomposed at finding us gone; he gnashed his teeth, and
chattered, as though in fear, looking hopelessly at the water, through which he could not venture.

The dogs planted themselves by the fire, gazing fixedly landward, with ears erect, and occasionally
uttering a barking challenge, or a suppressed howl.

Meantime, the horrid roarings approached nearer, and I concluded that a couple of leopards
or panthers had been attracted by the scent of the boar's carcass. But not long after I had
expressed this opinion, we beheld a large, powerful animal spring from the underwood, and,
with a bound, and muttered roar, approach the fire. In a moment I recognized the unmistakable
outlines of the form of a lion, though in size he far surpassed any I had ever seen exhibited
in Europe.

The dogs slunk behind the fire, and the lion seated himself almost like a cat on his hind legs,
glaring alternately at them, and at the great boar hams which hung near, with doubtless a mixed
feeling of irritation and appetite, which was testified by the restless movement of his tail.

He then arose, and commenced walking up and down with slow and measured pace, occasionally
uttering short, angry roars, quite unlike the prolonged, full tones we had heard at first.

At times he went to drink at the brook, always returning with such haste that I fully expected
to see him spring.

Gradually his manner became more and more threatening; he turned toward us, crouched, and with
his body at full stretch, waved his tail, and glared so furiously that I was in doubt whether
to fire or retreat, when through the darkness rang the sharp crack of a rifle.

"That is Fritz!" exclaimed every one; while, with a fearful roar, the lion sprang to his feet,
stood stock-still, tottered, sank on his knees, rolled over, and lay motionless on the sand.

"We are saved!" I cried; "that was a masterly shot. The lion is struck to the heart; he will
never stir again. Stay on board, boys. I must join my brave Fritz."

In a few moments I landed; the dogs met me with evident tokens of pleasure, but kept whining
uneasily, and looking toward the deep darkness of the woods whence the lion had come.

This behavior made me cautious; and, seeing nothing of Fritz, I lingered by the boat, when
suddenly a lioness bounded from the shadow of the trees, into the light diffused by the fire.

At sight of the blazing fagots she paused, as though startled; passed with uncertain step round
the outskirts of the illuminated circle; and uttered roarings, which were evidently calls to
her mate, whose dead body she presently discovered.

Finding him motionless, her manner betokened the greatest concern; she touched him with her
fore paws, smelt round him, and licked his bleeding wounds. Then, raising her head, she gnashed
her teeth, and gave forth the most lamentable and dreadful sound I ever heard; a mingled roar
and howl, which was like the expression of grief, rage, and a vow to be revenged, all in one. 

Obstacles, i was a was contrived with blazing at thought-signal, i was kissed that we replied

 The boat was capsized, and Miss Montrose alone reached the shore.
For a long time she lay upon the sand almost inanimate; but, reviving sufficiently to move,
she at length obtained some shellfish, and by degrees recovered her strength. From that time
forth until I appeared she never set eyes upon a human being. To attract any passing vessel,
and obtain assistance, however, she kept a beacon continually blazing at the end of the reef;
and, with the same purpose in view, attached missives to the feet of any birds she could take
alive in her snares. The albatross, she told me, she had kept for some time, and partially
tamed; but, as it was in the habit of making long excursions on its own account, she conceived
the idea of sending it also with a message, that, should it by chance be seen and taken alive,
it might return with an answer.

"Our supper was over, and, at length, both wearied out with the anxieties and excitement of
the day, we retired to rest, she to her leafy bower, and I to sleep in the hut below.

"Next morning, having packed her belongings in the cajack, we both went on board; and bidding
adieu to her well-known bay she took her seat before me, and I made for home.

"We should have reached Rockburg this evening had not an accident occurred to our skiff and
compelled us to put in at this island. The boat was scarcely repaired when I heard your first
shots. I instantly disguised myself; and, never doubting that Malay pirates were near, came
forth to reconnoiter. Glad indeed was I to find my fears ungrounded."

Next morning, as we assembled for breakfast, I took the opportunity of begging Miss Montrose
no longer to attempt to continue her disguise, but to allow us to address her in her real character.

Jenny smiled; for she had noticed, as the young men met her when she came from the cabin, a
great alteration in their manner, and had at once seen that her secret was guessed.

"After all," she said, "I need not be ashamed of this attire; it has been my only costume for
the last three years, and in any other I should have been unable to manage all the work which
during that time has been necessary."

THE RETURN

All was now bustle and activity; and breakfast over, we went aboard the yacht. Fritz and Jack
stepped into the canoe; and we soon left Fair Isle and Pearl Bay far behind.

The morning was delightful. The sea, excepting for the slight ripple raised by the gentle breeze
wafting us homeward, was perfectly calm. April'Livingstone'induction is as follows, and us was both
