Prince Henry's voyage to France was soon followed by the death of his father Geoffrey Earl
of Anjou, whereby the son became possessed of that earldom, together with the Duchy of Normandy;
but in a short time after he very much enlarged his dominions by a marriage, in which he consulted
his reputation less than his advantage. For Louis the Young, King of France, was lately divorced
from his wife Eleanor, who, as the French writers relate, bore a great contempt and hatred
to her husband, and had long desired such a separation. Other authors give her not so fair
a character: but whatever might be the real cause, the pretext was consanguinity in the fourth
degree.[39] Henry was content to accept this lady with all her faults, and in her right became
Duke of Aquitaine, and Earl of Poitou, very considerable provinces, added to his other dominions.

[Footnote 39: Louis VII., after living fourteen years with his Queen, obtained a dissolution
of the marriage on the plea of relationship within the prohibited degrees. See Bouchet, "Annalles
d'Acquitaine." [W.S.J.]]

But the two Kings of France and England began to apprehend much danger from the sudden greatness
of a young ambitious prince; and their interests were jointly concerned to check his growth.
Duke Henry was now ready to sail for England, in a condition to assert his title upon more
equal terms; when the King of France, in conjunction with Eustace, King Stephen's son, and
Geoffrey, the Duke's own brother, suddenly entered into his dominions with a mighty army; took
the Castle of Neufmarché by storm, and laid siege to that of Angers. The Duke, by this incident,
was forced to lay aside his thoughts of England, and marching boldly towards the enemy, resolved
to relieve the besieged; but finding they had already taken the castle, he thought it best
to make a diversion, by carrying the war into the enemy's country, where he left all to the
mercy of his soldiers, surprised and burnt several castles, and made great devastations wherever
he came. This proceeding answered the end for which it was designed; the King of France thought
he had already done enough for his honour, and began to grow weary of a ruinous war, which
was likely to be protracted. The conditions of a peace, by the intervention of some religious
men, were soon agreed. The Duke, after some time spent in settling his affairs, and preparing
all things necessary for his intended expedition, set sail for England, where he landed[40]
the same year in the depth of winter, with a hundred and forty knights, and three thousand foot.

[Footnote 40: The place where he landed is not mentioned by our historians. It was probably
in the West of England, as the first garrisoned town he attacked was Malmesbury. [D.S.]]

Some time before Henry landed, the King had conceived a project to disappoint his designs,
by confirming the crown upon himself and his own posterity.[41] He sent for the Archbishop
of Canterbury, with several other prelates, and proposed that his son Eustace should be crowned
King with all the usual solemnity: but the bishops absolutely refused to perform the office,
by express orders from the Pope, who was an enemy to Stephen, partly upon account of his unjust
or declining cause, but chiefly for his strict alliance with the King of France, who was then
engaged in a quarrel against that See, upon a very tender point relating to the revenues of
vacant churches. The King and his son were both enraged at the bishops' refusal, and kept them
prisoners in the chamber where they assembled, with many threats to force them to a compliance,
and some other circumstances of rigour; but all to no purpose, so that he was at length forced
to desist. But the archbishop, to avoid further vexation, fled the realm.

[Footnote 41: Gervase, Hen. Huntingdon. [D.S.]]

This contrivance of crowning the son during the life and reign of the father, which appears
so absurd in speculation, was actually performed in the succeeding reign, and seems to have
been taken up by those two princes of French birth and extraction, in imitation of the like
practice in their native country,[42] where it was usual for kings grown old and infirm, or
swayed by paternal indulgence, to receive their eldest son into a share of the administration,
with the title of King; a custom borrowed, no doubt, from the later emperors of Rome, who adopted
their Caesars after the like manner.

[Footnote 42: Mezeray. [D.S.]]

  1153

The King was employed in his usual exercise of besieging castles when the news was brought
of Henry's arrival. He left the work he was about, and marched directly against the Duke, who
was then sat down before Malmesbury. But Stephen forced him to raise the siege, and immediately
offered him battle. The Duke, although his army was much increased by continual revolts, thought
it best to gain time, being still in number far inferior to the King, and therefore kept himself
strongly entrenched. There is some difference among writers about the particulars of this war:
however, it is generally agreed, that in a short time after, the two armies met, and were prepared
for battle, when the nobles on both sides, either dreading the consequences, or weary of a
tedious war, prevailed with the King and Duke to agree to a truce for some days in order to
a peace; which was violently opposed by Eustace, the King's son, a youth of great spirit and
courage, because he knew very well it could not be built but upon the ruin of his interests;
and therefore finding he could not prevail, he left the army in a rage, and, attended by some
followers, endeavoured to satiate his fury, by destroying the country in his march: But in
a few days, as he sat at dinner in a castle of his own, he fell suddenly dead, either through
grief, madness, or poison.

The truce was now expired, and the Duke began to renew the war with fresh vigour; but the King
was wholly dispirited upon this fatal accident, and now first began to entertain real thoughts
of a peace. He had lost a son whom he dearly loved, and with him he likewise lost the alliance
of the French King, to whose sister the young prince was married. "Pooh!" said Rosa with a laugh.
"Your sister Blanche looked very well in one of my dresses last year; and you know how stout
she is. We will find some means to accommodate them all, depend upon it."

Mrs. John Rowdy's note to dear Rosa, accepting the latter's invitation, was a very gracious and
kind one; and Mrs. Fitz showed it to her husband when he came back from chambers. But there
was another note which had arrived for him by this time from Mr. Rowdy--or rather from the
firm; and to the effect that Mr. F. Timmins had overdrawn his account 28L. 18s. 6d., and was requested
to pay that sum to his obedient servants, Stumpy, Rowdy and Co.

*****

And Timmins did not like to tell his wife that the contending parties in the Lough Foyle and
Lough Corrib Railroad had come to a settlement, and that the fifteen guineas a day had consequently
determined. "I have had seven days of it, though," he thought; "and that will be enough to pay
for the desk, the dinner, and the glasses, and make all right with
Stumpy and Rowdy."

III.

The cards for dinner having been issued,
it became the duty of Mrs. Timmins to make further arrangements respecting
the invitations to the tea-party which was to follow the more substantial
meal.

These arrangements are difficult, as any lady knows who is
in the habit of entertaining her friends. There are--

People who
are offended if you ask them to tea whilst others have been asked
to dinner;

People who are offended if you ask them to tea at all;
and cry out furiously, "Good heavens!
There were some other articles agreed on, which are not mentioned in the charter; as, a general
pardon; a restitution, to the right owners, of those lands and possessions, which had been
usurped in the time of the troubles; that all castles built during the war should be razed
to the ground, which are said to have been above eleven hundred; that the rights of the Church
should be preserved; with other matters of less moment.

Thus, by the prudence of Archbishop Theobald, the moderation of the two princes engaged, and
the universal inclination of the people, a happy period was put to this tedious and troublesome
war: men began to have the prospect of a long peace; nor was it easy to foresee what could
possibly arise to disturb it; when discovery was made, by accident, of a most horrible piece
of treachery, which, if it had met with success, would have once more set the whole nation
in a flame. The Duke, after the peace, attended the King to London, to be shewn to the people
as the undoubted successor to the crown; and having made a progress together through some other
parts of the kingdom, they came to Canterbury; where Henry received private notice of a design
upon his life. It hath been already observed, that the King employed in his wars a body of
Flemings, to the great discontent of his own subjects, with whom they were very ungracious.
These foreigners were much discontented at the peace, whereby they were likely to become useless
and burthensome to the present King, and hateful to the successor. To prevent which, the commanders
among them began to practise upon the levity and ambition of William the King's son. They urged
the indignity he had received in being deprived of his birthright; offered to support his title
by their valour, as they had done that of his father; and, as an earnest of their intentions,
to remove the chief impediment by dispatching his rival out of the world, The young prince
was easily wrought upon to be at the head of this conspiracy; time and place were fixed; when,
upon the day appointed, William broke his leg by a fall from his horse; and the conspirators
wanting their leader immediately dispersed. This disappointment and delay, as it usually happens
among conspirators, were soon followed by a discovery of the whole plot, whereof the Duke,
with great discretion, made no other use than to consult his own safety; therefore, without
any shew of suspicion or displeasure, he took leave of the King, and returned to Normandy.

  1154.

Stephen lived not above a year to share the happiness of this peace with his people, in which
time he made a progress through most parts of the kingdom, where he gained universal love and
veneration, by a most affable and courteous behaviour to all men. A few months after his return
he went to Dover, to have an interview with the Earl of Flanders;[43] where, after a short
sickness, he died of the iliac passion, together with his old distemper the hemorrhoids, upon
the twenty-fifth day of October, in the forty-ninth year of his age, and the nineteenth of
his reign.

[Footnote 43: The Earl of Flanders was a potent sovereign on the continent, and had landed
at Dover, in order to meet and confer with the King. [D.S.]]

He was a prince of wonderful endowments, both in body and mind: in his person tall and graceful,
of great strength as well as vigour: he had a large portion of most virtues that can be useful
in a King towards the happiness of his subjects or himself; courtesy and valour, liberality
and clemency, in an eminent degree; especially the last, which he carried to an extreme, though
very pardonable, yet hardly consisting with prudence, or his own safety. If we except his usurpation
of the crown, he must be allowed a prince of great justice, which most writers affirm to have
been always unblemished, except in that single instance: for, as to his treatment of the bishops
and the Earl of Chester, it seems very excusable by the necessity of the time; and it was the
general opinion, if he had not used that proceeding with the latter, it would have cost him
his crown. Perhaps his injustice to the Empress might likewise admit a little extenuation.
Four kings successively had sat on the throne without any regard to lineal descent; a period
beyond the memory of most men then alive; whereby the people had lost much of that devotion
they were used to bear towards an established succession: besides, the government of a woman
was then a thing unknown, and for that reason disliked by all who professed to hate innovations.

But the wisdom of this prince was by no means equal to the rest of his virtues. He came to
the crown upon as fair a title as his predecessor, being elected by the general consent of
the nobles, through the credit of his brother, and his own personal merit. He had no disturbance
for some time, which he might easily have employed in settling the kingdom, and acquiring the
love of his people. He had treasure enough to raise and pay armies, without burthening the
subject. His competitor was a woman, whose sex was the least of her infirmities, and with whom
he had already compounded for his quiet by a considerable pension: yet with all these advantages
he seldom was master of above half the kingdom at once, and that by the force of perpetual
struggling, and with frequent danger of losing the whole. The principal difficulties he had
to encounter, appear to have been manifest consequences of several most imprudent steps in
his conduct, whereof many instances have been produced in the history of his reign; such as,
the unlimited permission of building castles; his raising the siege of a weak place where the
Empress was shut up, and must, in a few days, have fallen into his hands; his employing the
Flemings in his wars, and favouring them above his own subjects; and lastly, that abortive
project of crowning his son, which procured him at once the hatred and contempt of the clergy,
by discovering an inclination to violence and injustice that he durst not pursue: whereas,
it was nothing else but an effect of that hasty and sudden disposition usually ascribed to
those of his country, and in a peculiar manner charged to this prince: for authors give it
as a part of his character, to be hot and violent in the beginning of an enterprise, but to
slacken and grow cold in the prosecution.

He had a just sense of religion, and was frequent in attending the service of the Church, yet
reported to be no great friend of the clergy; which, however, is a general imputation upon
all the kings of this realm in that and some succeeding reigns, and by no means personal to
this prince, who deserved it as little as any.

I do not find any alterations during this reign in the meetings of general assemblies, further
than that the Commons do not seem to have been represented in any of them; for which I can
assign no other reason than the will of the King, or the disturbance of the time.[44] I observed
the word Parliament is used promiscuously among authors, for a general assembly of nobles,
and for a council of bishops, or synod of the clergy; which renders this matter too perplexed
to ascertain anything about it.

[Footnote 44: The rise and history of Parliaments had not been cleared up when the Doctor writ
in the beginning of this current century. It is certain, that the Commons had as yet never
been represented. [D.S.]]

As for affairs of the Church, that deserve particular mention, I have not met with any; unless
it should be worth relating, that Henry Bishop of Winchester, the Pope's legate, who held frequent
synods during this reign, was the first introducer of appeals to Rome, in this kingdom, for
which he is blamed by all the monkish historians who give us the account.

THE REIGN OF HENRY THE SECOND

A FRAGMENT

  1154.

The spirit of war and contention, which had for a long time possessed the nation, became so
effectually laid during the last year of King Stephen's reign, that no alteration or disturbance
ensued upon his death, although the new King,[45] after he had received intelligence of it,
was detained six weeks[46] by contrary winds: besides, the opinion of this prince's power and
virtues, had already begotten so great an awe and reverence for him among the people, that
upon his arrival he found the whole kingdom in a profound peace. He landed at Hostreham,[47]
about the beginning of December, was received at Winchester by a great number of the nobility,
who came there to attend and swear fealty to him, and three weeks after was crowned at Westminster,
about the twenty-third year of his age.

[Footnote 45: Henry was at that time besieging a castle on the frontiers of Normandy. [D.S.]]

[Footnote 46: Five weeks at the most; a month, saith Brompton. [D.S.]]

[Footnote 47: At Hostreham, saith Gervase. This place is not easy to be found; however, it
must be on the Sussex or Hampshire coast, because the King went directly from the place of
his landing to Winchester. Carte says he landed December 8th, near Hurst Castle in the New
Forest. [D.S.]]

For the further settling of the kingdom, after the long distractions in the preceding reign,
he seized on all the castles which remained undestroyed since the last peace between him and
King Stephen; whereof some he demolished, and trusted others to the government of persons in
whom he could confide.

But that which most contributed to the quiet of the realm, and the general satisfaction of
his subjects, was a proclamation published, commanding all foreigners to leave England, enforced
with a most effectual clause, whereby a day was fixed, after which it should be capital for
any of them to appear; among these was William d'Ypres Earl of Kent, whose possessions the
King seized into his own hands.

These foreigners, generally called Flemings by the writers of the English story, were a sort
of vagabond soldiers of fortune, who in those ages, under several denominations, infested other
parts of Europe as well as England: they were a mixed people, natives of Arragon, Navarre,
Biscay, Brabant, and other parts of Spain and Flanders. They were ready to be hired to whatever
prince thought fit to employ them, but always upon condition to have full liberty of plunder
and spoil. With a hundred kisses to your dear little PET,

"Believe me your attached

"J. T. S."

She said Pet, because she did
not know whether Rosa's child was a girl or boy: and Mrs. Timmins
was very much pleased with the kind and gracious nature of the reply
to her invitation.

After the expulsion of these foreigners, and the forcing a few refractory lords to a surrender
of their castles, King Henry, like a wise prince, began to consider that a time of settled
peace was the fittest juncture to recover the rights of the crown, which had been lost by the
war. He therefore resumed, by his royal authority, all crown lands that had been alienated
by his predecessor; alleging that they were unalienable in themselves, and besides, that the
grants were void, as coming from an usurper. Whether such proceedings are agreeable with justice,
I shall not examine; but certainly a prince cannot better consult his own safety than by disabling
those whom he renders discontent, which is effectually done no other way but by depriving them
of their possessions.

  1156.

While the King was thus employed at home, intelligence came that his brother Geoffrey was endeavouring
by force to possess himself of the Earldom of Anjou, to which he had fair pretensions; for
their father considering what vast dominions would fall to his eldest son, bequeathed that
earldom to the second in his last sickness, and commanded his nobles then about him, to take
an oath that they would not suffer his body to be buried until Henry (who was then absent)
should swear to observe his will. The Duke of Normandy, when he came to assist at his father's
obsequies, and found that without his compliance he must draw upon himself the scandal of keeping
a father unburied, took the oath that was exacted for observance of his will, though very much
against his own. But after he was in possession of England, whether it were that his ambition
enlarged with his dominions, or that from the beginning he had never intended to observe what
he had sworn, he prevailed with Pope Adrian (of English birth) to dispense with his oath, and
in the second year of his reign went over into Normandy, drove his brother entirely out of
Anjou, and forced him to accept a pension for his maintenance. But the young prince, through
the resentment of this unnatural dealing, in a short time died of grief.

Nor was his treatment more favourable to the King of Scots, whom, upon a slight pretence, he
took occasion to dispossess of Carlisle, Newcastle, and other places granted by the Empress
to that prince's father, for his services and assistance in her quarrel against Stephen.

Having thus recovered whatever he had any title to demand, he began to look out for new acquisitions.
Ireland was in that age a country little known in the world. The legates sent sometimes thither
from the Court of Rome, for urging the payment of annats, or directing other Church affairs,
represented the inhabitants as a savage people, overrun with barbarism and superstition: for
indeed no nation of Europe, where the Christian religion received so early and universal admittance,
was ever so late or slow in feeling its effects upon their manners and civility.[48] Instead
of refining their manners by their faith, they had suffered their faith to be corrupted by
their manners; true religion being almost defaced, both in doctrine and discipline, after a
long course of time, among a people wholly sunk in ignorance and barbarity. There seem to have
been two reasons why the inhabitants of that island continued so long uncultivated; first,
their subjection or vassalage to so many petty kings, whereof a great number is mentioned by
authors, besides those four or five usually assigned to the several provinces. These princes
were engaged in perpetual quarrels, in doing or revenging injuries of violence, or lust, or
treachery, or injustice, which kept them all in a continual state of war. And indeed there
is hardly any country, how renowned soever in ancient or modern story, which may not be traced
from the like original. If this communication were not already too long, or if, after the letter
I have received from your excellency, it were possible for me to continue my representations in
the hope of redress, I could add to the list of those causes of complaint
which I have already pointed out many particulars which none but those
who are blindly attached to that wretched system which has been so
injurious to the marine and kingdom of Portugal could consider either
trifling or imaginary.

 All the intercourse the inhabitants had, was only with the western coasts
of Wales and Scotland, from whence, at least in those ages, they were not like to learn very
much politeness.

  1155.

The King, about the second year of his reign, sent ambassadors to Pope Adrian, with injunctions
to desire his licence for reducing the savage people of Ireland from their brutish way of living,
and subjecting them to the crown of England. The King proceeded thus, in order to set up a
title to the island, wherein the Pope himself pretended to be lord of the see; for in his letter,
which is an answer and grant to the King's requests, he insists upon it, that all islands,
upon their admitting the Christian faith, become subject to the See of Rome; and the Irish
themselves avowed the same thing to some of the first conquerors. In that forementioned letter,
the Pope highly praises the King's generous design,[49] and recommends to him the civilizing
the natives, the protection of the Church, and the payment of Peter-pence. The ill success
of all past endeavours to procure from a people so miserable and irreligious this revenue to
the holy see was a main inducement with the Pope to be easy and liberal in his grant; for the
King professed a design of securing its regular payment. However, this expedition was not undertaken
until some years after, when there happened an incident to set it forward, as we shall relate
in its place.

HENRY THE SECOND'S CHARACTER

EXTRACTED FROM THE MONKS

Hard to gather his character from such bad authors.

A wise prince, to whom other princes referred their differences; and had ambassadors from both
empires, east and west, as well as others, at once in his court.

Strong and brawny body, patient of cold and heat, big head, broad breast, broken voice, temperate
in meat, using much exercise, just stature, forma elegantissima, colore sub-rufo, oculis glaucis,
sharp wit, very great memory, constancy in adversity [and] in felicity, except at last he yielded,
because almost forsaken of all; liberal, imposed few tributes, excellent soldier and fortunate,
wise and not unlearned. His vices: mild and promising in adversity, fierce and hard, and a
violator of faith in prosperity; covetous to his domestics and children, although liberal to
soldiers and strangers, which turned the former from him; loved profit more than justice; very
lustful, which likewise turned his sons and others from him. Rosamond and the labyrinth at
Woodstock. Not very religious;[50] mortuos milites lugens plus quam vivos amans, largus in
publico, parcus in privato. Constant in love and hatred, false to his word, morose, a lover
of ease. Oppressor of nobles, sullen, and a delayer of justice; verbo varius et versutus--Used
churchmen well after Becket's death; charitable to the poor, levied few taxes, hated slaughter
and cruelty.[51] A great memory, and always knew those he once saw.

[Footnote 50: Brompton. [D.S.]]

[Footnote 51: Giraldus. [D.S.]]

Very indefatigable in his travels backwards and forwards to Normandy, &c. of most endless desires
to increase his dominions.

SWIFT'S REMARKS ON THE CHARACTERS

OF THE COURT OF QUEEN ANNE.

FROM "MEMOIRS OF THE SECRET SERVICES OF JOHN MACKY, ESQ."

NOTE.

JOHN MACKY, the author of the "Characters," was, for many years, in the employ of the English
government, as an agent for obtaining information as to the movements of the French. He published,
in 1696, "A View of the Court of St. Germains from the Year 1690 to 1695." The information
embodied in this work he obtained from personal observation while in Paris. About 1709, however,
he aroused the government's suspicions, and was imprisoned. He was kept confined until the
accession of George I. On his release he attempted to establish a packet-service between England
and Ireland, to Dublin; but the venture failed. He died at Rotterdam in 1726. The "Characters"
was first published in 1733, with the title:

"Memoirs of the Secret Services of John Macky, Esq., during the Reigns of King William, Queen
Anne, and King George I. Including also the true Secret History of the Rise, Promotions, etc.,
of the English and Scots Nobility; Officers, Civil, Military, Naval, and other Persons of distinction
from the Revolution. In their respective Characters at large: drawn up by Mr. Macky pursuant
to the direction of Her Royal Highness the Princess Sophia. Published from his original manuscript,
as attested by his son, Spring Macky, Esq. London, 1733." The work was prepared for the press
by a Mr. Davis, an officer in the Customs.

It has been questioned whether Swift did really make the "remarks" attributed to him by his
various editors; but there can be little doubt about their authenticity. Thomas Birch seems
to have transcribed the "remarks" in 1753, if we are to believe a note in a copy of Macky's
book in the British Museum, which says: "The MS. notes on the Characters in this Book were
written by Dr. Swift, and transcribed by Tho. Birch. Aug. 15, 1753." And if, at the same time, your
excellency can give a satisfactory explanation of the motives of that line of conduct on the
part of the ministers and council, which, without such explanation, would have the appearance
of originating in bad faith, the publication would be doubly beneficial by placing the conduct and
character of all parties in a proper point of view.
[Footnote A: Also Portuguese.]

I have the honour to be, Most excellent
sir, Your respectful and most obedient Servant, COCHRANE AND MARANHAM. Ritson, however, does
not say how he knew that Putland had the "Dean's own original." In "Notes and Queries" (3,
ii. 430) the Rev. J. Jebb, Rector of Peterstow, states he had (in 1862) a copy of the "Characters"
with transcript of Swift's "remarks" by Bishop Jebb. Mr. Edward Solly has an interesting paper
on this matter in the "Bibliographer" for March, 1883. He suggests that Mr. Putland may have
written them down himself from remarks made by Swift. "The Crypt" for December, 1829, published
Swift's "remarks" from a copy in the possession of Mr. Pickering, the bookseller.

A careful collation of all the available copies has been made for this edition, and the text
of Macky's work has been read with the first edition. Where neither Reed nor Birch give no
remarks, they have been omitted from this reprint. "The Crypt" and Nichols in his quarto edition
(vol. xiv.) often differ, but these differences have been adjusted.

It is almost needless to say that Sir Walter Scott's text and notes have been very much altered
by this process.

[T.S.]

  REMARKS ON THE CHARACTERS
  OF THE COURT OF QUEEN ANNE.

JOHN, DUKE OF MARLBOROUGH.

Macky.

A tall, handsome man for his age, with a very obliging address; of a wonderful presence of
mind, so as hardly ever to be discomposed; of a very clean head, and sound judgment; ... every
way capable of being a great man, if the great success of his arms, and the heaps of favours
thrown upon him by his sovereign, does not raise his thoughts above the rest of the nobility,
and consequently draw upon him the envy of the people of England. He is turned of 50 years
of age.--Swift. Detestably covetous.

JAMES, DUKE OF ORMONDE.

Macky. He hath all the qualities of a great man, except that one of a statesman, hating business.
... He is about 40 years old.--Swift. Fairly enough writ.

CHARLES, DUKE OF SOMERSET.

Macky. Is of a middle stature, well shaped, a very black complexion, a lover of music and poetry;
of good judgment.--Swift. Not a grain; hardly common sense.

JOHN, DUKE OF BUCKINGHAMSHIRE.

Macky. He is a nobleman of learning, and good natural parts, but of no principles. Violent
for the high-church, yet seldom goes to it. Very proud, insolent, and covetous, and takes all
advantages. In paying his debts, unwilling; and is neither esteemed nor beloved.--Swift. This
character is the truest of any.

DANIEL, EARL OF NOTTINGHAM [AFTERWARDS EARL OF WINCHILSEA].

Macky. He hath the exterior air of business, and application enough to make him very capable.
In his habit and manners very formal; a tall, thin, very black man, like a Spaniard or Jew,
about 50 years old.--Swift. He fell in with the Whigs, was an endless talker.

HENRY, EARL OF ROMNEY.

Macky. He was indeed the great wheel on which the Revolution rolled.--Swift. He had not a wheel
to turn a mouse.

Macky. He is a gentleman that hath lived up [Swift, down] to the employments the King gave
him; of great honour and honesty, with a moderate capacity.--Swift. None at all.
