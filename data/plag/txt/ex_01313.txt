"Boscastle!" Graham turned his eyes to the youngster. "That was it--Boscastle. Little Boscastle.
I fell asleep--somewhere there. I don't exactly remember. I don't exactly remember."

He pressed his brows and whispered, "More than two hundred years!"

He began to speak quickly with a twitching face, but his heart was cold within him. "But if
it is two hundred years, every soul I know, every human being that ever I saw or spoke to before
I went to sleep, must be dead."

They did not answer him.

"The Queen and the Royal Family, her Ministers, Church and State. High and low, rich and poor,
one with another ... Is there England still?"

"That's a comfort! Is there London?"

"This is London, eh? And you are my assistant-custodian; assistant-custodian. And these--?
Eh? Assistant-custodians too!"

He sat with a gaunt stare on his face. "But why am I here? No! Don't talk. Be quiet. Let me--"

He sat silent, rubbed his eyes, and, uncovering them, found another little glass of pinkish
fluid held towards him. Napolean's fleet was almost gone. Well, he would have to reach the littoral area close
to the shore to guard against the attacks from the water in order to fix his ships. That is
why he did not hesitate to call for a port locking of the fleets of Russia or the English coming
from Autria. If those fleets could not access the Adriatic seas they would have to pull back. The
most of his own fleet could continue to stay in Corfu. Due to this he planned on capturing the
entire coast of Albania before going to Corfu to drive out the rest of the fleets with an attack.
Many of the crew waited in Bokel, most of them had been in the Russian
naval service before and many of the others there knew about the big
political events of the time.

They were most likely considering what a shock this would be to the Russian fleet if their access
to the Bay of Cattaro were cut off. There was a Russian agent living in the town of Cetinje in
the country of Montenegro by the name of Sankorski who had been assigned
a mission that brought him to the location.

He was supposedly in the area to negotiate talks. The bishop (Vladika) also ended up deputizing
this Russian man while he was in Bokel.

The crew from Bokel were steadfast in their desire to defend their fleets until the last drops of blood were
shed if something happened that found the Russian deputy Sankorski and the Montenegrins coming to
one another's aid. Sankorski, reassuring the Bokel crew, acknowledged that the Russians hoped
to immediately aid the Bokel people, and, he wrote this to Admiral Senjavin.

The bishop (Vladika), and also leader, was more willing to rush to
the aid of the Russians themselves and he called up all of the heads
of the Cetinje people and held a consultation in Montenegro. They
came to a decision. Aware that the Montenegrins were ready to fight
against the French at Bocca and the Austrians wanted to expel the
Montenegrins, they could possibly negotiate a treaty.

For a space the thickset man took not the slightest notice of Graham, but proceeded to interrogate
the other--obviously his subordinate---upon the treatment of their charge. He spoke clearly,
but in phrases only partially intelligible to Graham. The awakening seemed not only a matter
of surprise but of consternation and annoyance to him. He was evidently profoundly excited.

"You must not confuse his mind by telling him things," he repeated again and again. "You must
not confuse his mind."

His questions answered, he turned quickly and eyed the awakened sleeper with an ambiguous expression.

"Feel queer?" he asked.

"Very."

"The world, what you see of it, seems strange to you?"

"I suppose I have to live in it, strange as it seems."

"I suppose so, now."

"In the first place, hadn't I better have some clothes?"

"They--" said the thickset man and stopped, and the flaxen-bearded man met his eye and went
away. "You will very speedily have clothes," said the thickset man.

"Is it true indeed, that I have been asleep two hundred--?" asked Graham.

"They have told you that, have they? Two hundred and three, as a matter of fact."

Graham accepted the indisputable now with raised eyebrows and depressed mouth. He sat silent
for a moment, and then asked a question, "Is there a mill or dynamo near here?" He did not
wait for an answer. "Things have changed tremendously, I suppose?" he said.

"What is that shouting?" he asked abruptly.

"Nothing," said the thickset man impatiently. "It's people. You'll understand better later--perhaps.
As you say, things have changed." He spoke shortly, his brows were knit, and he glanced about
him like a man trying to decide in an emergency. "We must get you clothes and so forth, at
any rate. Better wait here until they can be procured. No one will come near you. You want
shaving."

Graham rubbed his chin.

The man with the flaxen beard came back towards them, turned suddenly, listened for a moment,
lifted his eyebrows at the older man, and hurried off through the archway towards the balcony.
The tumult of shouting grew louder, and the thickset man turned and listened also. He cursed
suddenly under his breath, and turned his eyes upon Graham with an unfriendly expression. It
was a surge of many voices, rising and falling, shouting and screaming, and once came a sound
like blows and sharp cries, and then a snapping like the crackling of dry sticks. Graham strained
his ears to draw some single thread of sound from the woven tumult.

Then he perceived, repeated again and again, a certain formula. For a time he doubted his ears.
But surely these were the words: "Show us the Sleeper! Show us the Sleeper!"

The thickset man rushed suddenly to the archway.

"Wild!" he cried. "How do they know? Do they know? Or is it guessing?"

There was perhaps an answer.

"I can't come," said the thickset man; "I have him to see to. But shout from the balcony."

There was an inaudible reply.

"Say he is not awake. Anything! I leave it to you."

He came hurrying back to Graham. "You must have clothes at once," he said. "You cannot stop
here--and it will be impossible to--"

He rushed away, Graham shouting unanswered questions after him. In a moment he was back.

"I can't tell you what is happening. It is too complex to explain. In a moment you shall have
your clothes made. Yes--in a moment. And then I can take you away from here. You will find
out our troubles soon enough."

"But those voices. They were shouting--?"

"Something about the Sleeper--that's you. They have some twisted idea. I don't know what it
is. I know nothing."

A shrill bell jetted acutely across the indistinct mingling of remote noises, and this brusque
person sprang to a little group of appliances in the corner of the room. He listened for a
moment, regarding a ball of crystal, nodded, and said a few indistinct words; then he walked
to the wall through which the two men had vanished. It rolled up again like a curtain, and
he stood waiting.

Graham lifted his arm and was astonished to find what strength the restoratives had given him.
He thrust one leg over the side of the couch and then the other. His head no longer swam. He
could scarcely credit his rapid recovery. He sat feeling his limbs.

The man with the flaxen beard re-entered from the archway, and as he did so the cage of a lift
came sliding down in front of the thickset man, and a lean, grey-bearded man, carrying a roll,
and wearing a tightly-fitting costume of dark green, appeared therein.

"This is the tailor," said the thickset man with an introductory gesture. "It will never do
for you to wear that black. I cannot understand how it got here. But I shall. I shall. You
will be as rapid as possible?" he said to the tailor. Of February, which Vladika from
Castelnuovo and besieged the city. On the same day reached the Russian Eskade under the command
of Captain Belli on. After five days of the siege demanded Vladika Belli and by the Austrian
commander to surrender the city and the surrender the keys of all bokel sized cities. He was
told, he was defending a foreign Land, for the period of the surrender of the Bocca at the
French had already been on 10 February expired. Markis Ghiselieri was finally with the Russian-Montenegrin
demands agree. He stepped off the Bokeler their land with eight large and small cities. The Austrian
crew has been replaced everywhere by the local army. [13]

Thus, given the Bokeler their country whole and free without much trouble and fights back. Otherwise
However, the issue of Bocca di Cattaro much more complicated and for the peace of Europe of
which threaten danger than ever.

3. Peter I and his relations with the superpowers.

To explain why the Vladika Peter at this time no further for the fight against the French entered
vigorously, one must learn to know his relations with the superpowers. Peter Petrovic Njegosch took
over the state administration after the death of his cousin, the Vladika Javva 1782nd There was
then an extremely difficult time for Montenegro. The danger of threatened the Ikadarsee ago, from the
Vizier of Ikadar Mahmut Pasha Buschatlia ..

[14] This was the Sultan become disloyal and prevailed in the Ikadarprovinz at its own caprice. As
a nightmare and a hell of a hostage he was regarded by all the neighbors and feared. The Montenegrin
Border was never quiet and safe from his clutches.

Vladika Peter, in view of the Pasha of Ikadar impending danger, decided in Russia Seek help.
He hoped much for his country on the orders of Ekaterina II, but the capricious Prince Potemkin,
he was expelled from St. Petersburg, within 24 hours, without being seen, the Empress have
to.

When in 1788 Russia and Austria with Turkey came into the war, sent both Houses, St. Petersburg
and Vienna, their messengers to Montenegro in order to Vladika for the war on to gain common enemy.
Joseph II wrote to the Vladika that he had no intention of to liberate the oppressed Christians
and turn them into participants of those benefits that ENJOY his subjects, he asked the Vladika
to participate in the war [15]. Ekaterina sent General-Lieutenant Tutolmin to Vladika, "so he gave
you," they wrote, [16] "Our imperial grace and benevolence of Our
insured, and if the faith that the unbelievers ignominy, when the
freedom they threaten and suppress ... You move with us participate
in the war against Christian enemies, he will (Tutolmin) arrange to
meet with you, regarding the arming of an army, it shall you give
your trust and convinced be that we never forget you, but always be
to ensure your safety.

"

Vladika Peter said his people are willing to follow the call of two courtyards. He did everything
possible to the Austrian General Vukasovic in its operations against the assist Turks from Montenegro.
With his troops and with all means at his Were available, he supported the Austrian army. For
this service, but he won neither during the war after the peace in Jasch any advantage for
his country, other than a mass of war material left behind for him, the Austrians, and the
he could do well in later battles against the Turks. Much more disadvantages he had to . Suffer
He retired that is to the resentment of the Turks, who now for revenge against Montenegro
sought to leave because of Russians and Austrians under the concluded peace was. After four years of fighting,
finally came up with a great battle between Montenegrins and Mahmut Pasha in the village Kruss
(1796), where the Montenegrins the most brilliant victory in their entire story helped. It fought
6000 30.000 Montenegrins against the Turks. Of these fell in the battle of 3000, including the
Pasha himself, his head still in Cetinje is kept as a trophy.

Since then the Turks, Montenegro left alone. Selim III. himself recognized
the independence Montenegro and testified in his letter. "Montenegro
has never been our Sublime Porte subject" [17] Very simple?"

"I suppose so," said Graham. "But about this cap--what was it?"

The man with the flaxen beard glanced over his shoulder.

"Here are your clothes!" he said. Graham turned round sharply and saw the tailor standing at
his elbow smiling, and holding some palpably new garments over his arm. The crop-headed boy,
by means of one ringer, was impelling the complicated machine towards the lift by which he
had arrived. Graham stared at the completed suit. "You don't mean to say--!"

"Just made," said the tailor. He dropped the garments at the feet of Graham, walked to the
bed, on which Graham had so recently been lying, flung out the translucent mattress, and turned
up the looking-glass. As he did so a furious bell summoned the thickset man to the corner.
The man with the flaxen beard rushed across to him and then hurried out by the archway.

The tailor was assisting Graham into a dark purple combination garment, stockings, vest, and
pants in one, as the thickset man came back from the corner to meet the man with the flaxen
beard returning from the balcony. They began speaking quickly in an undertone, their bearing
had an unmistakable quality of anxiety. Over the purple under-garment came a complex garment
of bluish white, and Graham, was clothed in the fashion once more and saw himself, sallow-faced,
unshaven and shaggy still, but at least naked no longer, and in some indefinable unprecedented
way graceful.

"I must shave," he said regarding himself in the glass.

"In a moment," said Howard.

The persistent stare ceased. The young man closed his eyes, reopened them, and with a lean
hand extended, advanced on Graham. Then he stopped, with his hand slowly gesticulating, and
looked about him.

"A seat," said Howard impatiently, and in a moment the flaxen-bearded man had a chair behind
Graham. "Sit down, please," said Howard.

Graham hesitated, and in the other hand of the wild-eyed man he saw the glint of steel.

"Don't you understand, Sire?" cried the flaxen-bearded man with hurried politeness. "He is
going to cut your hair."

"Oh!" cried Graham enlightened. "But you called him--"

"A capillotomist--precisely! He is one of the finest artists in the world."

Graham sat down abruptly. The flaxen-bearded man disappeared. The capillotomist came forward,
examined Graham's ears and surveyed him, felt the back of his head, and would have sat down
again to regard him but for Howard's audible impatience. Forthwith with rapid movements and
a succession of deftly handled implements he shaved Graham's chin, clipped his moustache, and
cut and arranged his hair. All this he did without a word, with something of the rapt air of
a poet inspired. And as soon as he had finished Graham was handed a pair of shoes.

Suddenly a loud voice shouted--it seemed from a piece of machinery in the corner--"At once--at
once. The people know all over the city. Work is being stopped. Work is being stopped. Wait
for nothing, but come."

This shout appeared to perturb Howard exceedingly. By his gestures it seemed to Graham that
he hesitated between two directions. Abruptly he went towards the corner where the apparatus
stood about the little crystal ball. As he did so the undertone of tumultuous shouting from
the archway that had continued during all these occurrences rose to a mighty sound, roared
as if it were sweeping past, and fell again as if receding swiftly. It drew Graham after it
with an irresistible attraction. He glanced at the thickset man, and then obeyed his impulse.
In two strides he was down the steps and in the passage, and in a score he was out upon the
balcony upon which the three men had been standing.

CHAPTER V

THE MOVING WAYS

He went to the railings of the balcony and stared upward. An exclamation of surprise at his
appearance, and the movements of a number of people came from the great area below.

His first impression was of overwhelming architecture. The place into which he looked was an
aisle of Titanic buildings, curving spaciously in either direction. Overhead mighty cantilevers
sprang together across the huge width of the place, and a tracery of translucent material shut
out the sky. Gigantic globes of cool white light shamed the pale sunbeams that filtered down
through the girders and wires. Here and there a gossamer suspension bridge dotted with foot
passengers flung across the chasm and the air was webbed with slender cables. A cliff of edifice
hung above him, he perceived as he glanced upward, and the opposite façade was grey and dim
and broken by great archings, circular perforations, balconies, buttresses, turret projections,
myriads of vast windows, and an intricate scheme of architectural relief. Athwart these ran
inscriptions horizontally and obliquely in an unfamiliar lettering. Here and there close to
the roof cables of a peculiar stoutness were fastened, and drooped in a steep curve to circular
openings on the opposite side of the space, and even as Graham noted these a remote and tiny
figure of a man clad in pale blue arrested his attention. This little figure was far overhead
across the space beside the higher fastening of one of these festoons, hanging forward from
a little ledge of masonry and handling some well-nigh invisible strings dependent from the
line. Then suddenly, with a swoop that sent Graham's heart into his mouth, this man had rushed
down the curve and vanished through a round opening on the hither side of the way. Graham had
been looking up as he came out upon the balcony, and the things he saw above and opposed to
him had at first seized his attention to the exclusion of anything else. Then suddenly he discovered
the roadway! It was not a roadway at all, as Graham understood such things, for in the nineteenth
century the only roads and streets were beaten tracks of motionless earth, jostling rivulets
of vehicles between narrow footways. But this roadway was three hundred feet across, and it
moved; it moved, all save the middle, the lowest part. For a moment, the motion dazzled his
mind. Then he understood. Under the balcony this extraordinary roadway ran swiftly to Graham's
right, an endless flow rushing along as fast as a nineteenth century express train, an endless
platform of narrow transverse overlapping slats with little interspaces that permitted it to
follow the curvatures of the street. Upon it were seats, and here and there little kiosks,
but they swept by too swiftly for him to see what might be therein. From this nearest and swiftest
platform a series of others descended to the centre of the space. Each moved to the right,
each perceptibly slower than the one above it, but the difference in pace was small enough
to permit anyone to step from any platform to the one adjacent, and so walk uninterruptedly
from the swiftest to the motionless middle way. Beyond this middle way was another series of
endless platforms rushing with varying pace to Graham's left. And seated in crowds upon the
two widest and swiftest platforms, or stepping from one to another down the steps, or swarming
over the central space, was an innumerable and wonderfully diversified multitude of people.

"You must not stop here," shouted Howard suddenly at his side. "You must come away at once."

Graham made no answer. He heard without hearing. The platforms ran with a roar and the people
were shouting. He soon penetrated to achieve and then me in the strongest
terms, to explain to him that brought these things here, and I cried and could not tell. But he did
not believe me, ordered me to stand up, and I had to search the whole house, but I found no one.
He demanded the keys to my office and looked through all my documents and letters, he found nothing.
A day came, I desperate tears. My husband left me very angry, and went to his laboratory. Tired,
I went back to bed and thought in tears after the incident the night, I could imagine no idea who
may have traded, and cursed as I am in a mirror, the world saw was my bed, My beauty unfortunate,
yes, I stretched out against me, against the disgust inside language, but unfortunately I was nice, I liked
making faces as I wanted. As I looked in the mirror, look for one of the new shoes that were
on the bedside tables, a paper. I came quickly after that and read the following note under
intense fear: Amelie loved! my misfortune is greater than ever, so
far we've had to avoid, and now I have to flee the country in which
you live, I stabbed an officer in the garrison in my duels, which
is your beneficiary, haunting me, I 'am Here, dressed in plain clothes.

Your birthday
is tomorrow, and must see you, see the last time. In the evening, near the gate you'll see me
in a small forest, including nuts, a hundred steps the road, the small chapel on the right. If you give
me some money can bring to my aid, so that God will repay.

I can not refrain from using the gate last few Louis d'or my property to the day birthday

We must be silent, you came, and my body is brought to your house tomorrow. you unhappy Ludewig.
I read these lines with the most violent pain;. I did see he had had to comfort her, I said
everything I had to bring what I had, because I loved him and would indescribable to lose it forever,
"Here, the mayor smiled and shook his head and said, responded with a quiet stranger Selbstgefuehl"
To achieve this, my lady, tenderly felt a strange man?

""

Yes, sir, but I blame too early, and quietly listen to my story.
We shot all day all I had money and jewelry together, and packed it
into a package that I'll be waiting on the evening of the maid Our
bath house in the area of ââbearing, to which I go Ludewig, lit.

This path was nothing remarkable, I was often left him.

When I arrived, I sent my maid back instructions to send me a new car to watch the bathhouse,
which was to take me home.

You left me, I went to the bathhouse, but went with my little package
under his arm at the gate forest where I was expected.

I rushed to the place called, I entered the chapel, flew into my arms, we have covered with kisses,
I melted into tears on the steps of the altar chapel, which was overshadowed by the nuts, we
sat with arms folded and told us stories in our recent tender caress. He almost desperate
that he never did tell me now, should not see again. The departure approached, she became half
past eight the watch, car ordered to wait. I gave money and jewels, and told me? Amelie, I would
have shot right before bed tonight, but your beauty sleep before me disarmed. Rebengelaender

I remembered I loved them when I put the new shoes and socks and got that what saved me evening
dry your man, honestly seemed to dream about his great idea, I have already seen yesterday, he met
me here in botanisierend forest was already dark, and I even ostrich You searched for wild flowers, he
I thought that was his equal, and I fell into a long conversation alchemical. I said instructions
by a monk, I am on my last trip to Provence, where we stayed at a convent, talked a lot about secret distillation
of a man living in a glass for chemical addition.


CHAPTER VI

THE HALL OF THE ATLAS

From the moment when the tailor had bowed his farewell to the moment when Graham found himself
in the lift, was altogether barely five minutes. As yet the haze of his vast interval of sleep
hung about him, as yet the initial strangeness of his being alive at all in this remote age
touched everything with wonder, with a sense of the irrational, with something of the quality
of a realistic dream. He was still detached, an astonished spectator, still but half involved
in life. What he had seen, and especially the last crowded tumult, framed in the setting of
the balcony, had a spectacular turn, like a thing witnessed from the box of a theatre. "I don't
understand," he said. "What was the trouble? My mind is in a whirl. Why were they shouting?
What is the danger?"

"We have our troubles," said Howard. His eyes avoided Graham's enquiry. "This is a time of
unrest. And, in fact, your appearance, your waking just now, has a sort of connexion--"

He spoke jerkily, like a man not quite sure of his breathing. He stopped abruptly.

"I don't understand," said Graham.

"It will be clearer later," said Howard.

He glanced uneasily upward, as though he found the progress of the lift slow.

"I shall understand better, no doubt, when I have seen my way about a little," said Graham
puzzled. "It will be--it is bound to be perplexing. At present it is all so strange. Anything
seems possible. Anything. In the details even. Your counting, I understand, is different."

The lift stopped, and they stepped out into a narrow but very long passage between high walls,
along which ran an extraordinary number of tubes and big cables.

"What a huge place this is!" said Graham. And already the church in front of me was
big and dark, wherein rested Mr. Gerhardus and his people. I heard the hammer strike in the tower
and the bells rang midnight down to the village.


"Several?"

"About fourteen."

"I don't understand."
