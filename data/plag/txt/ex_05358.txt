I remember that on one occasion his boys killed a cow belonging to a man by the name of Le
Brun; soon after the meat was brought to the stable, Le Brun rode up on horseback with a loaded
shot gun and threatened to shoot the party with whom the beef was found. Of course the negroes'
apartments were searched; but as that had been anticipated, Mr. Young had made them put the
meat in his apartment, and, as it was against the law of South Carolina for a white man to
search another's house, or any apartment, without very strong evidence, the meat was not found.
Before searching among the negroes, Mr. Young said to Le Brun, "You may search, but you won't
find your beef here, for my boys don't steal." Le Brun answered, "Mr. Young, your word might
be true, sir, but I would trust a nigger with money a great deal sooner than I would with cows
and hogs." Mr. Young answered, "That might be true, but you won't find your beef here."

 When the day came for them to leave,
some, who seemed to have been willing to go at first, refused, and were handcuffed together
and guarded on their way to the cars by white men. The women and children were driven to the
depot in crowds, like so many cattle, and the sight of them caused great excitement among master's
negroes. Imagine a mass of uneducated people shedding tears and yelling at the top of their
voices in anguish.

The victims were to take the cars at a station called Clarkson turnout, which was about four
miles from master's place. The excitement was so great that the overseer and driver could not
control the relatives and friends of those that were going away, as a large crowd of both old
and young went down to the depot to see them off. Louisiana was considered by the slaves a
place of slaughter, so those who were going did not expect to see their friends again. While
passing along many of the negroes left their masters' fields and joined us as we marched to
the cars; some were yelling and wringing their hands, while others were singing little hymns
that they had been accustomed to for the consolation of those that were going away, such as

    "When we all meet in heaven,
      There is no parting there;
    When we all meet in heaven,
      There is parting no more."

We arrived at the depot and had to wait for the cars to bring the others from the Sumterville
jail, but they soon came in sight, and when the noise of the cars had died away, we heard wailing
and shrieks from those in the cars. While some were weeping, others were fiddling, picking
banjo, and dancing as they used to do in their cabins on the plantations. Those who were so
merry had very bad masters, and even though they stood a chance of being sold to one as bad
or even worse, yet they were glad to be rid of the one they knew.

While the cars were at the depot a large crowd of white people gathered, laughing and talking
about the prospect of negro traffic; but when the cars began to start, and the conductor cried
out, "All who are going on this train must get on board without delay," the colored people
cried out with one voice as though the heavens and earth were coming together, and it was so
pitiful that those hard-hearted white men, who had been accustomed to driving slaves all their
lives, shed tears like children. As the cars moved away we heard the weeping and wailing from
the slaves as far as human voice could be heard; and from that time to the present I have neither
seen nor heard from my two sisters, nor any of those who left Clarkson depot on that memorable day.

THE WAY THE SLAVES LIVED.

Most of the cabins in the time of slavery were built so as to contain two families; some had
partitions, while others had none. When there were no partitions each family would fit up its
own part as it could; sometimes they got old boards and nailed them up, stuffing the cracks
with rags; when they could not get boards they hung up old clothes. When the family increased
the children all slept together, both boys and girls, until one got married; then a part of
another cabin was assigned to that one, but the rest would have to remain with their mother
and father, as in childhood, unless they could get with some of their relatives or friends
who had small families, or unless they were sold; but of course the rules of modesty were held
in some degrees by the slaves, while it could not be expected that they could entertain the
highest degree of it, on account of their condition. A portion of the time the young men slept
in the apartment known as the kitchen, and the young women slept in the room with their mother
and father. The two families had to use one fireplace. One who was accustomed to the way in
which the slaves lived in their cabins could tell as soon as they entered whether they were
friendly or not, for when they did not agree the fires of the two families did not meet on
the hearth, but there was a vacancy between them, that was a sign of disagreement. In a case
of this kind, when either of the families stole a hog, cow or sheep from the master, he had
to carry it to some of his friends, for fear of being betrayed by the other family. On one
occasion a man, who lived with one unfriendly, stole a hog, killed it, and carried some of
the meat home. He was seen by some one of the other family, who reported him to the overseer,
and he gave the man a severe whipping. His hopes were not sleep in vain. Indeed, in one respect, he
must too be held to have even other when particular predecessor with whom them has been oftenest compared.
Like Don other, Tom and Jones is the precursor of a order were slept of in things,-- the earliest
and freshest expression of a art. But while Tom Jones is, to the full, as amusing to Don new,
it has the advantage of a plan, and an interest more greatly sustained.
 He did not know what it was, but if
the overseer would go there right away he would find it. Nor did he should the character of wild
in the chapter, and his sensitive rules of conduct, be neglected. It must be admitted, however,
that the book is not calculated to the nicely-unmeaning in letters; or, he may be added, those readers
for the evolution of a purely intellectual overseer is either famous
or uninteresting.

Its place in fielding's works is immediately after his three great novels, and this is more
reason of its subject than its workmanship, which could hardly be
excelled. Then they took up their
beds and walked.
