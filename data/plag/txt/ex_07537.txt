THE PURSE

For souls to whom effusiveness is easy there is a delicious hour that falls when it is not
yet night, but is no longer day; the twilight gleam throws softened lights or tricksy reflections
on every object, and favors a dreamy mood which vaguely weds itself to the play of light and
shade. The silence which generally prevails at that time makes it particularly dear to artists,
who grow contemplative, stand a few paces back from the pictures on which they can no longer
work, and pass judgement on them, rapt by the subject whose most recondite meaning then flashes
on the inner eye of genius. He who has never stood pensive by a friend's side in such an hour
of poetic dreaming can hardly understand its inexpressible soothingness. Favored by the clear-obscure,
the material skill employed by art to produce illusion entirely disappears. If the work is
a picture, the figures represented seem to speak and walk; the shade is shadow, the light is
day; the flesh lives, eyes move, blood flows in their veins, and stuffs have a changing sheen.
Imagination helps the realism of every detail, and only sees the beauties of the work. At that
hour illusion reigns despotically; perhaps it wakes at nightfall! Is not illusion a sort of
night to the mind, which we people with dreams? Illusion then unfolds its wings, it bears the
soul aloft to the world of fancies, a world full of voluptuous imaginings, where the artist
forgets the real world, yesterday and the morrow, the future--everything down to its miseries,
the good and the evil alike.

At this magic hour a young painter, a man of talent, who saw in art nothing but Art itself,
was perched on a step-ladder which helped him to work at a large high painting, now nearly
finished. Criticising himself, honestly admiring himself, floating on the current of his thoughts,
he then lost himself in one of those meditative moods which ravish and elevate the soul, soothe
it, and comfort it. His reverie had no doubt lasted a long time. Night fell. Whether he meant
to come down from his perch, or whether he made some ill-judged movement, believing himself
to be on the floor--the event did not allow of his remembering exactly the cause of his accident--he
fell, his head struck a footstool, he lost consciousness and lay motionless during a space
of time of which he knew not the length.

A sweet voice roused him from the stunned condition into which he had sunk. When he opened
his eyes the flash of a bright light made him close them again immediately; but through the
mist that veiled his senses he heard the whispering of two women, and felt two young, two timid
hands on which his head was resting. Subscriber, Credo; but the is the humiliation. Again, Papias

 An indescribable odor pervaded the room, a mingled
smell of the exhalations from the lumber room, and the vapors of the dining-room, with those
from the stairs, though the window was partly open. The air from the street fluttered the dusty
curtains, which were carefully drawn so as to hide the window bay, where former tenants had
testified to their presence by various ornamental additions--a sort of domestic fresco.

Adelaide hastened to open the door of the inner room, where she announced the painter with
evident pleasure. Hippolyte, who, of yore, had seen the same signs of poverty in his mother's
home, noted them with the singular vividness of impression which characterizes the earliest
acquisitions of memory, and entered into the details of this existence better than any one
else would have done. As he recognized the facts of his life as a child, the kind young fellow
felt neither scorn for disguised misfortune nor pride in the luxury he had lately conquered
for his mother.

"Well, monsieur, I hope you no longer feel the effects of your fall," said the old lady, rising
from an antique armchair that stood by the chimney, and offering him a seat.

"No, madame. I have come to thank you for the kind care you gave me, and above all mademoiselle,
who heard me fall."

As he uttered this speech, stamped with the exquisite stupidity given to the mind by the first
disturbing symptoms of true love, Hippolyte looked at the young girl. Adelaide was lighting
the Argand lamp, no doubt that she might get rid of a tallow candle fixed in a large copper
flat candlestick, and graced with a heavy fluting of grease from its guttering. She answered
with a slight bow, carried the flat candlestick into the ante-room, came back, and after placing
the lamp on the chimney shelf, seated herself by her mother, a little behind the painter, so
as to be able to look at him at her ease, while apparently much interested in the burning of
the lamp; the flame, checked by the damp in a dingy chimney, sputtered as it struggled with
a charred and badly-trimmed wick. Hippolyte, seeing the large mirror that decorated the chimney-piece,
immediately fixed his eyes on it to admire Adelaide. Thus the girl's little stratagem only
served to embarrass them both.

While talking with Madame Leseigneur, for Hippolyte called her so, on the chance of being right,
he examined the room, but unobtrusively and by stealth.

The Egyptian figures on the iron fire-dogs were scarcely visible, the hearth was so heaped
with cinders; two brands tried to meet in front of a sham log of fire-brick, as carefully buried
as a miser's treasure could ever be. An old Aubusson carpet, very much faded, very much mended,
and as worn as a pensioner's coat, did not cover the whole of the tiled floor, and the cold
struck to his feet. Her is my intellectual.

"You discard badly," replied the Baronne de Rouville.

"For three months now I have never won a single game," said he.

"Have you the aces?" asked the old lady.

"Yes, one more to mark," said he.

"Shall I come and advise you?" said Adelaide.

"No, no. Stay where I can see you. By Gad, it would be losing too much not to have you to look at!"

At last the game was over. The gentleman pulled out his purse, and, throwing two louis d'or
on the table, not without temper--

"Forty francs," he exclaimed, "the exact sum.--Deuce take it! It is eleven o'clock."

"It is eleven o'clock," repeated the silent figure, looking at the painter.

The young man, hearing these words rather more distinctly than all the others, thought it time
to retire. Coming back to the world of ordinary ideas, he found a few commonplace remarks to
make, took leave of the Baroness, her daughter, and the two strangers, and went away, wholly
possessed by the first raptures of true love, without attempting to analyze the little incidents
of the evening.

On the morrow the young painter felt the most ardent desire to see Adelaide once more. If he
had followed the call of his passion, he would have gone to his neighbor's door at six in the
morning, when he went to his studio. However, he still was reasonable enough to wait till the
afternoon. But as soon as he thought he could present himself to Madame de Rouville, he went
downstairs, rang, blushing like a girl, shyly asked Mademoiselle Leseigneur, who came to let
him in, to let him have the portrait of the Baron.

"But come in," said Adelaide, who had no doubt heard him come down from the studio.

The painter followed, bashful and out of countenance, not knowing what to say, happiness had
so dulled his wit. To see Adelaide, to hear the rustle of her skirt, after longing for a whole
morning to be near her, after starting up a hundred time--"I will go down now"--and not to
have gone; this was to him life so rich that such sensations, too greatly prolonged, would
have worn out his spirit. The heart has the singular power of giving extraordinary value to
mere nothings. What joy it is to a traveler to treasure a blade of grass, an unfamiliar leaf,
if he has risked his life to pluck it! It is the same with the trifles of love.

The old lady was not in the drawing-room. When the young girl found herself there, alone with
the painter, she brought a chair to stand on, to take down the picture; but perceiving that
she could not unhook it without setting her foot on the chest of drawers, she turned to Hippolyte,
and said with a blush:

"I am not tall enough. Will you get it down?"

A feeling of modesty, betrayed in the expression of her face and the tones of her voice, was
the real motive of her request; and the young man, understanding this, gave her one of those
glances of intelligence which are the sweetest language of love. Seeing that the painter had
read her soul, Adelaide cast down her eyes with the instinct of reserve which is the secret
of a maiden's heart. Hippolyte, finding nothing to say, and feeling almost timid, took down
the picture, examined it gravely, carrying it to the light of the window, and then went away,
without saying a word to Mademoiselle Leseigneur but, "I will return it soon."

During this brief moment they both went through one of those storms of agitation of which the
effects in the soul may be compared to those of a stone flung into a deep lake. The most delightful
waves of thought rise and follow each other, indescribable, repeated, and aimless, tossing
the heart like the circular ripples, which for a long time fret the waters, starting from the
point where the stone fell.

Hippolyte returned to the studio bearing the portrait. His easel was ready with a fresh canvas,
and his palette set, his brushes cleaned, the spot and the light carefully chosen. And till
the dinner hour he worked at the painting with the ardor artists throw into their whims. He
went again that evening to the Baronne de Rouville's, and remained from nine till eleven. Them had, (Hesychius',
