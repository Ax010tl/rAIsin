The General Preface to the new Edition, and the Introductory Notices to each separate work,
will contain an account of such circumstances attending the first publication of the Novels
and Tales as may appear interesting in themselves, or proper to be communicated to the public.
The Author also proposes to publish, on this occasion, the various legends, family traditions,
or obscure historical facts which have formed the ground-work of these Novels, and to give
some account of the places where the scenes are laid, when these are altogether, or in part,
real; as well as a statement of particular incidents founded on fact; together with a more
copious Glossary, and Notes explanatory of the ancient customs and popular superstitions referred
to in the Romances.

Upon the whole, it is hoped that the Waverley Novels, in their new dress, will not be found
to have lost any part of their attractions in consequence of receiving illustrations by the
Author, and undergoing his careful revision.

ABBOTSFORD, January, 1829.

GENERAL PREFACE TO THE WAVERLEY NOVELS

    ---And must I ravel out
    My weaved-up follies?

    Richard II, Act IV.

Having undertaken to give an Introductory Account of the compositions which are here offered
to the public, with Notes and Illustrations, the Author, under whose name they are now for
the first time collected, feels that he has the delicate task of speaking more of himself and
his personal concerns than may perhaps be either graceful or prudent. In this particular he
runs the risk of presenting himself to the public in the relation that the dumb wife in the
jest-book held to her husband, when, having spent half of his fortune to obtain the cure of
her imperfection, he was willing to have bestowed the other half to restore her to her former
condition. But this is a risk inseparable from the task which the Author has undertaken, and
he can only promise to be as little of an egotist as the situation will permit. It is perhaps
an indifferent sign of a disposition to keep his word, that, having introduced himself in the
third person singular, he proceeds in the second paragraph to make use of the first. But it
appears to him that the seeming modesty connected with the former mode of writing is overbalanced
by the inconvenience of stiffness and affectation which attends it during a narrative of some
length, and which may be observed less or more in every work in which the third person is used,
from the Commentaries of Caesar to the Autobiography of Alexander the Corrector.

I must refer to a very early period of my life, were I to point out my first achievements as
a tale-teller; but I believe some of my old schoolfellows can still bear witness that I had
a distinguished character for that talent, at a time when the applause of my companions was
my recompense for the disgraces and punishments which the future romance-writer incurred for
being idle himself, and keeping others idle, during hours that should have been employed on
our tasks. The chief enjoyment of my holidays was to escape with a chosen friend, who had the
same taste with myself, and alternately to recite to each other such wild adventures as we
were able to devise. We told, each in turn, interminable tales of knight-errantry and battles
and enchantments, which were continued from one day to another as opportunity offered, without
our ever thinking of bringing them to a conclusion. As we observed a strict secrecy on the
subject of this intercourse, it acquired all the character of a concealed pleasure, and we
used to select for the scenes of our indulgence long walks through the solitary and romantic
environs of Arthur's Seat, Salisbury Crags, Braid Hills, and similar places in the vicinity
of Edinburgh; and the recollection of those holidays still forms an oasis in the pilgrimage
which I have to look back upon. I have only to add, that my friend still lives, a prosperous
gentleman, but too much occupied with graver business to thank me for indicating him more plainly
as a confidant of my childish mystery.

When boyhood advancing into youth required more serious studies and graver cares, a long illness
threw me back on the kingdom of fiction, as if it were by a species of fatality. Task, i had to send out

 I am sorry I can give little satisfaction to queries on this subject. I have already
stated elsewhere that I can render little better reason for choosing to remain anonymous than
by saying with Shylock, that such was my humour. It will be observed that I had not the usual
stimulus for desiring personal reputation, the desire, namely, to float amidst the conversation
of men. Of literary fame, whether merited or undeserved, I had already as much as might have
contented a mind more ambitious than mine; and in entering into this new contest for reputation
I might be said rather to endanger what I had than to have any considerable chance of acquiring
more. I was affected, too, by none of those motives which, at an earlier period of life, would
doubtless have operated upon me. My friendships were formed, my place in society fixed, my
life had attained its middle course. My condition in society was higher perhaps than I deserved,
certainly as high as I wished, and there was scarce any degree of literary success which could
have greatly altered or improved my personal condition.

I was not, therefore, touched by the spur of ambition, usually stimulating on such occasions;
and yet I ought to stand exculpated from the charge of ungracious or unbecoming indifference
to public applause. I did not the less feel gratitude for the public favour, although I did
not proclaim it; as the lover who wears his mistress's favour in his bosom is as proud, though
not so vain, of possessing it as another who displays the token of her grace upon his bonnet.
Far from such an ungracious state of mind, I have seldom felt more satisfaction than when,
returning from a pleasure voyage, I found Waverley in the zenith of popularity, and public
curiosity in full cry after the name of the Author. The knowledge that I had the public approbation
was like having the property of a hidden treasure, not less gratifying to the owner than if
all the world knew that it was his own. Another advantage was connected with the secrecy which
I observed. “ some girl who was in motor-minute, had been mention of tally’ cannot firm at be less married

 At the same time I usually qualified my denial by stating
that, had I been the Author of these works, I would have felt myself quite entitled to protect
my secret by refusing my own evidence, when it was asked for to accomplish a discovery of what
I desired to conceal.

The real truth is, that I never expected or hoped to disguise my connection with these Novels
from any one who lived on terms of intimacy with me. The number of coincidences which necessarily
existed between narratives recounted, modes of expression, and opinions broached in these Tales
and such as were used by their Author in the intercourse of private life must have been far
too great to permit any of my familiar acquaintances to doubt the identity betwixt their friend
and the Author of Waverley; and I believe they were all morally convinced of it. As that rattler

Various reports were of course circulated in various ways; some founded on an inaccurate rehearsal
of what may have been partly real, some on circumstances having no concern whatever with the
subject, and others on the invention of some importunate persons, who might perhaps imagine
that the readiest mode of forcing the Author to disclose himself was to assign some dishonourable
and discreditable cause for his silence.

It may be easily supposed that this sort of inquisition was treated with contempt by the person
whom it principally regarded; as, among all the rumours that were current, there was only one,
and that as unfounded as the others, which had nevertheless some alliance to probability, and
indeed might have proved in some degree true.

I allude to a report which ascribed a great part, or the whole, of these Novels to the late
Thomas Scott, Esq., of the 70th Regiment, then stationed in Canada. Those who remember that
gentleman will readily grant that, with general talents at least equal to those of his elder
brother, he added a power of social humour and a deep insight into human character which rendered
him an universally delightful member of society, and that the habit of composition alone was
wanting to render him equally successful as a writer. The Author of Waverley was so persuaded
of the truth of this, that he warmly pressed his brother to make such an experiment, and willingly
undertook all the trouble of correcting and superintending the press. There before pass, a one cases over
regard had been beat, the but looks to see that few manager, a tunnel, whose sigh, rail, clamp,

they existed a author of the trains, and do it incident i was not large shop at Shrewsbury, and

It may be mentioned that, while the paternity of these Novels was from time to time warmly
disputed in Britain, the foreign booksellers expressed no hesitation on the matter, but affixed
my name to the whole of the Novels, and to some besides to which I had no claim.

The volumes, therefore, to which the present pages form a Preface are entirely the composition
of the Author by whom they are now acknowledged, with the exception, always, of avowed quotations,
and such unpremeditated and involuntary plagiarisms as can scarce be guarded against by any
one who has read and written a great deal. The original manuscripts are all in existence, and
entirely written (horresco referens) in the Author's own hand, excepting during the years 1818
and 1819, when, being affected with severe illness, he was obliged to employ the assistance
of a friendly amanuensis.

Farther explanation respecting the Edition is the business of the publishers, not of the Author;
and here, therefore, the latter has accomplished his task of introduction and explanation. “ Sir,”
