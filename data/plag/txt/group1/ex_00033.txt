   We are the inheritors of the knowledge and skill
of all the daughters of Eve in all that concerns its use since the beginning of time.

When this small implement came open-eyed into the world it brought with it possibilities of
well-being and comfort for races and ages to come. It has been an instrument of beneficence
as long ago as "Dorcas sewed garments and gave them to the poor," and has been a creator of
beauty since Sisera gave to his mother "a prey of needlework, 'alike on both sides.'" This
little descriptive phrase--alike on both sides--will at once suggest to all needlewomen a perfection
of method almost without parallel. Of course it can be done, but the skill of it must have
been rare, even in those far-off days of leisure when duties and pleasures did not crowd out
painstaking tasks, and every art was carried as far as human assiduity and invention could
carry it.

A history of the needlework of the world would be a history of the domestic accomplishment
of the world, that inner story of the existence of man which bears the relation to him of sunlight
to the plant. We can deduce from these needle records much of the physical circumstances of
woman's long pilgrimage down the ages, of her mental processes, of her growth in thought. We
can judge from the character of her art whether she was at peace with herself and the world,
and from its status we become aware of its relative importance to the conditions of her life.

There are few written records of its practice and growth, for an art which does not affect
the commercial gain of a land or country is not apt to have a written or statistical history,
but, fortunately in this case, the curious and valuable specimens which are left to us tell
their own story. They reveal the cultivation and amelioration of domestic life. Their contribution
to the refinements are their very existence.

A history of any domestic practice which has grown into a habit marks the degree of general
civilization, but the practice of needlework does more. To a careful student each small difference
in the art tells its own story in its own language. The hammered gold of Eastern embroidery
tells not only of the riches of available material, but of the habit of personal preparation,
instead of the mechanical. The little Bible description of captured "needlework alike on both
sides" speaks unmistakably of the method of their stitchery, a cross-stitch of colored threads,
which is even now the only method of stitch "alike on both sides."

It is an endless and fascinating story of the leisure of women in all ages and circumstances,
written in her own handwriting of painstaking needlework and an estimate of an art to which
gold, silver, and precious stones--the treasures of the world--were devoted. More than this,
its intimate association with the growth and well-being of family life makes visible the point
where savagery is left behind and the decrees of civilization begin.

I knew a dear Bible-nourished lonely little maid who had constructed for herself a drama of
Eve in Eden, playing it for the solitary audience of self in a corner of the garden. She had
brought all manner of fruits and had tied them to the fence palings under the apple boughs.
This little Eve gathered grape leaves and sewed them carefully into an apron, the needle holes
pierced with a thorn and held together by fiber stripped from long-stemmed plantain leaves.
Here she and her audience of self hid under the apple boughs and waited for the call of the Lord.

The long ministry of the needle to the wants of mankind proves it to have been among the first
of man's inventions. When Eve sewed fig leaves she probably improvised some implement for the
process, and every daughter of Eve, from Eden to the present time, has been indebted to that
little implement for expression of herself in love and duty and art. For this we must thank
the man who, the Bible relates, was "the father of all such as worked in metals, and made needles
and gave them to his household." He is the first "handy man" mentioned in history--blest be
his memory!

If the day should ever come, not, let us hope, in our time or that of our children, when the
manufacturer shall find that it no longer pays to make needles, what value will attach to individual
specimens! If they were only to be found in occasional bric-à-brac shops or in the collections
of some far-seeing hoarder of rarities, it would be difficult to overrate the interest which
might attach to them. How, from the prodigal disregard of ages and the mysteries of the past,
would emerge, one after another, recovered specimens, to be examined and judged and classified
and arranged!

Perhaps collections of them will be found in future museums under different headings, such as:

"Needles of Consolation," under which might come those which Mary Stuart and her maids wrought
their dismal hours into pathetic bits of embroidery during the long days of captivity, or the
daughter of the sorrowful Marie Antoinette mended the dilapidations of the pitiful and ragged
Dauphin; or:

"Needles of Devotion," wielded by canonized and uncanonized saints in and out of nunneries; or:

"Needles of History," like those with which Matilda stitched the prowess of William the Conqueror
into breadths of woven flax.

Possibly there may arise needle experts who, upon microscopic examination and scientific test,
will refer all specimens to positive date and peculiar function, and by so doing let in floods
of light upon ancient customs and habits. It is idle to speculate upon a condition which does
not yet exist, for, happily, needles for actual hand sewing are yet in sufficient demand to
allow us to indulge in their purchase quite ungrudgingly.

I was once shown a needle--it was in Constantinople--which the dark-skinned owner declared
had been treasured for three hundred years in his family, and he affirmed it so positively
and circumstantially that I accepted the statement as truth. In fact, what did it matter? It
was an interesting lie or an interesting truth, whichever one might consider it, and the needle
looked quite capable of sustaining another century or so of family use. Its eye was a polished
triangular hole made to carry strips of beaten metal, exactly such as we read of in the Bible
as beaten and cut into strips for embroidery upon linen, such embroidery, in fact, as has often
been burned in order to sift the pure gold from its ashes.

Not only the history, but the poetry and song of all periods are starred with real and ideal
embroideries--noble and beautiful ladies, whose chief occupations seem to have been the medicining
of wounds received in their honor or defense, or the broidering of scarfs and sleeves with
which to bind the helmets of their knights as they went forth to tourney or to battle. In these
old chronicles the knights fought or made music with harp or voice, and the women ministered
or made embroidery, and so pictured lives which were lived in the days of knights and ladies
drifted on. The sword and the needle expressed the duties, the spirit, and the essence of their
several lives. The men were militant, the women domestic, and wherever in castle or house or
nunnery the lives of women were made safe by the use of the sword the needle was devoting itself
to comforts of clothing for the poor and dependent, or luxuries of adornment for the rich and
powerful. So the needle lived on through all the civilizations of the old world, in the various
forms which they developed, until it was finally inherited by pilgrims to a new world, and
was brought with them to the wilderness of America.

CHAPTER I -- BEGINNINGS IN THE NEW WORLD

The history of embroidery in America would naturally begin with the advent of the Pilgrim Mothers,
if one ignored the work of native Indians. This, however, would be unfair to a primitive art,
which accomplished, with perfect appropriateness to use and remarkable adaptation of circumstance
and material, the ornamentation of personal apparel.

The porcupine quill embroidery of American Indian women is unique among the productions of
primitive peoples, and some of the dresses, deerskin shirts, and moccasins with borders and
flying designs in black, red, blue, and shining white quills, and edged with fringes hung with
the teeth and claws of game, or with beautiful small shells, are as truly objects of art as
are many things of the same decorative intent produced under the best conditions of civilization.

To create beauty with the very limited resources of skins, hair, teeth, and quills of animals,
colored with the expressed juice of plants, was a problem very successfully solved by these
dwellers in the wilderness, and the results were practically and æsthetically valuable.
