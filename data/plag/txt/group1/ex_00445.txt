The heart-burning which these reflections occasioned proved very indifferent seasoning to the
dry antiquarian discussions with which Oldbuck, who continued to demand his particular attention,
was unremittingly persecuting him; and he underwent, with fits of impatience that amounted
almost to loathing, a course of lectures upon monastic architecture, in all its styles, from
the massive Saxon to the florid Gothic, and from that to the mixed and composite architecture
of James the First's time, when, according to Oldbuck, all orders were confounded, and columns
of various descriptions arose side by side, or were piled above each other, as if symmetry
had been forgotten, and the elemental principles of art resolved into their primitive confusion.
"What can be more cutting to the heart than the sight of evils," said Oldbuck, in rapturous
enthusiasm, "which we are compelled to behold, while we do not possess the power of remedying
them?" Lovel answered by an involulatary groan. "I see, my dear young friend, and most congenial
spirit, that you feel these enormities almost as much as I do. Have you ever approached them,
or met them, without longing to tear, to deface, what is so dishonourable?"

"Dishonourable!" echoed Lovel—"in what respect dishonourable?"

"I mean, disgraceful to the arts."

"Where? how?"

"Upon the portico, for example, of the schools of Oxford, where, at immense expense, the barbarous,
fantastic, and ignorant architect has chosen to represent the whole five orders of architecture
on the front of one building."

By such attacks as these, Oldbuck, unconscious of the torture he was giving, compelled Lovel
to give him a share of his attention,—as a skilful angler, by means of his line, maintains
an influence over the most frantic movements of his agonized prey.

They were now on their return to the spot where they had left the carriages; and it is inconceivable
how often, in the course of that short walk, Lovel, exhausted by the unceasing prosing of his
worthy companion, mentally bestowed on the devil, or any one else that would have rid him of
hearing more of them, all the orders and disorders of architecture which had been invented
or combined from the building of Solomon's temple downwards. A slight incident occurred, however,
which sprinkled a little patience on the heat of his distemperature.

Miss Wardour, and her self-elected knight companion, rather preceded the others in the narrow
path, when the young lady apparently became desirous to unite herself with the rest of the
party, and, to break off her tete-a-tete with the young officer, fairly made a pause until
Mr. Oldbuck came up. "I wished to ask you a question, Mr. Oldbuck, concerning the date of these
interesting ruins."

It would be doing injustice to Miss Wardour's savoir faire, to suppose she was not aware that
such a question would lead to an answer of no limited length. The Antiquary, starting like
a war-horse at the trumpet sound, plunged at once into the various arguments for and against
the date of 1273, which had been assigned to the priory of St. Ruth by a late publication on
Scottish architectural antiquities. He raked up the names of all the priors who had ruled the
institution, of the nobles who had bestowed lands upon it, and of the monarchs who had slept
their last sleep among its roofless courts. As a train which takes fire is sure to light another,
if there be such in the vicinity, the Baronet, catching at the name of one of his ancestors
which occurred in Oldbuck's disquisition, entered upon an account of his wars, his conquests,
and his trophies; and worthy Dr. Blattergowl was induced, from the mention of a grant of lands,
cum decimis inclusis tam vicariis quam garbalibus, et nunquan antea separatis, to enter into
a long explanation concerning the interpretation given by the Teind Court in the consideration
of such a clause, which had occurred in a process for localling his last augmentation of stipend.
The orators, like three racers, each pressed forward to the goal, without much regarding how
each crossed and jostled his competitors. Mr. Oldbuck harangued, the Baronet declaimed, Mr.
Blattergowl prosed and laid down the law, while the Latin forms of feudal grants were mingled
with the jargon of blazonry, and the yet more barbarous phraseology of the Teind Court of Scotland.
"He was," exclaimed Oldbuck, speaking of the Prior Adhemar, "indeed an exemplary prelate; and,
from his strictness of morals, rigid execution of penance, joined to the charitable disposition
of his mind, and the infirmities endured by his great age and ascetic habits"—

Here he chanced to cough, and Sir Arthur burst in, or rather continued—"was called popularly
Hell-in-Harness; he carried a shield, gules with a sable fess, which we have since disused,
and was slain at the battle of Vernoil, in France, after killing six of the English with his own"—

"Decreet of certification," proceeded the clergyman, in that prolonged, steady, prosing tone,
which, however overpowered at first by the vehemence of competition, promised, in the long
run, to obtain the ascendancy in this strife of narrators;—"Decreet of certification having
gone out, and parties being held as confessed, the proof seemed to be held as concluded, when
their lawyer moved to have it opened up, on the allegation that they had witnesses to bring
forward, that they had been in the habit of carrying the ewes to lamb on the teind-free land;
which was a mere evasion, for"—

But here the, Baronet and Mr. Oldbuck having recovered their wind, and continued their respective
harangues, the three strands of the conversation, to speak the language of a rope-work, were
again twined together into one undistinguishable string of confusion.

Yet, howsoever uninteresting this piebald jargon might seem, it was obviously Miss Wardour's
purpose to give it her attention, in preference to yielding Captain M'Intyre an opportunity
of renewing their private conversation. So that, after waiting for a little time with displeasure,
ill concealed by his haughty features, he left her to enjoy her bad taste, and taking his sister
by the arm, detained her a little behind the rest of the party.

"So I find, Mary, that your neighbour has neither become more lively nor less learned during
my absence."

"We lacked your patience and wisdom to instruct us, Hector."

"Thank you, my dear sister. But you have got a wiser, if not so lively an addition to your
society, than your unworthy brother—Pray, who is this Mr. Lovel, whom our old uncle has at
once placed so high in his good graces?—he does not use to be so accessible to strangers."

"Mr. Lovel, Hector, is a very gentleman-like young man."

"Ay,—that is to say, he bows when he comes into a room, and wears a coat that is whole at the
elbows."

"No, brother; it says a great deal more. It says that his manners and discourse express the
feelings and education of the higher class."
