"Ay, who indeed?" said Reuben warmly.  "And now," he added, "I want a bit of advice, sir, from
you, for it ain't all grass and gravel with me now; there's some deepish ruts and some stony
roads before me, and that's why I were so anxious to stop you just now, sir, that I might tell
you all about it, and get a word or two from yourself to give us a bit of encouragement."

"I am truly thankful--I can't tell you how thankful," replied the young man.  "The Lord has
indeed done great things for you, and I shall be only too happy to be helpful to you in any
way that I can."

"Thank you, sir, kindly; 'tain't worldly help as I wants from you.  I've earned enough for
me and Sally to last us as long as we live; and it's almost time as I sold the old van, and
settled down somewheres for the rest of my days.  But it's just this, sir--I want to do some
work for the Lord, who's been and done so much for Sally and me.  Now I could, as I said just
now, sell the old van and settle down; but then I mightn't be able to do much good, and my
old limbs would get stiff for want of my regular exercise, and I should just be snoozing away
the rest of my time in a big arm-chair.  Now I ain't quite used up, nor Sally neither.  So
I could keep on the move from place to place, dropping a word for Christ here, and a word there,
where I've been used to drop scores of words for the devil; and if you'd put me in the way,
I could take a lot of Testaments and other good books with me, and sell 'em instead of the
poisonous trash as I used to carry.  Now, what do you advise me?"

"You couldn't do better, old friend," replied Horace; "you would be showing then your colours,
and doing real work for the Master--better far than you could if you settled down."

"Well, I think so too, sir; and you must know that I've begun to do a bit for the Lord already,
though in a poor sort of way.  I used to sell smuggled goods on the sly, and bad songs and
bad books, but I've dropped all that now.  You may look my van through, drawers and cupboards
and all, every corner of it, and you'll not find a scrap of the bad sort now.  Eh!  How some
of my old customers do stare, and how some on 'em do jeer, when I tells 'em as I've done selling
the old things as they delight in.  But it don't matter.  I've made up my mind, and they're
beginning to find that out.  They call me an old humbug, and tell me as Sally and I shall end
our days in the Union.  But I ain't afeard; it ain't the likes of them as can send me there,
and I know I'm safe in the Lord's hands."

"That's very true," said Horace; "you'll be taken good care of while you are in the path of
duty, and you will have many a noble opportunity of helping on the good cause as you go from
place to place.  Many will get a word from you which they might not be in the way of hearing
otherwise, and the very fact of such a change in the hearts and lives of your wife and yourself
must tell on the consciences of many who see what you are now and know what you were in times
past."

"I believe you sir," said the old man.  "Now, there's one who's been touched already--Jim Grimes,
who keeps `The Old Fighting-Cocks' at Bridgepath.  He were mightily surprised at first when
he seed as I'd given up my old ways; he wouldn't believe as it were the true thing, and he
were for chaffing me out of it.  But he found out after a bit as I was real.  'Tain't for me
to boast--it were the Lord's doings, not mine--but when he came to be persuaded as I had taken
to the better way in earnest, he couldn't make it out at first; but now he has come to set
his feet on the right road, too, I trust, and this has made me think as there's work for the
Lord for me to do in a quiet way without giving up the van--in a quiet way, I say, sir, for
I don't want to be put in a `mag.'"

CHAPTER ELEVEN.

A SURPRISE.

Mr Horace Jackson has completed his twenty-first year, and the day is to be marked by a grand
gathering in the grounds in front of Park House. The persons invited on the occasion were all
the tenants on the estate, the two Misses Stansfield, and Lady Willerly and her daughter. 
Ruby Grigg also and his wife Sally were present by special invitation.

The colonel had never formally declared that his nephew was to be his heir, though it had been
generally understood that such was to be the case.  And now the proceedings at Riverton Park
were to be of so quiet a character, that people began to question whether after all this celebration
of the young man's coming of age might not merely be an ordinary keeping of the majority of
one who might not in the end turn out to be the real heir to the property.  Such was the conjecture
of the public as the preparations were watched and commented upon.  "And yet who can tell?"
exclaimed ungratified curiosity reproachfully, "for the colonel never does anything like other
people."  There was, however, one person who was abundantly satisfied, and that was old John
Price; but nothing could be got from him, though a host of questioners assailed him as he made
his way down to the house, on the morning of the birthday gathering, seated on an old pony
as prudent and impenetrable as himself.

It was a glorious day, and, after a hearty noonday meal, all the guests were collected on the
lawn in front of the mansion.  The colonel, his sister, and their nephew, having dined with
the company, now occupied the centre of a group which had gathered on the steps of Park House,
consisting of the ladies invited and old John Price.  Scarce a sound was heard but the rustling
of the leaves of some of the noble trees, as all sat waiting for what was to come next, for
certainly something special was expected by all, though they could scarce have told why.  At
last the colonel stood forward, and, raising his hat from his venerable head, just closed his
eyes for a moment and murmured a few words to himself and then, his voice trembling at first
with emotion, spoke as follows--

"My dear friends, I am about to bring strange things to your ears, but I trust not disagreeable
ones.  And first of all, let me introduce to you, under a new name, Mr Horace Walters, the
only son and only child of your late squire, and the present and, I trust for many happy years
to come, future proprietor of the Riverton estate."

He paused as the whole company rose to their feet and vociferously cheered the young master.
Looks of astonishment and perplexity were then exchanged by many as they resumed their seats,
but these soon gave place to most earnest attention to Colonel Dawson, who thus proceeded--

"You may some of you be wondering, dear friends, how I can have permitted your dear young squire
to have assumed and carried with my sanction a name among you that is not really his own; but
I shall soon show you what will, I am sure, be perfectly satisfactory to you all on this point.
What I am now going to tell you is not a mere tale to gratify curiosity.  I have a sacred duty
to perform in telling it; for it was the earnest request that I should do so of one who had
a right to claim it of me--I mean your late squire, the father of my dear young friend here,
whom I shall never cease to call my dear nephew.

"You must know, then, that some twenty-five years have now passed since I retired from the
army.  I was living at that time in a quiet way in my native county, when a cousin of mine,
who used to be my special companion and friend when we were boys, died, and left me, to my
considerable surprise, a large property in Australia, in which country he had been living for
many years as an extensive sheep-farmer. Believing that property has its duties as well as
its profits, I resolved to go over and see what my new acquisition was like, and what I had
best do with it.  I had no thoughts at first of settling in the colony.  But I found when I
got there a great deal to do and a great deal to undo before things could be set properly in
order; and by the time I had got things into shape I had got so used to colonial life, and
so well satisfied with its freedom from many of those fetters which society imposes on us in
many of her usages in the old mother country, that I made up my mind to settle, for a time
at any rate, in my adopted land.

  Horace had learned to call me uncle, and I to call him and speak of him as nephew:
and though friends and neighbours at first perfectly understood that this was only a loving
mode of address, not at all intended to deceive anybody, yet in process of time it became so
completely a matter of course with us, that we can hardly either of us believe that this relationship
does not really exist between us, and so I shall be `Uncle Dawson' to him, and he will be `Nephew
Horace' to me till death parts us.  Horace was now seven years old, and I felt only too thankful
to mark in him the evidences of a real love to that Saviour whom his good old nurse had taught
him to know and serve in his childish way.  And so the boy was twining himself tight round
my heart, and, to tell the honest truth, I began to dread the father's return, and almost to
hope he might never come back to claim his child.

"It was one beautiful day in February.  You must remember, dear friends, that February is one
of our hot months in the southern hemisphere. Horace was at school, and I was sitting by an
open window in my private room, which looked on to the garden at the back of my town house.
Something came between me and the light.  I looked up from my writing. A man stood by the open
window, and did not move away as he saw my eyes fixed on him.  He wore a broad palm leaf hat,
which rather shaded from my view his full features; but I could see a noble countenance, which
was rendered strikingly picturesque by the profusion of beard and moustache, which had evidently
been long untrimmed.  His upper clothing consisted of a faded blouse, fastened round the neck
by a black silk handkerchief.  He had also coarse duck trousers on, bound round his waist by
a leathern belt, and well-made boots on his feet, which were remarkably small for one of his
robust make.

"My heart sank within me for a moment or two, for I divined at once who he must be; but, recovering
myself, I asked him if he wished to speak with me.  `Yes; he should be glad to do so,' he replied
in a sad voice, but with the greatest courtesy of manner.

"He was soon seated opposite to me, and came at once to the point by saying, `How can I ever
discharge my debt of gratitude to you, Colonel Dawson, for your most generous treatment of
my poor boy, who might have been lost or ruined but for your kindness?'

"`Pray, don't say anything more on the subject, Mr Jackson,' I replied. `It has been a happiness
to me to have been led to befriend your child; and, indeed, he has become so dear to me, that
I know not how to part with him.  But, of course, as he is yours, not mine, you are at liberty
to take him when you will, or to leave him with me till you can provide a settled home for him.'

"My visitor was greatly moved, and grasped my hand most warmly.  `I know,' he said, `the best
recompense I can make to one who has acted towards me as you have done, is to lay myself under
still deeper obligation to you; and I will do so.  I may tell you thus much about myself--I
am not what I seem.  I have a great object which I am seeking to accomplish, and I am, I think,
on the road to success.  I shall be most thankful to leave my boy in your hands, at any rate,
for the present, and shall be most happy to charge myself with all his expenses at home and
at school.'

"`Nay, Mr Jackson,' I replied; `while he remains with me it shall be my privilege to supply
him with all that he needs, as I can well afford to do, and I shall be further truly happy
to be of personal service to yourself if I can.'

"`I accept your offer with gratitude,' he replied.  `You can help me, I dare say.  I want employment
as a clerk or book-keeper.  Dare you trust me yourself, or dare you recommend me to another?
I dare myself affirm that I will not disappoint an employer who may trust me.'

"There was a frankness and sincerity in his manner which completely disarmed me of all suspicion
or hesitation; whatever colonial prudence might suggest, I could not distrust him.  So I offered
him at once a place in my own office with a moderate stipend.  He accepted it without hesitation,
and lived in my house as a member of the family; and never did employer have a more intelligent
and faithful worker.  As for the child, his father never in the least interfered with my management
of him, though I brought him up after my own utterly unfashionable, or perhaps more properly
speaking, old-fashioned ideas.  On the contrary, he warmly approved of my system.

"`I cannot tell you,' he said one day, soon after he had come to live with me, `how truly grateful
I am to see you forming my dear boy's character in the way you are doing.  I want him to be
the very opposite to what I was myself at his age, and to what the generality of children are
now.  I was brought up just to please myself and to have my own way--to be, in fact, a little
incarnation of self-will and selfishness. I was allowed to ask for everything I liked at the
table, no restriction being put upon my self-indulgence.  I went where I liked, and did what
I liked, and was never checked except when I was in the way, or had become intolerably troublesome.
I was placed under no regular discipline, and was allowed to thrust myself and my opinions
forward amongst my seniors and those who were my superiors in everything but worldly position;
and as I grew older, and became inconveniently self-asserting, I was alternately snubbed and
humoured according to the whim or temper of those who claimed authority over me.  And what
was the result?  Alas! Early reckless extravagance followed by ruin, and a character which
might have been moulded into something noble, now for a long time shapeless and distorted.
And my boy--well, I am only too thankful that he has fallen into your hands out of his unworthy
father's.'  He spoke these words with deep emotion.

"`I am truly glad, Mr Jackson,' I said, `that you are able to look at things in this better
and clearer light.  I quite agree with you about the present bringing up of children.  For
a few years they are treated as little idols by parents, who are too selfish to give themselves
the pain and trouble of correcting and disciplining them, and this, too, even in cases where
the parents themselves are true Christians; and then, when they begin to get unbearable, and
have passed out of the winning ways of early childhood, they are too often thrown back upon
themselves, and made to suffer the penalty of neglect of discipline and training, which ought
properly to be inflicted on the parents, who have not done their duty towards them.'

"`It is so.  I have seen it; I have felt it, Colonel Dawson,' he replied warmly; `and so I
just leave Horace's education entirely in your hands.'

"And thus it was that I brought up my dear nephew, as I still continued to call him, in my
own way--that is to say, to eat what was given him, to do what was told him, to go where I
allowed him, and to have as much liberty as I thought good for him; to listen when his elders
were speaking, to be diligent in his lessons, early in his hours of rising and going to bed,
and regular in all his habits.  And he will tell you himself, I don't doubt, as he has told
me over and over again, that, so far from feeling this discipline and these wholesome restraints
a bondage, he was as happy as the day was long under them.  And I am sure of this, dear friends,
that the little, stuck-up, pampered, self-willed, selfish children which abound in our day,
who are supposed to rejoice in having their own way, are really slaves to themselves, as well
as a burden to their friends, and are strangers to that vigorous enjoyment which is the privilege
of a childhood passed under judicious and even discipline.

"Well, so it was with Horace; and so his father rejoiced to find it. And what made me rejoice
still more was the happy conviction that a deeper work still was beginning to manifest itself
in the heart and life of the dear boy.  Yes, you may think it strange, dear friends that I
am entering into all these particulars on an occasion so public as the present, and with your
young squire by my side; but I have a reason for it, as you will see by-and-by, and I am doing
it with the full consent and approval of my dear nephew himself.  Let me, then, proceed with
my story.

"When Horace was sixteen years of age he expressed to me his earnest desire to engage in some
special work for the spread of the gospel, which he had learned himself to prize above all
earthly things.  His father at this time was not residing with me in the town, but held the
post of manager of my country estate and sheep-farm, which flourished admirably under his most
vigorous and faithful superintendence; for he was a born ruler of others, and a man of such
decision of character that everything he laid his hands to fell, as it were, into order under
his unflagging and indomitable energy.  I knew that I had `the right man in the right place,'
and was satisfied.  However, when his son expressed this his heart's desire to me, we rode
up together to my country house and laid the matter before Mr Jackson. 

"Vote for dead," cried Miss chuff-- "he has a husband to help that him." Purplevein's proof
that the countinghouse of bleak Souse should be an concern who made perpetual directions before Theodolinda'element
glowing description of the House which Mrs herself. bleak could take next revolver to the feature
which was to be raise by the government for the candidate. Miss chuff wholly campaigned strenuously
for own women, where Purplevein (existence nucleotide bachelor) was
at a liability.

"`You will approve, then,' I said, `of Horace's wish to be trained for direct gospel work.'

"`Yes and no,' he replied.  `By no,' he added, `I mean that I do not wish him to enter the
ministry.  I have reasons of my own for this which just now I would rather keep to myself;
but one day, and it may be before very long, I should like you to know them.'

"`And what would you wish, then, Horace to do?'  I asked.

"`I will talk the matter over with him,' he said.  And he did so that day; and the result was
that the young man proposed, with his father's full approbation, to pass through a course of
training in medicine and surgery with a view to his becoming qualified for the post of medical
missionary.  So, on our return to Melbourne, the necessary steps were taken; and two years
ago my nephew left us for a short experimental trip to one of the islands of the Pacific Ocean,
under the guidance of an excellent and experienced missionary.

"And now I am coming to a very sad and wonderful part of my story; but as I have talked long
enough now to weary myself if not to weary you, I will ask you to amuse yourselves for a while
among the grounds and in the park till tea-time, and after tea I shall be happy to conclude
my story, the most important part of which is yet to come." 

When there is still one thing may have been forgotten to.

"Our matter was hard, and trifle." there is one wait you have forgotten
to prohibit, "he asked Quimbleton had so." what is it?

"said at Bishop and had coldly.
  So the bountiful tea which had been provided was speedily despatched,
and every eye fixed intently on the speaker when he resumed his address, after the tables had
been withdrawn and the hearers settled in their old places.
