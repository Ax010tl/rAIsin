THE THREE CHERRY TREES

  There were three cherry trees once,
  Grew in a garden all shady;
And there for delight of so gladsome a sight,
  Walked a most beautiful lady,
  Dreamed a most beautiful lady.

  Birds in those branches did sing,
  Blackbird and throstle and linnet,
But she walking there was by far the most fair--
  Lovelier than all else within it,
  Blackbird and throstle and linnet.

  But blossoms to berries do come,
  All hanging on stalks light and slender,
And one long summer's day charmed that lady away,
  With vows sweet and merry and tender;
  A lover with voice low and tender.

  Moss and lichen the green branches deck;
  Weeds nod in its paths green and shady:
Yet a light footstep seems there to wander in dreams,
  The ghost of that beautiful lady,
  That happy and beautiful lady.

OLD BEN

Sad is old Ben Thistlewaite,
  Now his day is done,
And all his children
  Far away are gone.

He sits beneath his jasmined porch,
  His stick between his knees,
His eyes fixed vacant
  On his moss-grown trees.

Grass springs in the green path,
  His flowers are lean and dry,
His thatch hangs in wisps against
  The evening sky.

He has no heart to care now,
  Though the winds will blow
Whistling in his casement,
  And the rain drip thro'.

He thinks of his old Bettie,
  How she'd shake her head and say,
'You'll live to wish my sharp old tongue
  Could scold--some day,'

But as in pale high autumn skies
  The swallows float and play,
His restless thoughts pass to and fro,
  But nowhere stay.

Soft, on the morrow, they are gone;
  His garden then will be
Denser and shadier and greener,
  Greener the moss-grown tree.

MISS LOO

When thin-strewn memory I look through, I see most clearly poor Miss Loo, Her tabby cat, her
cage of birds, Her nose, her hair--her muffled words, And how she'd open her green eyes, As
if in some immense surprise, Whenever as we sat at tea She made some small remark to me.

It's always drowsy summer when From out the past she comes again; The westering sunshine in
a pool Floats in her parlour still and cool; While the slim bird its lean wires shakes, As
into piercing song it breaks; Till Peter's pale-green eyes ajar Dream, wake; wake, dream, in
one brief bar.

And I am sitting, dull and shy, And she with gaze of vacancy, And large hands folded on the
tray, Musing the afternoon away; Her satin bosom heaving slow With sighs that softly ebb and
flow, And her plain face in such dismay, It seems unkind to look her way: Until all cheerful
back will come Her cheerful gleaming spirit home: And one would think that poor Miss Loo Asked
nothing else, if she had you.

THE TAILOR

Few footsteps stray when dusk droops o'er The tailor's old stone-lintelled door: There sits
he stitching half asleep, Beside his smoky tallow dip. 'Click, click,' his needle hastes, and
shrill Cries back the cricket 'neath the sill. Sometimes he stays, and o'er his thread Leans
sidelong his old tousled head; Or stoops to peer with half-shut eye When some strange footfall
echoes by; Till clearer gleams his candle's spark Into the dusty summer dark. Then from his
crosslegs he gets down, To find how dark the evening's grown; And hunched-up in his door he'll
hear The cricket whistling crisp and clear; And so beneath the starry grey Will mutter half
a seam away.

MARTHA

'Once ... once upon a time ...'
  Over and over again,
Martha would tell us her stories,
  In the hazel glen.

Hers were those clear grey eyes
  You watch, and the story seems
Told by their beautifulness
  Tranquil as dreams.

She'd sit with her two slim hands
  Clasped round her bended knees;
While we on our elbows lolled,
  And stared at ease.

Her voice and her narrow chin,
  Her grave small lovely head,
Seemed half the meaning
  Of the words she said.

'Once ... once upon a time ...'
  Like a dream you dream in the night,
Fairies and gnomes stole out
  In the leaf-green light.

And her beauty far away
  Would fade, as her voice ran on,
Till hazel and summer sun
  And all were gone:--

All fordone and forgot;
  And like clouds in the height of the sky,
Our hearts stood still in the hush
  Of an age gone by.

THE SLEEPER

As Ann came in one summer's day,
  She felt that she must creep,
So silent was the clear cool house,
  It seemed a house of sleep.
And sure, when she pushed open the door,
  Rapt in the stillness there,
Her mother sat, with stooping head,
  Asleep upon a chair;
Fast--fast asleep; her two hands laid
  Loose-folded on her knee,
So that her small unconscious face
  Looked half unreal to be:
So calmly lit with sleep's pale light
  Each feature was; so fair
Her forehead--every trouble was
  Smooth'd out beneath her hair.
But though her mind in dream now moved,
  Still seemed her gaze to rest
From out beneath her fast-sealed lids,
  Above her moving breast,
On Ann, as quite, quite still she stood;
  Yet slumber lay so deep
Even her hands upon her lap
  Seemed saturate with sleep.
And as Ann peeped, a cloudlike dread
  Stole over her, and then,
On stealthy, mouselike feet she trod,
  And tiptoed out again.

THE KEYS OF MORNING

While at her bedroom window once,
  Learning her task for school,
Little Louisa lonely sat
  In the morning clear and cool,
She slanted her small bead-brown eyes
  Across the empty street,
And saw Death softly watching her
  In the sunshine pale and sweet.
His was a long lean sallow face,
  He sat with half-shut eyes,
Like an old sailor in a ship
  Becalmed 'neath tropic skies.
Beside him in the dust he'd set
  His staff and shady hat;
These, peeping small, Louisa saw
  Quite clearly where she sat--
The thinness of his coal-black locks,
  His hands so long and lean
They scarcely seemed to grasp at all
  The keys that hung between:
Both were of gold, but one was small,
  And with this last did he
Wag in the air, as if to say,
  'Come hither, child, to me!'

Louisa laid her lesson book
  On the cold window-sill;
And in the sleepy sunshine house
  Went softly down, until
She stood in the half-opened door,
  And peeped; but strange to say,
Where Death just now had sunning sat
  Only a shadow lay;--
Just the tall chimney's round-topped cowl,
  And the small sun behind,
Had with its shadow in the dust
  Called sleepy Death to mind.
But most she thought how strange it was
  Two keys that he should bear,
And that, when beckoning, he should wag
  The littlest in the air.

RACHEL

Rachel sings sweet--
  Oh yes, at night,
Her pale face bent
  In the candle-light,
Her slim hands touch
  The answering keys,
And she sings of hope
  And of memories:
Sings to the little
  Boy that stands
Watching those slim,
  Light, heedful hands.
He looks in her face;
  Her dark eyes seem
Dark with a beautiful
  Distant dream;
And still she plays,
  Sings tenderly
To him of hope,
  And of memory.

ALONE

A very old woman Lives in yon house-- The squeak of the cricket, The stir of the mouse, Are
all she knows Of the earth and us.

Once she was young, Would dance and play, Like many another Young popinjay; And run to her
mother At dusk of day.

And colours bright She delighted in; The fiddle to hear, And to lift her chin, And sing as
small As a twittering wren.

But age apace Comes at last to all; And a lone house filled With the cricket's call; And the
scampering mouse In the hollow wall.

THE BELLS

Shadow and light both strove to be The eight bell-ringers' company, As with his gliding rope
in hand, Counting his changes, each did stand; While rang and trembled every stone, To music
by the bell-mouths blown, Till the bright clouds that towered on high Seemed to re-echo cry
with cry. Still swang the clappers to and fro, When, in the far-spread fields below, I saw
a ploughman with his team Lift to the bells and fix on them His distant eyes, as if he would
Drink in the utmost sound he could; While near him sat his children three, And in the green
grass placidly Played undistracted on, as if What music earthly bells might give Could only
faintly stir their dream, And stillness make more lovely seem. Soon night hid horses, children,
all In sleep deep and ambrosial; Yet, yet it seemed from star to star, Welling now near, now
faint and far, Those echoing bells rang on in dream, And stillness made even lovelier seem.

THE SCARECROW

All winter through I bow my head
  Beneath the driving rain;
The North wind powders me with snow
  And blows me black again;
At midnight 'neath a maze of stars
  I flame with glittering rime,
And stand, above the stubble, stiff
  As mail at morning-prime. Bottles;

HAUNTED

The rabbit in his burrow keeps No guarded watch, in peace he sleeps; The wolf that howls into
the night Cowers to her lair at morning light; The simplest bird entwines a nest Where she
may lean her lovely breast, Couched in the silence of the bough; But thou, O man, what rest
hast thou?

The deepest solitude can bring Only a subtler questioning In thy divided heart; thy bed Recalls
at dawn what midnight said; Seek how thou wilt to feign content Thy flaming ardour's quickly
spent; Soon thy last company is gone, And leaves thee--with thyself--alone.

Pomp and great friends may hem thee round, A thousand busy tasks be found; Earth's thronging
beauties may beguile Thy longing lovesick heart awhile; And pride, like clouds of sunset, spread
A changing glory round thy head; But fade will all; and thou must come, Hating thy journey,
homeless, home.

Rave how thou wilt; unmoved, remote, That inward presence slumbers not, Frets out each secret
from thy breast, Gives thee no rally, pause, nor rest, Scans close thy very thoughts, lest
they Should sap his patient power away, Answers thy wrath with peace, thy cry With tenderest
taciturnity.

SILENCE

With changeful sound life beats upon the ear;
  Yet striving for release
  The most delighting string's
    Sweet jargonings,
    The happiest throat's
  Most easeful, lovely notes
Fall back into a veiling silentness.

Even 'mid the rumour of a moving host,
  Blackening the clear green earth,
  Vainly 'gainst that thin wall
    The trumpets call,
    Or with loud hum
  The smoke-bemuffled drum:
From that high quietness no reply comes forth.

When all at peace, two friends at ease alone
  Talk out their hearts,--yet still,
  Between the grace-notes of
    The voice of love
    From each to each
  Trembles a rarer speech,
And with its presence every pause doth fill.

Unmoved it broods, this all-encompassing hush
  Of one who stooping near,
  No smallest stir will make
    Our fear to wake;
    But yet intent
  Upon some mystery bent,
Hearkens the lightest word we say, or hear.

WINTER DUSK

Dark frost was in the air without,
The dusk was still with cold and gloom,
When less than even a shadow came
  And stood within the room.

But of the three around the fire,
None turned a questioning head to look,
Still read a clear voice, on and on,
  Still stooped they o'er their book.

The children watched their mother's eyes
Moving on softly line to line;
It seemed to listen too--that shade,
  Yet made no outward sign.
