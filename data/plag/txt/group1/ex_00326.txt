My father was born in Sierra Leone, Africa. Of his parents and his brothers and sisters I know
nothing. I only remember that it was said that his father's name was Moncoso, and his mother's
Mongomo, which names are known only among the native Africans. He was brought from Africa when
but a boy, and sold to old Colonel Dick Singleton, who owned a great many plantations in South
Carolina, and when the old colonel divided his property among his children, father fell to
the second son, Col. M.R. Singleton.

Mother never was sold, but her parents were; they were owned by one Mr. Crough, who sold them
and the rest of the slaves, with the plantation, to Col. Dick Singleton, upon whose place mother
was born. I was born on this extensive plantation, twenty-eight miles southeast of Columbia,
South Carolina, in the year 1849. I belonged to Col. M.R. Singleton, and was held in slavery
up to the time of the emancipation proclamation issued by President Lincoln.

THE CHILDREN.

My father had fifteen children: four boys and three girls by his first wife and eight by his
second. Their names were as follows: of the boys--Toney, Aszerine, Duke and Dezine; of the
girls--Violet, Priscilla, and Lydia. Those of his second wife were as follows: Footy, Embrus,
Caleb, Mitchell, Cuffey and Jacob, and of the girls, Catherine and Retta.

SAND HILL DAYS.

Col. M.R. Singleton was like many other rich slave owners in the South, who had summer seats
four, six or eight miles from the plantation, where they carried the little negro boys and
girls too small to work.

Our summer seat, or the sand hill, as the slaves used to call it, was four miles from the plantation.
Among the four hundred and sixty-five slaves owned by the colonel there were a great many children.
If my readers had visited Col. Singleton's plantation the last of May or the first of June
in the days of slavery, they would have seen three or four large plantation wagons loaded with
little negroes of both sexes, of various complexions and conditions, who were being carried
to this summer residence, and among them they would have found the author of this little work
in his sand-hill days.

My readers would naturally ask how many seasons these children were taken to the summer seats?
I answer, until, in the judgment of the overseer, they were large enough to work; then they
were kept at the plantation. How were they fed? There were three or four women who were too
old to work on the plantation who were sent as nurses to the summer seats with the children;
they did the cooking. The way in which these old women cooked for 80, and sometimes 150 children,
in my sand-hill days, was this:--they had two or three large pots, which held about a bushel
each, in which they used to cook corn flour, stirred with large wooden paddles. The food was
dealt out with the paddles into each child's little wooden tray or tin pail, which was furnished
by the parents according to their ability.

With this corn flour, which the slaves called mush, each child used to get a gill of sour milk
brought daily from the plantation in a large wooden pail on the head of a boy or man. We children
used to like the sour milk, or hard clabber as it was called by the slaves; but that seldom
changed diet, namely the mush, was hated worse than medicine. Our hatred was increased against
the mush from the fact that they used to give us molasses to eat with it, instead of clabber.
The hateful mixture made us anxious for Sundays to come, when our mothers, fathers, sisters
and brothers would bring something from the plantation, which, however poor, we considered
very nice, compared with what we had during the week days. Among the many desirable things
our parents brought us the most delightful was cow pease, rice, and a piece of bacon, cooked
together; the mixture was called by the slaves "hopping John."

THE STORY OF GILBERT.

A few large boys were sent yearly to the sand-hill among the smaller ones, as guides. At the
time to which I am referring there was one by the name of Gilbert, who used to go around with
the smaller boys in the woods to gather bushes and sticks for the old women to cook our food with.

Gilbert was a cruel boy. He used to strip his little fellow negroes while in the woods, and
whip them two or three times a week, so that their backs were all scarred, and threatened them
with severer punishment if they told; this state of things had been going on for quite a while.
As I was a favorite with Gilbert, I always had managed to escape a whipping, with the promise
of keeping the secret of the punishment of the rest, which I did, not so much that I was afraid
of Gilbert, as because I always was inclined to mind my own business. But finally, one day,
Gilbert said to me, "Jake," as he used to call me, "you am a good boy, but I'm gwine to wip
you some to-day, as I wip dem toder boys." Of course I was required to strip off my only garment,
which was an Osnaburg linen shirt, worn by both sexes of the negro children in the summer.
As I stood trembling before my merciless superior, who had a switch in his hand, thousands
of thoughts went through my little mind as to how to get rid of the whipping. I finally fell
upon a plan which I hoped would save me from a punishment that was near at hand. There were
some carpenters in the woods, some distance from us, hewing timber; they were far away, but
it was a clear morning, so we could hear their voices and the sound of the axes. Having resolved
in my mind what I would do. I commenced reluctantly to take off my shirt, at the same time
pleading with Gilbert, who paid no attention to my prayer, but said, "Jake, I is gwine to wip
you to-day as I did dem toder boys." Having satisfied myself that no mercy was to be found
with Gilbert, I drew my shirt off and threw it over his head, and bounded forward on a run
in the direction of the sound of the carpenters. By the time he got from the entanglement of
my garment, I had quite a little start of him. Between my starting point and the place where
the carpenters were at work I jumped over some bushes five or six feet high. Gilbert soon gained
upon me, and sometimes touched me with his hands, but as I had on nothing for him to hold to,
he could not take hold of me. As I began to come in sight of the carpenters, Gilbert begged
me not to go to them, for he knew that it would be bad for him, but as that was not a time
for me to listen to his entreaties, I moved on faster. As I got near to the carpenters, one
of them ran and met me, into whose arms I jumped. The man into whose arms I ran was Uncle Benjamin,
my mother's uncle. As he clasped me in his arms, he said, "Bres de Lo, my son, wat is de matter?" For

 The boys were required to bend the body forward
with head down, and rest the body on the left foot, and scrape the right foot backward on the
ground, while uttering the words, "how dy Massie and Missie." The girls were required to use
the same words, accompanied with a courtesy. But when Master and Mistress had left, the little
African wools were neglected until the news of their next visit.

Our sand-hill days were very pleasant, outside of the seldom changed diet, namely the mush,
which we had sometimes to eat with molasses, the treatment of Gilbert, and the attempt to straighten
out our unruly wools.

I said that my father was brought from Africa when but a boy, and was sold to old Col. Dick
Singleton; and when the children were of age, the Colonel divided his plantations among them,
and father fell to Col. M.K. Singleton, who was the second son.

On this large plantation there were 465 slaves; there were not so many when it was given to
Col. M.R., but increased to the above stated number, up to the time of emancipation.

My father was not a field hand; my first recollection of him was that he used to take care
of hogs and cows in the swamp, and when too old for that work he was sent to the plantation
to take care of horses and mules, as master had a great many for the use of his farm.

I have stated that father said that his father's name in Africa was Moncoso, and his mother's
Mongomo, but I never learned what name he went by before he was brought to this country. I
only know that he stated that Col. Dick Singleton gave him the name of William, by which he
was known up to the day of his death. Father had a surname, Stroyer, which he could not use
in public, as the surname Stroyer would be against the law; he was known only by the name of
William Singleton, because that was his master's name. So the title Stroyer was forbidden him,
and could be used only by his children after the emancipation of the slaves.

There were two reasons given by the slave holders why they did not allow a slave to use his
own name, but rather that of the master. The first was that, if he ran away, he would not be
so easily detected by using his own name as by that of his master. The second was that to allow
him to use his own name would be sharing an honor which was due only to his master, and that
would be too much for a negro, said they, who was nothing more than a servant. So it was held
as a crime for a slave to be caught using his own name, a crime which would expose him to severe
punishment. But thanks be to God that those days have passed, and we now live under the sun
of liberty.

MOTHER.

Mother's name was Chloe. She belonged to Col. M.R. Singleton too; she was a field hand, and
never was sold, but her parents were once.

Mr. Crough who, as I have said had owned this plantation on which mother lived, had sold the
plantation to Col. Dick Singleton, with mother's parents on it, before she was born.

Most of the family from which mother came, had trades of some kind; some were carpenters, some
were blacksmiths, some house servants, and others were made drivers over the other negroes.
Of course the negro drivers would be under a white man, who was called the overseer. Sometimes
the negro drivers were a great deal worse to their fellow negroes than were the white men.

Mother had an uncle by the name of Esau, whom master thought more of than he did of the overseer.
Uncle Esau was more cruel than was any white man master ever had on his plantation. Many of
the slaves used to run away from him into the woods. I have known some of the negroes to run
away from the cruel treatment of Uncle Esau, and to stay off eight or ten months. They were
so afraid of him that they used to say that they would rather see the devil than to see him;
they were glad when he died. But while so much was said of Uncle Esau, which was also true
of many other negro drivers, the overseers themselves were not guiltless of cruelty to the
defenceless slaves.

I have said that most of the family from which mother came had trades of some kind; but she
had to take her chance in the field with those who had to weather the storm. But my readers
are not to think that those whom I have spoken of as having trades were free from punishment,
for they were not; some of them had more trouble than had the field hands. At times the overseer,
who was a white man, would go to the shop of the blacksmith, or carpenter, and would pick a
quarrel with him, so as to get an opportunity to punish him. He would say to the negro, "Oh,
ye think yourself as good as ye master, ye--" Of course he knew what the overseer was after,
so he was afraid to speak; the overseer, hearing no answer, would turn to him and cry out,
"ye so big ye can't speak to me, ye--," and then the conflict would begin, and he would give
that man such a punishment as would disable him for two or three months. If the lawcourt after tone

When I had got away from him I ran to father with all my might, but soon found my expectation
blasted, as father very coolly said to me, "Go back to your work and be a good boy, for I cannot
do anything for you." But that did not satisfy me, so on I went to mother with my complaint
and she came out to the man who had whipped me; he was a groom, a white man master had hired
to train the horses. Mother and he began to talk, then he took a whip and started for her,
and she ran from him, talking all the time. I ran back and forth between mother and him until
he stopped beating her. After the fight between the groom and mother, he took me back to the
stable yard and gave me a severe flogging. And, although mother failed to help me at first,
still I had faith that when he had taken me back to the stable yard, and commenced whipping
me, she would come and stop him, but I looked in vain, for she did not come.

Then the idea first came to me that I, with my dear father and mother and the rest of my fellow
negroes, was doomed to cruel treatment through life, and was defenceless. But when I found
that father and mother could not save me from punishment, as they themselves had to submit
to the same treatment, I concluded to appeal to the sympathy of the groom, who seemed to have
full control over me; but my pitiful cries never touched his sympathy, for things seemed to
grow worse rather than better; so I made up my mind to stem the storm the best I could.

I have said that Col. Singleton had fine horses, which he kept for racing, and he owned two
very noted ones, named Capt. Miner and Inspector. Perhaps some of my readers have already heard
of Capt. Miner, for he was widely known, having won many races in Charlestown and Columbia,
S.C., also in Augusta, Ga., and New York. He was a dark bay, with short tail. Inspector was
a chestnut sorrel, and had the reputation of being a very great horse. These two horses have
won many thousand dollars for the the colonel. I rode these two horses a great many times in
their practice gallops, but never had the opportunity to ride them in a race before Col. Singleton
died, for he did not live long after I had learned so that I could ride for money. The custom
was, that when a boy had learned the trade of a rider, he would have to ride what was known
as a trial, in the presence of a judge, who would approve or disapprove his qualifications
to be admitted as a race rider, according to the jockey laws of South Carolina at that time.

I have said that I loved the business and acquired the skill very early, and this enabled me
to pass my examination creditably, and to be accepted as a capable rider, but I passed through
some very severe treatment before reaching that point.

This white man who trained horses for Col. Singleton was named Boney Young; he had a brother
named Charles, who trained for the colonel's brother, John Singleton. Charles was a good man,
but Boney our trainer, was as mean as Charles was good; he could smile in the face of one who
was suffering the most painful death at his hands.

One day, about two weeks after Boney Young and mother had the conflict, he called me to him,
as though he were in the pleasantest mood; he was singing. I ran to him as if to say by action,
I will do anything you bid me, willingly. When I got to him he said, "Go and bring me a switch,
sir." I answered, "yes, sir," and off I went and brought him one; then he said, "come in here,
sir;" I answered, "yes, sir;" and I went into a horse's stall, but while I was going in a thousand
thoughts passed through my mind as to what he wanted me to go into the stall for, but when
I had got in I soon learned, for he gave me a first-class flogging.

A day or to after that he called me in the same way, and I went again, and he sent me for a
switch. I brought him a short stubble that was worn out, which he took and beat me on the head
with. Then he said to me, "Go and bring me a switch, sir;" Then he said to me, "Come in here,
sir." I answered, "Yes, sir." When I went into the stall, he told me to lie down, and I stooped
down; he kicked me around for a while, then, making me lie on my face, he whipped me to his
satisfaction.

That evening when I went home to father and mother, I said to them, "Mr. Young is whipping
me too much now, I shall not stand it, I shall fight him." Father said to me, "You must not
do that, because if you do he will say that your mother and I advised you to do it, and it
will make it hard for your mother and me, as well as for yourself. You must do as I told you,
my son: do your work the best you can, and do not say anything." I said to father, "But I don't
know what I have done that he should whip me; he does not tell me what wrong I have done, he
simply calls me to him and whips me when he gets ready." Father said, "I can do nothing more
than to pray to the Lord to hasten the time when these things shall be done away; that is all
I can do." When mother had stripped me and looked at the wounds that were upon me she burst
into tears, and said, "If he were not so small I would not mind it so much; this will break
his constitution; I am going to master about it, because I know he will not allow Mr. Young
to treat this child so."

And I thought to myself that had mother gone to master about it, it would have helped me some,
for he and she had grown up together and he thought a great deal of her. But father said to
mother, "You better not go to master, for while he might stop the child from being treated
badly, Mr. Young may revenge himself through the overseer, for you know that they are very
friendly to each other." So said father to mother, "You would gain nothing in the end; the
best thing for us to do is to pray much over it, for I believe that the time will come when
this boy with the rest of the children will be free, though we may not live to see it."

When father spoke of liberty his words were of great comfort to me, and my heart swelled with
the hope of a future, which made every moment seem an hour to me.

Father had a rule, which was strictly carried out as far as possible under the slave law, which
was to put his children to bed early; but that night the whole family sat up late, while father
and mother talked over the matter. It was a custom among the slaves not to allow their children
under certain ages to enter into conversation with them; hence we could take no part with father
and mother. As I was the object of their sympathy, I was allowed the privilege of answering
the questions about the whipping the groom gave me.

When the time came for us to go to bed we all knelt down in family prayer, as was our custom;
father's prayer seemed more real to me that night than ever before, especially in the words,
"Lord, hasten the time when these children shall be their own free men and women."

 This cruel treatment
soon hardened me so that I did not care for him at all.

A short time afterwards I was sent with the other boys about four or five miles from home,
up the public road, to practice the horse, and they gave me a very wild animal to ride, which
threw me very often. Mr. Young did not go with us, but sent a colored groom every morning,
who was very faithful to every task alloted him; he was instructed to whip me every time the
horse threw me while away from home. I got many little floggings by the colored groom, as the
horse threw me, a great many times, but the floggings I got from him were very feeble compared
with those of the white man; hence I was better content to go away with the colored groom than
to be at home where I should have worse punishment.

But the time was coming when they ceased to whip me for being thrown by horses. One day, as
I was riding along the road, the horse that I was upon darted at the sight of a bird, which
flew across the way, throwing me upon a pile of brush. The horse stepped on my cheek, and the
head of a nail in his shoe went through my left cheek and broke a tooth, but it was done so
quickly that I hardly felt it. It happened that he did not step on me with his whole weight,
if he had my jaw would have been broken. When I got up the colored groom was standing by me,
but he could not whip me when he saw the blood flowing from my mouth, so he took me down to
the creek, which was but a short distance from the place, and washed me, and then taking me
home, sent for a doctor, who dressed the wound.

When Mr. Young saw my condition, he asked how it was done, and upon being told he said it ought
to have killed me. After the doctor had dressed my face, of course I went home, thinking they
would allow me to stay until I got well, but I had no sooner arrived than the groom sent for
me; I did not answer, as my jaw pained me very much. When he found that I did not come, he
came after me himself, and said if I did not come to the stable right away, he would whip me,
so I went with him. He did not whip me while I was in that condition, but he would not let
me lie down, so I suffered very much from exposure.

When mother came that night from the farm and saw my condition, she was overcome with grief;
she said to father, "this wound is enough to kill the child, and that merciless man will not
let him lie down until he gets well: this is too hard." Father said to her, "I know it is very
hard, but what can we do? for if we try to keep this boy in the house it will cause us trouble."
Mother said, "I wish they would take him out of the world, then he would be out of pain, and
we should not have to fret about him, for he would be in heaven." Then she took hold of me
and said, "Does it hurt you, son?" meaning my face, and I said, "Yes, mamma," and she shed
tears; but she had no little toys to give me to comfort me; she could only promise me such
as she had, which were eggs and chickens.

Father did not show his grief for me as mother did, but he tried to comfort mother all he could,
and at times would say to me, "Never mind, my son, you will be a man bye and bye," but he did
not know what was passing through my mind at that time. Though I was very small I thought that
if, while a boy, my treatment was so severe, it would be much worse when I became a man, and
having had a chance to see how men were being punished, it was a very poor consolation to me.

Finally the time came for us to go to bed, and we all knelt in family prayer. Father thanked
God for having saved me from a worse injury, and then he prayed for mother's comfort, and also
for the time which he predicted would come, that is, the time of freedom, when I and the rest
of the children would be our own masters and mistresses; then he commended us to God, and we
all went to bed. The next morning I went to my work with a great deal of pain. They did not
send me up the road with the horses in that condition, but I had to ride the old horses to
water, and work around the stable until I was well enough to go with the other boys. But I
am happy to say that from the time I got hurt by that horse I was never thrown except through
carelessness, neither was I afraid of a horse after that.

Notwithstanding father and mother fretted very much about me, they were proud of my success
as a rider, but my hardships did not end here.

A short time after, I was taken to Columbia and Charleston, S.C., where they used to have the
races. That year Col. Singleton won a large sum of money by the well-known horse, Capt. Miner,
and that was the same season that I rode my trial race. The next year, before the time of racing,
Col. Singleton died at his summer seat. In the water meant everything; we had had experiences from thirst, had
not in be uneasy man by a lifetime.

Else of the river men grew precarious. The drink, and bathing; everywhere away water was young,
or had the dreadful. It was against the law for a slave to buy spirituous liquors
without a ticket, but Charles used to give the boys tickets to buy rum and whiskey with. He
also allowed them to steal the neighbor's cows and hogs.
