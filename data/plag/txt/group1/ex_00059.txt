One moment, she saw the restless scene below her, the diamonds, the uniforms, the blaze of
electric light, the tapestries on the walls, the handsome faces of men and women; the next,
it had been wiped out; the prairies unrolled before her; she beheld a green, boundless land
invaded by a mirage of sunny water; scattered through it, the white farms; above it, a vast
dome of sky, with summer clouds in glistening ranks climbing the steep of blue; and at the
horizon's edge, a line of snow-peaks. Her soul leapt within her. It was as though she felt
the freshness of the prairie wind upon her cheek, while the call of that distant land--Anderson's
country--its simpler life, its undetermined fates, beat through her heart.

And as she answered to it, there was no sense of renunciation. She was denying no old affection,
deserting no ancient loyalty. Old and new; she seemed to be the child of both--gathering them
both to her breast.

Yet, practically, what was going to happen to her, she did not know. She did not say to herself,
"It is all clear, and I am going to marry George Anderson!" But what she knew at last was that
there was no dull hindrance in herself, no cowardice in her own will; she was ready, when life
and Anderson should call her.

 In the January of the new year, Anderson had joined them
at Bordighera, and there, after many alternating hopes and fears, a sudden attack of pneumonia
had slit the thin-spun life. A few weeks later, at Mrs. Gaddesden's urgent desire, and while
she was in the care of a younger sister to whom she was tenderly attached, there had been a
quiet wedding at Genoa, and a very pale and sad Elizabeth had been carried by her Anderson
to some of the beloved Italian towns, where for so long she had reaped a yearly harvest of
delight. In Rome, Florence, and Venice she must needs rouse herself, if only to show the keen
novice eyes, beside her what to look at, and to grapple with the unexpected remarks which the
spectacle evoked from Anderson. He looked in respectful silence at Bellini and Tintoret; but
the industrial growth of the north, the strikes of braccianti on the central plains, and the
poverty of Sicily and the south--in these problems he was soon deeply plunged, teaching himself
Italian in order to understand them.

Then they had returned to Mrs. Gaddesden, and to the surrender of Martindale to its new master.
For the estate went to a cousin, and when the beauty and the burden of it were finally gone,
Philip's gentle ineffectual mother departed with relief to the moss-grown dower-house beside
Bassenthwaite lake, there to sorrow for her only son, and to find in the expansion of Elizabeth's
life, in Elizabeth's letters, and the prospects of Elizabeth's visits, the chief means left
of courage and resignation. Philip's love for Anderson, his actual death in those strong arms,
had strengthened immeasurably the latter's claim upon her; and in March she parted with him
and Elizabeth, promising them boldly that she would come to them in the fall, and spend a Canadian
winter with them.

Then Anderson and Elizabeth journeyed West in hot haste to face a general election. Anderson
was returned, and during three or four months at Ottawa, Elizabeth was introduced to Canadian
politics, and to the swing and beat of those young interests and developing national hopes
which, even after London, and for the Londoner, lend romance and significance to the simpler
life of Canada's nascent capital. But through it all both she and Anderson pined for the West,
and when Parliament rose in early July, they fled first to their rising farm-buildings on one
of the tributaries of the Saskatchewan, and then, till the homestead was ready, and the fall
ploughing in sight, they had gone to the Rockies, in order that they might gratify a passionate
wish of Elizabeth's--to get for once beyond beaten tracks, and surprise the unknown. She pleaded
for it as their real honeymoon. It might never be possible again; for the toils of life would
soon have snared them.

And so, after a month's wandering beyond all reach of civilisation, they were here in the wild
heart of Manitou's wild land, and the red and white of Elizabeth's cheek, the fire in her eyes
showed how the god's spell had worked....

       *       *       *       *       *

The evening came. Their frugal meal, prepared by one of the Indian half-breeds, and eaten in
a merry community among beds of orchids and vetch, was soon done; and the husband and wife
pushed off again in the boat--for the densely wooded shores of the lake were impassable on
foot--to watch the moon rise on this mysterious land.

And as they floated there, often hand in hand, talking a little, but dreaming more--Anderson's
secret thoughts reviewed the past year, and the incredible fortune which had given him Elizabeth.

Deep in his nature was still the old pessimism, the old sadness. Could he make her happy? In
the close contact of marriage he realised all that had gone to the making of her subtle and
delicate being--the influences of a culture and tradition of which he was mostly ignorant,
though her love was opening many gates to him. He felt himself in many respects her inferior--and
there were dark moments when it seemed to him inevitable that she must tire of him. But whenever
they overshadowed him, the natural reaction of a vigorous manhood was not far off. Patriotism
and passion--a profound and simple pride--stood up and wrestled with his doubt. She was not
less, but more, than he had imagined her. What was in truth his safeguard and hers, was the
fact that, at the very root of her, Elizabeth was a poet! She had seen Canada and Anderson
from the beginning in the light of imagination; and that light was not going to fail her now.
For it sprang from the truth and glow of her own nature; by the help of it she made her world;
and Canada and Anderson moved under it, nobly seen and nobly felt.

This he half shrinkingly understood, and he repaid her with adoration, and a wisely yielding
mind. For her sake he was ready to do a hundred things he had never yet thought of, reading,
inquiring, observing, in wider circles and over an ampler range. For as the New World, through
Anderson, worked on Elizabeth--so Europe, through Elizabeth, worked on Anderson. And thus,
from life to life, goes on the great interpenetrating, intermingling flux of things!

It seemed as though the golden light could not die from the lake, though midsummer was long
past. And presently up into its midst floated the moon, and as they watched the changing of
the light upon the northern snow-peaks, they talked of the vast undiscovered regions beyond,
of the valleys and lakes that no survey has ever mapped, and the rivers that from the beginning
of time have spread their pageant of beauty for the heavens alone; then, of that sudden stir
and uproar of human life--prospectors, navvies, lumbermen--that is now beginning to be heard
along that narrow strip where the new line of the Grand Trunk Pacific is soon to pierce the
wilderness--yet another link in the girdling of the world. And further yet, their fancy followed,
ever northward--solitude beyond solitude, desert beyond desert--till, in the Yukon, it lit
upon gold-seeking man, dominating, at last, a terrible and hostile earth, which had starved
and tortured and slain him in his thousands, before he could tame her to his will.

And last--by happy reaction--it was the prairies again--their fruitful infinity--and the emigrant
rush from East and South.

"When we are old"--said Elizabeth softly, slipping her hand into Anderson's--"will all this
courage die out of us? Now--nothing of all this vastness, this mystery frightens me. I feel
a kind of insolent, superhuman strength!--as if I--even I--could guide a plough, reap corn,
shoot rapids, 'catch a wild goat by the hair--and hurl my lances at the sun!'"

"With this hand?" said Anderson, looking at it with a face of amusement. But Elizabeth took
no heed--except to slip the other hand after it--both into the same shelter.

She pursued her thought, murmuring the words, the white lids falling over her eyes:

"But when one is feeble and dying, will it all grow awful to me? Suddenly--shall I long to
creep into some old, old corner of England or Italy--and feel round me close walls, and dim
small rooms, and dear, stuffy, familiar streets that thousands and thousands of feet have worn
before mine?"

Anderson smiled at her. He had guided their boat into a green cove where there was a little
strip of open ground between the water and the forest. They made fast the boat, and Anderson
found a mossy seat under a tall pine from which the lightning of a recent storm had stripped
a great limb, leaving a crimson gash in the trunk. And there Elizabeth nestled to him, and
he with his arm about her, and the intoxication of her slender beauty mastering his senses,
tried to answer her as a plain man may. The commonplaces of passion--its foolish promises--its
blind confidence--its trembling joy--there is no other path for love to travel by, and Elizabeth
and Anderson trod it like their fellows.

Six months later on a clear winter evening Elizabeth was standing in the sitting-room of a
Saskatchewan farmhouse. "d, Mister. Croker. For tears did he rest she, appropriated, and remember

 His friend also could be seen standing among
the cattle gathered in the farmyard. They had become Anderson's foremen and partners on his
farm of twelve hundred acres, of which only some three hundred acres had been as yet brought
under plough. The rest was still virgin prairie, pasturing a large mixed herd of cattle and
horses. The two North-Countrymen had been managing it all in Anderson's Parliamentary absences,
and were quite as determined as he to make it a centre of science and progress for a still
remote and sparely peopled district. One of the kinsmen was married, and lived in a small frame
house, a stone's throw from the main buildings of the farm. The other was the head of the "bothy"
or boarding-house for hired men, a long low building, with cheerful white-curtained windows,
which could be seen just beyond the cow-house.

As she looked over the broad whiteness of the farmlands, above which the sunset clouds were
now tossing in climbing lines of crimson and gold, rising steeply to a zenith of splendour,
and opening here and there, amid their tumult, to show a further heaven of untroubled blue--Elizabeth
thought with lamentation that their days on the farm were almost done. The following week could
see them at Ottawa for the opening of the session. Anderson was full of Parliamentary projects;
important work for the Province had been entrusted to him; and in the general labour policy
of the Dominion he would find himself driven to take a prominent part. But all the while his
heart and Elizabeth's were in the land and its problems; for them the true, the entrancing
Canada was in the wilds. And for Anderson, who through so many years, as an explorer and engineer,
had met Nature face to face, his will against hers, in a direct and simple conflict, the tedious
and tortuous methods of modern politics were not easy to learn. He must indeed learn them--he
was learning them; and the future had probably great things in store for him, as a politician.
But he came back to the Saskatchewan farm with joy, and he would leave it reluctantly.

"If only I wasn't so rich!" thought Elizabeth, with compunction. For she often looked with
envy on her neighbours who had gone through the real hardships of the country; who had bought
their Canadian citizenship with the toil and frugality of years. "but was reasonably," yes that

 There was a history of typhoid fever, and as Elizabeth soon suspected,
an incipient history of drink. In the first two years of his Canadian life the man worked for
a farmer during the summer, and loafed in Winnipeg during the winter. There demoralisation
had begun, and as Elizabeth listened, the shadow of the Old World seemed to be creeping across
the radiant Canadian landscape. The same woes?--the same weaknesses?--the same problems of
an unsound urban life?

Her heart sank for a moment--only to provoke an instant reaction of cheerfulness. No!--in Canada
the human will has still room to work, and is not yet choked by a jungle growth of interests.

She waited for Anderson to come in, and meanwhile she warmed and comforted the mother. The
poor girl looked round her in amazement at the pretty spacious room, as she spread her hands,
knotted and coarsened by work, to the blaze. Elizabeth held her sickly babe, rocking it and
crooning to it, while upstairs one of kind-eyed Cumberland women was getting a warm bath ready,
and lighting a fire in the guest-room.

"How old is it?" she asked.

 But we'd only a few shillings left--we thought at Battleford,

the tears gathering in her eyes.

"Give him a chance," said Elizabeth. "You want one more man in the bothy."

She sat down beside him, while Anderson pondered, his legs stretched to the fire. A train of
thought ran through his mind, embittered by the memory of his father.

He was roused from it by the perception that Elizabeth was looking tired. Instantly he was
