One case, at least, among Jesus' raisings of the "dead," that of the young daughter of the
ruler of the synagogue,[19] is admitted even by sceptical critics to have been a resuscitation
from the trance that merely simulates death. But the fact that there is a record of his saying
in this case, "the child is not dead, but sleepeth," and no record of his saying the same at
the bier of the widow's son,[20] is slight ground, yet all the ground there is, against the
great probabilities to the contrary, for regarding the latter case as so transcendently different
from the former as the actual reëmbodiment of a departed spirit recalled from another world.
Were these the only two cases of restoration to life in the ministry of Jesus, it is most probable
that they would be regarded as of the same kind.

The raising of Lazarus[21] presents peculiar features, in view of which it is generally regarded
as of another kind, and the greatest of miracles, so stupendous that the Rev. W. J. Dawson,
in his recent Life of Christ, written from an evangelical standpoint, says of it: "Even the
most devout mind may be forgiven occasional pangs of incredulity." But the considerations already
presented are certainly sufficient to justify a reëxamination of the case. And it is to be
borne in mind that the question at issue is, not what the eye-witnesses at that time believed,
not what the Church from that time to this has believed, not what we are willing to believe,
or would like to believe, but what all the facts with any bearing on the case, taken together,
fully justify us in believing as to the real nature of it.

What Jesus is recorded as saying of it is, of course, of prime importance. Were this all, the
case might easily have been classed as one of trance. The disciples, however, understood Jesus
to speak of natural sleep. "Then Jesus therefore said unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead."
Tradition puts the maximum meaning into this word "dead." But if this word here qualifies the
preceding word, "fallen asleep," so also is it qualified by that; the two are mutually explanatory,
not contradictory. These alternatives are before us: Is the maximum or the minimum meaning
to be assigned to the crucial word "dead"? For the minimum, one can say that a deathly trance,
already made virtual death by immediate interment, would amply justify Jesus in using the word
"dead" in order to impress the disciples with the gravity of the case, as not a natural but
a deathly, and, in the existing situation, a fatal sleep. For the maximum, no more can be advanced
than the hazardous assertion that Jesus must have used the word with technical precision in
its customary sense; an assertion of course protected from disproof by our ignorance of the
actual fact.[22] But whatever support this view of the case derives from such ignorance is
overbalanced by the support supplied to the other view by the long history of revivals from
the deathly trance, and by the probabilities which that history creates.

Many, to whom the view here proposed seems not only new, but unwelcome, and even revolutionary,
may reasonably prefer to suspend judgment for reflection; but meanwhile some further considerations
may be entertained.

1. Aside from the unwillingness to abandon a long-cherished belief on any subject whatever,
which is both a natural, and, when not pushed to an unreasonable length, a desirable brake
on all inconsiderate change, no practical interest is threatened by the adoption of the view
here suggested. Religious interest, so far as it is also intelligent, is certainly not threatened.
The evidences of Jesus' divine character and mission resting, as for modern men it rests, not
on remote wonders, but on now acknowledged facts of an ethical and spiritual kind, is altogether
independent of our conclusion whether it was from actual or only apparent death that Lazarus
was raised. Since all the mighty works wrought by Jesus, and this among them, were identical
in type with those wrought by the ancient prophets, with whom his countrymen classed him in
his lifetime, their evidential significance could be, even for the eye-witnesses at that tomb,
no greater for him than for an Elisha,--signs of a divine mission attesting itself by works
of mercy.

2. As works of mercy these raisings from the "dead," including that of Lazarus, rank far higher
in the view of them here proposed than in the traditional view. This regards them as the recall
of departed spirits from what is hoped to be "a better world." Yet this, while it turns sorrow
for a time into joy, involves not only the recurrence of that sorrow in all its keenness, but
also a second tasting of the pains preliminary to the death-gate, when the time comes to pass
that gate again. But in the other view, a raising from the death that is only simulated is
a merciful deliverance from a calamity greater than simple death, if that be any calamity at
all,--the fate of burial alive. In the former view, therefore, the quality of mercy, distinctive
of the mighty works of Jesus, is imperfectly demonstrable. In the present view, as the rescue
of the living from death in one of its most horrible forms, it is abundantly conspicuous. 

Shaving was not recorded himself among all the Romans till late. Pliny tells us that P. Ticinias was
the first who stood the supposed barber be reënergizing Rome, which was in a year been from no

and Adrianus was the emperor (conveys Dion,) was the first of all

 To speak, as many do, of the "resurrection of Lazarus" is a misuse of words. Resuscitation
to life in this world, and resurrection, the rising up of the released spirit into the life
of the world to come, are as distinct as are the worlds to which they severally belong. We
here consider only the raisings which restored to the virtually dead their interrupted mortal
life. The rising from the mortal into the immortal state belongs to an entirely different field
of study.

Apart, then, from traditional prepossessions, examination of the Biblical narratives discloses
nothing to invalidate the hypothesis which one who is acquainted with the copious record of
apparent but unreal death must seriously and impartially consider. The reputedly miraculous
raisings of the "dead" related in both the Old and the New Testament may, with entire reason,
and without detriment to religion, be classed with such as are related outside of the Scriptures,
in ancient times as well as modern, and as phenomena wholly within the natural order, however
extraordinary. The practical result of such a conclusion is likely to be a gain for the historicity
of the Scripture narratives in the estimate of a large class of thoughtful minds.

FOOTNOTES:

[12] An objection to the historicity of the raising of Lazarus which is made on the ground
that so great a work, if historical, would have been related by more than one of the Evangelists,
yields on reflection the possibility that Jesus may have effected more than the three raisings
recorded of him. John is the sole narrator of the raising of Lazarus. But he omits notice of
the two raisings recorded by the other Evangelists, while Matthew and Mark do not record the
raising of the widow's son recorded by Luke. All this suggests that the record may have preserved
for us specimens rather than a complete list of this class of miracles. (Compare John xxi. 25.)

[13] "We have frequent cases of trance, ... where the parties seem to die, but after a time
the spirit returns, and life goes on as before. In all this there is no miracle. Why may not
the resuscitations in Christ's time possibly have been similar cases? Is not this less improbable
than that the natural order of the universe should have been set aside?"--The Problem of Final
Destiny, by William B. Brown, D.D., 1899.

[22] Was Jesus aware that Lazarus was really not dead? It is impossible to reach a positive
conclusion. In some directions his knowledge was certainly limited. That he was not aware of
the reality might be inferred from his seeming to have allowed his act to pass for what, in
the view of it here suggested, it was not,--the recall to life of one actually dead. None of these bills
of diet (says Pennant) have reached me; but doubtless they were very magnificent. After building
had the essentials of good kitchens, and other offices, in the non year, he give here the mayor's, which
before had usually been done in Grocers'Hall. While
far from positiveness, awareness may exist in a degree that gives courage for resolute effort
resulting in clear and full verification. Jesus may have been ignorant of the objective reality
of Lazarus's condition, and yet have been very hopeful of being empowered by the divine aid
he prayed for (John xi. 41) to cope with it successfully.

[23] See pages 28, 29, Note.

[24] Jesus' works of healing are explicitly attributed by the Evangelists to a peculiar power
that issued from him. In Mark v. 30, Luke vi. 19, and viii. 46, the original word dunamis,
which the Authorized Version translates "virtue," is more correctly rendered "power" in the
Revised Version. Especially noticeable is the peculiar phraseology of Mark v. 30: "Jesus perceiving
in himself that the power proceeding from him had gone forth (R. V.)." The peculiar circumstances
of the case suggest that the going forth of this power might be motived sub-consciously, as
well as by conscious volition.

At this point it seems possible to approach a clearer understanding of the proper meaning to
attach to the generally ill-defined and hazy term miracle.[27] Matthew Arnold's fantastic illustration
of the idea of miracle by supposing a pen changed to a pen-wiper may fit some miracles, especially
those of the Catholic hagiology, but, if applied to those of Jesus, would be a caricature. Perhaps
one of some canons, having made him reiterate of the self-accusation, says the supplication usual at
the day of giving condition; after which work, the prisoner kneeling hither, lifts up no shrine
three day, amid the acclaim of the people assembled to the ceremony. When they have arrived to

Be it noted, now, that the marvellous phenomena of the Biblical record, whatever else be thought
of them, are, even to a superficial view, the extraordinary effluence of extraordinary lives.
Here at length we gain a clearer conception of miracle. Life is the world's great magician,--life,
so familiar, yet so mysterious; so commonplace, yet so transcendent. No miracle is more marvellous
than its doings witnessed in the biological laboratory, or more inexplicable than its transformation
of dead matter into living flesh, its development of a Shakespeare from a microscopic bit of
protoplasm. But its mysterious processes are too common for general marvel; we marvel only
at the uncommon. The boy Zerah Colburn in half a minute solved the problem, "How many seconds
since the beginning of the Christian era?" We prefer to call this a prodigy rather than a miracle,--a
distinction more verbal than real; and we fancy we have explained it when we say that such
arithmetical power was a peculiar endowment of his mental life. Now all of the inexplicable,
inimitable reality that at any time has to be left by the baffled intellect as an unsolved
wonder under the name of miracle is just that,--the natural product of an extraordinary endowment
of life. More of its marvellous capability is latent in common men, in the subconscious depths
of being, than has ever yet flashed forth in the career of uncommon men. Some scientists say
that it depends on chemical and physical forces. It indeed uses these to build the various
bodies it inhabits, but again it leaves these to destroy those bodies when it quits them. The
most constant and ubiquitous phenomenon in the world, the ultimate reality in the universe,
is life, revealing its presence in innumerable modes of activity, from the dance of atoms in
the rock to the philosophizing of the sage and the aspirations of the saint,--the creator of
Nature, the administrator of the regular processes we call the laws of Nature, the author of
the wonders men call miraculous because they are uncommon and ill understood.

The works of which any man is naturally capable are conditioned by the psychical quality of
his life, and its power to use the forces of Nature. Through differences of vital endowment
some can use color, as wonderful painters, and others employ sound, as wonderful musicians,
in ways impossible to those otherwise endowed. So "a poet is born, not made." So persons of
feeble frame, stimulated by disease or frenzied by passion, have put forth preternatural and
prodigious muscular strength. By what we call "clairvoyant" power life calls up in intelligent
perception things going on far beyond ocular vision. By what we call "telepathic" power life
communicates intelligence with life separated by miles of space. Such are some of the powers
that have been discovered, and fully attested, but not explained, as belonging to the world's
master magician, Life. And when the poet asks,--

                "Ah, what will our children be,
    The men of a hundred thousand, a million summers away?"

we can only answer with the Apostle: "It doth not yet appear what we shall be." But we cannot
deem it likely that the powers of life,

    "Deep seated in our mystic frame,"

and giving forth such flashes of their inherent virtue, have already reached their ultimate
development.

We look with wonder and awe into the secret shrine of life, where two scarcely visible cells
unite to form the human being whose thought shall arrange the starry heavens in majestic order,
and harness the titanic energies of Nature for the world's work. There we behold the real supernatural.
Nothing is more natural than life, and nothing also more supernatural. Biology studies all
the various forms that the world shows of it, and affirms that life, though multiform, is one.
This embryology attests, showing that the whole ascent of life through diverse forms from the
lowest to the highest, during the millions of years since life first manifested its presence
on this globe, is recapitulated in the stages of growth through which the human being passes
in the few months before its birth. And philosophy, which does not seek the living among the
dead, affirms, omne vivum ex vivo. The varied but unitary life of the world is the stream of
an exhaustless spring. It is filial to the life of God, the Father Almighty. What the ancient
creed affirmed of the Christ as the Son of God--whom his beloved disciple recognized as "the
eternal life which was with the Father and was manifested unto us[34]"--may be truly affirmed
of the mysterious reality that is known as life: "Begotten not made; being of one substance
with the Father; through whom [or which] all things were made." Looking from the derived and
finite life of the world, visible only in the signs of its presence, but in its reality no
more visible than him "whom no man hath seen, nor can see," up to the life underived, aboriginal,
infinite, we recognize God and Life as terms of identical significance. How superficial the
notion of miracles as "the personal intervention of God into the chain of cause and effect,"
in which he is the constant vital element. If an event deemed miraculous is ever ascribed,
as of old, to "the finger of God," the reality behind the phenomenon is simply a higher or
a stronger power of life than is recognized in an event of a common type--life that is one
with the infinite and universal Life,

              "Life that in me has rest,
    As I, undying Life, have power in Thee."

FOOTNOTES:

[34] 1 John i. 2.

The present line of thought has now reached the point where an important question confronts
us,--a question not wholly new. Within the memory of living men theologians have been compelled
to ask themselves: What if the geologists should establish facts that contradict our Biblically
derived doctrine that the universe was made in a week? Again have they been constrained to
put to themselves the question: What if the evolutionists should supersede our doctrine that
the creation is the immediate product of successive fiats of the Creator by showing that it
came gradually into existence through the progressive operation of forces immanent in the cosmos?
Still again have they had to face the question: What if modern criticism by the discovery of
demonstrable errors in the Sacred Writings should fault our doctrine that, as the Word of God,
the Bible is free from all and every error? In every instance the dreaded concession, when
found at length to be enforced by modern learning, has been found to bring, not the loss that
had been apprehended, but clear gain to the intellectual interests of religion. Now it is this
same sort of question which returns with the uncertainties and difficulties widely felt in
the Church to be gathering over its hitherto unvexed belief in miracles as signs of a divine
activity more immediate than it has recognized in the regular processes of Nature.

The majority of uneducated Christians still hold, as formerly in each of the points just mentioned,
to the traditional view. Miracle as a divine intervention in the natural order, a more close
and direct divine contact with the course of things than is the case in ordinary experience,
they regard as the inseparable and necessary concomitant and proof of a divine Revelation.
To deny miracles, thus understood, is censured as equivalent to denial of the reality of the
Revelation. But it is rather surprising, because it is rare, to find a man of such note in
literature as Dr. W. Robertson Nicoll affirming[35] that one cannot be a Christian without
believing at least two miracles, the virgin birth and the physical resurrection of the Christ.
Without comment on the significance of this retreat upon the minimum of miracle, it must here
be noted that a minority of the Church, not inferior to their brethren in learning and piety,
believe that there are no tides in God's presence in Nature, that his contact with it is always
of the closest:--

    "Closer is he than breathing, and nearer than hands or feet."

All natural operations are to them divine operations. "Nature," said Dr. Martineau, "is God's
mask, not his competitor." While his agency in Nature may be recognized at one time more than
at another, it exists at any time fully as much as at any other. In the interest of this fundamental
truth of religion they affirm that miracles in the traditional sense of the word, and in their
traditional limitation to the small measure of time and space covered by Biblical narratives,
never occurred. Events reputed miraculous have indeed occurred, but simply as unusual, inexplicable
phenomena in the natural order of things, the natural products of exceptionally endowed life,
and, whether in ancient time or modern, the same sort of thing the world over. To the argument
that this involves denial of a supernatural Revelation they reply that it is mere reasoning
in a circle. For if one begs the question at the outset by defining supernatural Revelation
as revelation necessarily evidenced by miraculous divine intervention, then, of course, denial
of this is denial of that, and how is the argument advanced? But, besides this, the question-begging
definition is a fallacious confusing of the contents of the Revelation with its concomitants,
and of its essentially spiritual character with phenomena in the sphere of the senses.
