Genius in writing spontaneously arose; and, though neglected by the great, flourished under
the culture of a public which had pretensions to taste, and piqued itself on encouraging literary
merit. Swift and Pope we have mentioned on another occasion. Young still survived, a venerable
monument of poetical talents. Thomson, the poet of the Seasons, displayed a luxuriancy of genius
in describing the beauties of nature. Akenside and Armstrong excelled in didactic poetry. Even
the Epopoea did not disdain an English dress; but appeared to advantage in the Leonidas of
Glover, and the Epigoniad of Wilkie. The public acknowledged a considerable share of dramatic
merit in the tragedies of Young, Mallet, Home, and some other less distinguished authors. Very
few regular comedies, during this period, were exhibited on the English theatre; which, however,
produced many less laboured pieces, abounding with satire, wit, and humour. The Careless Husband
of Gibber, and Suspicious Husband of Hoadley, are the only comedies of this age that bid fair
for reaching posterity. The exhibitions of the stage were improved to the most exquisite entertainment
by the talents and management of Garrick, who greatly surpassed all his predecessors of this
and perhaps every other nation, in his genius for acting; in the sweetness and variety of his
tones, the irresistible magic of his eye, the fire and vivacity of his action, the elegance
of attitude, and the whole pathos of expression. Quin excelled in dignity and declamation,
as well as exhibiting some characters of humour, equally exquisite and peculiar. Mrs. Cibber
breathed the whole soul of female tenderness and passion; and Mrs. Pritchard displayed all
the dignity of distress. That Great Britain was not barren of poets at this period, appears
from the detached performances of Johnson, Mason, Gray, the two Whiteheads, and the two Whartons;
besides a great number of other bards, who have sported in lyric poetry, and acquired the applause
of their fellow-citizens. Candidates for literary fame appeared even in the higher sphere of
life, embellished by the nervous style, superior sense, and extensive erudition of a Corke;
by the delicate taste, the polished muse, and tender feelings of a Lyttleton. Nor let us forget
the merit conspicuous in the works of Campbell, remarkable for candour, intelligence, and precision.
Johnson, inferior to none in philosophy, philology, poetry, and classical learning, stands
foremost as an essayist, justly admired for the dignity, strength, and variety of his style,
as well as for the agreeable manner in which he investigates the human heart, tracing every
interesting emotion, and opening all the sources of morality. The laudable aim of enlisting
the passions on the side of virtue, was successfully pursued by Richardson, in his Pamella,
Clarissa, and Grandison; a species of writing equally new and extraordinary, where, mingled
with much superfluity, we find a sublime system of ethics, an amazing knowledge and command
of human nature. Many of the Greek and Roman classics made their appearance in English translations,
which were favourably received as works of merit; among these we place, after Pope's Homer,
Virgil by Pitt and Wharton, Horace by Francis, Polybius by Hampton, and Sophocles by Franklin. Ever i

None of the rest whom we have named enjoyed any share of the royal bounty, except W. Whitehead,
who succeeded to the place of laureate at the death of Cibber; and some of them whose merit
was the most universally acknowledged, remained exposed to all the storms of indigence, and
all the stings of mortification. While the queen lived, some countenance was given to learning.
She conversed with Newton, and corresponded with Leibnitz. She took pains to acquire popularity;
the royal family on certain days dined in public, for the satisfaction of the people: the court
was animated with a freedom of spirit and vivacity, which rendered it at once brilliant and
agreeable. At her death that spirit began to languish, and a total stagnation of gaiety and
good humour ensued. It was succeeded by a sudden calm, an ungracious reserve, and a still rotation
of insipid forms. *

MUSIC.

England was not defective in other arts that embellish and amuse. Music became a fashionable
study, and its professors were generally caressed by the public. An Italian opera was maintained
at a great expense, and well supplied with foreign performers. Private concerts were instituted
in every corner of the metropolis. The compositions of Handel were universally admired, and
he himself lived in affluence. It must be owned at the same time, that Geminiani was neglected,
though his genius commanded esteem and veneration. Among the few natives of England who distinguished
themselves by their talents in this art, Green, Howard, Arne, and Boyce, were the most remarkable.

PAINTING AND SCULPTURE.

The British soil, which had hitherto been barren in the article of painting, now produced some
artists of extraordinary merit. Hogarth excelled all the world in exhibiting the scenes of
ordinary life; in humour, character, and expression. Hayman became eminent for historical designs
and conversation pieces. Reynolds and Ramsay distinguished themselves by their superior merit
in portraits; a branch that was successfully cultivated by many other English painters. Wootton
was famous for representing live animals in general; Seymour for race-horses; Lambert and the
Smiths for landscapes; and Scot for sea-pieces. Several spirited attempts were made on historical
subjects, but little progress was made in the sublime parts of painting. Essays of this kind
were discouraged by a false taste, founded upon a reprobation of British genius. The art of
engraving was brought to perfection by Strange, and laudably practised by Grignon, Baron, Ravenet,
and several other masters; great improvements were made in mezzotinto, miniature, and enamel.
Many fair monuments of sculpture or statuary were raised by Rysbrach, Roubilliac, and Wilton.
Architecture, which had been cherished by the elegant taste of Burlington, soon became a favourite
study; and many magnificent edifices were reared in different parts of the kingdom. Ornaments
were carved in wood, and moulded in stucco, with all the delicacy of execution; but a passion
for novelty had introduced into gardening, building, and furniture, an absurd Chinese taste,
equally void of beauty and convenience. Improvements in the liberal and useful arts will doubtless
be the consequence of that encouragement given to merit by the society instituted for these
purposes, which we have described on another occasion. As for the Royal Society, it seems to
have degenerated in its researches, and to have had very little share, for half a century at
least, in extending the influence of true philosophy.

We shall conclude this reign with a detail of the forces and fleets of Great Britain, from
whence the reader will conceive a just idea of her opulence and power.

NOTES TO VOLUME II.

[Footnote 237: Note 2 K, p.237 Nothing was heard within doors in parliament, but sarcastic
repartee and violent declamation between the two parties, who did not confine their altercation
to these debates, but took the field against each other in periodical papers and occasional
pamphlets. The paper called The Craftsman, had already risen into high reputation all over
England, for the wit, humour, and solid reasoning it contained. Some of the best writers in
the opposition, including lord Bolingbroke and Mr. P. made use of this vehicle to convey their
animadversions upon the minister, who, on his side, employed the most wretched scribblers to
defend his conduct. It was in consequence of two political pamphlets, written in opposition
to each other, by "lord Hervey and Mr. P., and some recrimination they produced in the house
of commons, that his lordship challenged the other to single combat, and had well nigh lost
his life in the duel, which was fought in Hyde Park.]

[Footnote 260: Note 2. L, p. 260. Captain Jenkins was master of a Scottish merchant-ship. He
was boarded by the captain of a Spanish guardacosta, who treated him in the most barbarous
manner. The Spaniards, after having rummaged his vessel for what they called contraband commodities,
without finding anything to justify their search, insulted him with the most opprobrious invectives.
They tore off one of his ears, bidding him carry it to his king, and tell him they would serve
him in the same manner should an opportunity offer: they tortured him with the most shocking
cruelty, and threatened him with immediate death. This man was examined at the bar of the house
of commons, and being asked by a member, what he thought when he found himself in the hands
of such barbarians? "I recommended my soul to God," said he, "and my cause to my country."
The behaviour of this brave seaman, the sight of his ear, which was produced, with his account
of the indignities which had been offered to the nation and sovereign of Great Britain, filled
the whole house with indignation. Jenkins was afterwards employed in the service of the East
India company; he approved himself worthy of his good fortune, in a long engagement with the
pirate Angria, during which he behaved with extraordinary courage and conduct; and saved his
own ship, with three others that were under his convoy.]

[Footnote 262: Note 2 M, p. 262. Among the laws enacted in the course of this session was an
act against gaming, which had become universal through all ranks of people, and likely to prove
destructive to all morals, industry, and sentiment. Another bill passed, for granting a reward
to Joanna Stevens, on her discovering, for the benefit of the public, a nostrum for the cure
of persons afflicted with the stone--a medicine which has by no means answered the expectations
of the legislature.

In the house of lords, complaint was made by lord Delaware of a satire, entitled Manners, written
by Mr. Whitehead, in which some characters of distinction were severely lashed in the true
spirit of poetry. It was voted a libel: a motion was made to take the author into custody;
but he having withdrawn himself, the resentment of the house fell upon E. Dodsley, the publisher
of the work, who was committed to the usher of the black rod, though lord Carteret, the earl
of Abingdon, and lord Talbot, spoke in his behalf.]

[Footnote 283: Note 2 N, p.283. In May, a dreadful plague broke out at Messina in Sicily. It
was imported in cotton and other commodities brought from the Morea; and swept off such a multitude
of people, that the city was almost depopulated: all the galley slaves who were employed in
burying the dead, perished by the contagion; and this was the fate of many priests and monks
who administered to those who were infected. The dead bodies lay in heaps in the streets, corrupting
the air, and adding fresh fuel to the rage of the pestilence. Numbers died miserably, for want
of proper attendance and necessaries; and all was horror and desolation. At the beginning of
winter it ceased, after having destroyed near fifty thousand inhabitants of Messina, and of
the garrisons in the citadel and castle. It was prevented from spreading in Sicily by a strong
barricado drawn from Melazzo to Taormina; but it was conveyed to Reggio in Calabria by the
avarice of a broker of that place, who bought some goods at Messina. The king of Naples immediately
ordered lines to be formed, together with a chain of troops, which cut off all communication
between that place and the rest of the continent.]

 For this
purpose Ins majesty was enabled to borrow of any person or persons, bodies politic or corporate,
any sum or sums of money not exceeding that part of the national debt which might remain unsubscribed,
to be charged on the sinking fund, upon any terms not exceeding the rate of interest in the
foregoing proposal.

All the duties appropriated to the payment of the interest were still continued, and the surplus
of these incorporated with the sinking fund for the discharge of the principal. Books were
opened for the subscription at the Exchequer, the Bank of England, and the South Sea house;
and copies of these resolutions transmitted to the directors of all the monied corporations.]

[Footnote 322: Note 2 R, p. 322. The most remarkable circumstance attending the progress of
this bill, which made its way through both houses, and obtained the royal assent, was the number
of contradictory petitions in favour and in prejudice of it, while it remained under consideration.
The tanners of leather in and about the town of Sheffield in Yorkshire, represented, That if
the bill should pass, the English iron would be undersold; consequently, a great number of
furnaces and forges would be discontinued; in that case the woods used for fuel would stand
uncut, and the tanners be deprived of oak bark sufficient for the continuance and support of
their occupation. They nevertheless owned, that should the duty be removed from pig iron only,
no such consequence could be apprehended; because, should the number of furnaces be lessened,
that of forges would be increased. This was likewise the plea urged in divers remonstrances
by masters of iron-works, gentlemen, and freeholders, who had tracts of wood-land in their
possession. The owners, proprietors, and farmers of furnaces and iron forges, belonging to
Sheffield and its neighbourhood, enlarged upon the great expense they had incurred in erecting
and supporting iron-works, by means of which great numbers of his majesty's subjects were comfortably
supported. They expressed their apprehension, that should the bill pass into a law, it could
not in any degree lessen the consumption of Swedish iron, which was used for purposes which
neither the American nor British iron would answer; but that the proposed encouragement, considering
the plenty and cheapness of wood in America, would enable the colonies to undersell the British
iron, a branch of traffic which would be totally destroyed, to the ruin of many thousand labourers,
who would be compelled to seek their livelihood in foreign countries. They likewise suggested,
that if all the iron manufacturers of Great Britain should be obliged to depend upon a supply
of iron from the plantations, which must ever be rendered precarious by the hazard of the seas
and the enemy, the manufactures would probably decay for want of materials, and many thousand
families be reduced to want and misery. On the other hand, the ironmongers and smiths belonging
to the flourishing town of Birmingham in Warwickshire, presented a petition, declaring, That
the bill would be of great benefit to the trade of the nation, as it would enable the colonists
to make larger returns of their own produce, and encourage them to take a greater quantity
of the British manufactures. They affirmed, that all the iron-works in the island of Great
Britain did not supply half the quantity of that metal sufficient to carry on the manufacture;
that if this deficiency could be supplied from the colonies in America, the importation would
cease, and considerable sums of money be saved to the nation. They observed, that the importation
of iron from America could no more affect the iron-works and freeholders of the kingdom, than
the like quantity imported from any other country; but they prayed that the people of America
might be restrained from erecting slitting or rolling-mills, or forges for plating iron, as
they would interfere with the manufacturers of Great Britain.

Many remonstrances to the same effect were presented from different parts of the kingdom, and
it appeared, upon the most exact inquiry, that the encouragement of American iron would prove
extremely beneficial to the kingdom, as it had been found, upon trial, applicable to all the
uses of Swedish iron, and as good in every respect as the produce of that country.]

[Footnote 330: Note 2 S, p. 330. One of the most remarkable acts which passed in the course
of this session, was that for regulating the commencement of the year, and correcting the calendar,
according to the Gregorian computation, which had been adopted by all other nations in Europe.
By this new law it was decreed that the new year should begin on the 1st day of January, and
that eleven intermediate nominal days, between the second and fourteenth days of September,
1752, should for that time be omitted; so that the day succeeding the second should be denominated
the fourteenth of that month. By this establishment of the new style, the equinoxes and solstices
will happen nearly on the same nominal days on which they fell in the year 325, at the council
of Nice; and the correspondence between the English merchants and those of foreign countries
will be greatly facilitated, with respect to the dates of letters and accounts.]

[Footnote 331: Note 2 T, p. 330. An indulgent parent was poisoned by his only daughter, on
whom, besides other marks of tenderness and paternal affection, he had bestowed a liberal education,
which greatly aggravated her guilt and ingratitude. Another young woman was concerned in the
assassination of her own uncle, who had been her constant benefactor and sole guardian. A poor
old woman, having, from the ignorance and superstition of her neighbours, incurred the suspicion
of sorcery and witchcraft, was murdered in Hertfordshire by the populace, with all the wantonness
of barbarity. Rape and murder were perpetrated upon an unfortunate woman in the neighbourhood
of London, and an innocent man suffered death for this complicated outrage, while the real
criminals assisted at his execution, heard him appeal to heaven for his innocence, and, in
the character of friends, embraced him, while he stood on the brink of eternity.]

[Footnote 348: Note 2 U, p. 348. Several European nations had settlements at Surat, which was
one of the most frequented cities of the East, from the great concourse of Mahometan pilgrims,
who make it their road from India, in their visits to the tomb of their prophet at Mecca. In
order to keep the seas clear of pirates between Surat and the gulf of Arabia and Persia, the
mogul had been at the annual expense of a large ship, fitted out on purpose to carry the pilgrims
to Judda, which is within a small distance of Mecca. For the security of this ship, as well
as to protect the trade of Surat, he granted to his admiral, the fiddee, chief of a colony
of caffrees, or blacks, a revenue called the tanka, to the value of three lacks of rupees,
amounting to above thirty-seven thousand pounds, arising partly from the adjacent lands, and
partly from the revenues of Surat, which were paid him yearly by the governor of the castle,
who is appointed by the mogul to keep the city under proper subjection, without, however, interfering
with the government of it.]

[Footnote 357: Note 2 X, p. 357. The ministry having resolved to send a body of forces to America,
to act in conjunction with the provincial troops raised on that continent, it became necessary
that the mutiny act should be rendered more clear and extensive. When this bill, therefore,
fell under consideration, it was improved with a new clause, providing, "That all officers
and soldiers of any troops being mustered and in pay, which are or shall be raised in any of
the British provinces in America, by authority of the respective governors or governments thereof,
shall at all times, and in all places, when they happen to join or act in conjunction with
his majesty's British forces, be liable to martial law and discipline, in like manner, to all
intents and purposes, as the British forces are; and shall be subject to the same trial, penalties,
and punishment."]

[Footnote 364: Note 2 Y, p. 364. The king, on his side, promised to pay to the landgrave, for
these succours, eighty crowns banco, by way of levy-money, for every trooper or dragoon duly
armed and mounted, and thirty crowns banco for every foot soldier; the crown to be reckoned
at fifty-three sols of Holland, or at four shillings and ninepence three farthings English
money; and also to pay to his serene highness, for the eight thousand men, an annual subsidy
of an hundred and fifty thousand crowns banco, during the four years, to commence from the
day of signing the treaty; which subsidy was to be increased to three hundred thousand crowns
yearly, from the time of requiring the troops, to the time of their entering into British pay;
and in case of their being dismissed, the said subsidy of three hundred thousand crowns was
then to revive and be continued during the residue of the term: but, if twelve thousand men
were demanded and furnished, the subsidy was then to be increased in proportion; and in case
the king of Great Britain should at any time think fit to send back these troops before the
expiration of the treaty, notice thereof was to be given to his serene highness three months
beforehand: one month's pay was to be allowed them for their return, and they were to be furnished
gratis with the necessary transport vessels.]

[Footnote 372: Note 2 Z, p. 372. It is with pleasure we seize this opportunity of recording
an instance of gallantry and patriotism in a British officer, which would have done honour
to the character of a Roman tribune. Captain Cunningham, an accomplished young gentleman, who
acted as engineer in second at Minorca, being preferred to a majority at home, and recalled
to his regiment by an express order, had repaired with his family to Nice in Italy, where he
waited for the opportunity of a ship bound for England, when he received certain intelligence
that the French armament was destined for the place he had quitted. His lady, whom he tenderly
loved, was just delivered, and two of his children were dangerously ill of the small-pox. He
recollected that the chief engineer at Minorca was infirm, and indeed disabled by the gout,
and that many things were wanting for the defence of the fortress. His zeal for the honour
and service of his country immediately triumphed over the calls of tenderness and of nature.
He expended a considerable sum of money in purchasing timber for the platforms, and other necessaries
for the garrison; hired a ship for transporting them thither; and tearing himself from his
wife and children, thus left among strangers in a foreign country, embarked again for Minorca,
where he knew he should be in a peculiar manner exposed to all the dangers of a furious siege.
In the course of this desperate service he acquitted himself with that vigilance, skill, and
active courage, which he had on divers former occasions displayed, until the assault was given
to the queen's bastion; when, mixing with the enemy, sword in hand, he was disabled in his
right arm by the shot of a musket and the thrust of a bayonet. His behaviour was so acceptable
to his sovereign, that when he returned to England he was preferred to the rank of colonel
in the Guards. He afterwards acted as chief engineer in the attempts and descents which were
made on the French coast. Though grievously maimed, he accepted the same office in the expedition
to Guadaloupe, where he died universally regretted.]

[Footnote 378: Note 3 A, p. 378. When the French ambassador returned to London, he proposed
that orders should be immediately despatched to the English governors in America, with express
orders to desist from any new undertaking, and all acts of hostility; but with regard to the
lands on the Ohio, to put, without delay, matters on the same footing in which they stood before
the late war, that the respective claims of both nations might be amicably referred to the
commissaries at Paris. The British court agreed to the cessation of hostilities, and the discussion
of the disputes by the ministers of the two crowns, on condition that all the possessions in
America should be previously put in the situation prescribed by the treaty of Utrecht, confirmed
by that of Aix-la-Chapelle. The French ministry, instead of complying with this condition,
produced an evasive draft of a preliminary convention, and this was answered by a counter-proposal.
At length the ambassador of France demanded, as preliminary conditions, that Great Britain
would renounce all claim to the south coast of the river St. Laurence, and the lakes that discharge
themselves into that river; cede to the French twenty leagues of country lying along the river
of Fundy, which discovers Acadia, or Nova Scotia; and all the land between the rivers Ohio
and Ouabache. A memorial was afterwards presented on the same subject, including the affairs
of the neutral islands in the West Indies; but this was amply refuted in another piece, in
which the British ministry observed, that even at this very opening of the commission established
in Paris, for terminating amicably the disputes in North America, the French invaded Nova Scotia,
erected three forts in the heart of that province, and would have destroyed the English settlement
at Halifax, had they not been prevented: that the like hostilities were committed upon his
Britannic majesty's subjects on the Ohio and Indian lakes, where the governors appointed by
the French king, without any shadow of right, prohibited the English from trading; seized their
traders by force, and sent them prisoners to France; invaded the territories of Virginia, attacked
a fort that covered its frontier, and, to secure their usurpations, erected, with an armed
force, a chain of forts on the lands which they had invaded; that his Britannic majesty had
complained of these hostilities to the court of Versailles, but without effect; so that he
found himself obliged to provide for the security of his subjects; and as the encroachments
made by France were hostile, it could never be unlawful, or irreconcile-able with the assurance
of his majesty's peaceable disposition, to repel an aggressor; and that the same motive of
self-defence had forced him to seize the French ships and sailors, in order to deprive that
court of the means of making an invasion, with which their ministers in all the courts of Europe
had menaced England.]

highness the duke of Cumberland's commands, to desire that you will keep your garrison as alert
