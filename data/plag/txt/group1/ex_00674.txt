Just after this, while Mr. Turnbull was still going on with a variety of illustrations drawn
from the United States, Barrington Erle stepped across the benches up to the place where Phineas
was sitting, and whispered a few words into his ear. "Bonteen is prepared to answer Turnbull,
and wishes to do it. I told him that I thought you should have the opportunity, if you wish
it." Phineas was not ready with a reply to Erle at the spur of the moment. "Somebody told me,"
continued Erle, "that you had said that you would like to speak to-night."

"So I did," said Phineas.

"Shall I tell Bonteen that you will do it?"

The chamber seemed to swim round before our hero's eyes. Mr. Turnbull was still going on with
his clear, loud, unpleasant voice, but there was no knowing how long he might go on. Upon Phineas,
if he should now consent, might devolve the duty, within ten minutes, within three minutes,
of rising there before a full House to defend his great friend, Mr. Monk, from a gross personal
attack. Was it fit that such a novice as he should undertake such a work as that? Were he to
do so, all that speech which he had prepared, with its various self-floating parts, must go
for nothing. The task was exactly that which, of all tasks, he would best like to have accomplished,
and to have accomplished well. But if he should fail! And he felt that he would fail. For such
work a man should have all his senses about him,--his full courage, perfect confidence, something
almost approaching to contempt for listening opponents, and nothing of fear in regard to listening
friends. He should be as a cock in his own farmyard, master of all the circumstances around
him. But Phineas Finn had not even as yet heard the sound of his own voice in that room. At
this moment, so confused was he, that he did not know where sat Mr. Mildmay, and where Mr.
Daubeny. All was confused, and there arose as it were a sound of waters in his ears, and a
feeling as of a great hell around him. "I had rather wait," he said at last. "Bonteen had better
reply." Barrington Erle looked into his face, and then stepping back across the benches, told
Mr. Bonteen that the opportunity was his.

Mr. Turnbull continued speaking quite long enough to give poor Phineas time for repentance;
but repentance was of no use. He had decided against himself, and his decision could not be
reversed. He would have left the House, only it seemed to him that had he done so every one
would look at him. He drew his hat down over his eyes, and remained in his place, hating Mr.
Bonteen, hating Barrington Erle, hating Mr. Turnbull,--but hating no one so much as he hated
himself. He had disgraced himself for ever and could never recover the occasion which he had lost.

Mr. Bonteen's speech was in no way remarkable. Mr. Monk, he said, had done the State good service
by adding his wisdom and patriotism to the Cabinet. The sort of argument which Mr. Bonteen
used to prove that a man who has gained credit as a legislator should in process of time become
a member of the executive, is trite and common, and was not used by Mr. Bonteen with any special
force. Mr. Bonteen was glib of tongue and possessed that familiarity with the place which poor
Phineas had lacked so sorely. There was one moment, however, which was terrible to Phineas.
As soon as Mr. Bonteen had shown the purpose for which he was on his legs, Mr. Monk looked
round at Phineas, as though in reproach. He had expected that this work should fall into the
hands of one who would perform it with more warmth of heart than could be expected from Mr.
Bonteen. When Mr. Bonteen ceased, two or three other short speeches were made and members fired
off their little guns. Phineas having lost so great an opportunity, would not now consent to
accept one that should be comparatively valueless. Then there came a division. The motion was
lost by a large majority,--by any number you might choose to name, as Phineas had said to Lord
Brentford; but in that there was no triumph to the poor wretch who had failed through fear,
and who was now a coward in his own esteem.

He left the House alone, carefully avoiding all speech with any one. As he came out he had
seen Laurence Fitzgibbon in the lobby, but he had gone on without pausing a moment, so that
he might avoid his friend. And when he was out in Palace Yard, where was he to go next? He
looked at his watch, and found that it was just ten. He did not dare to go to his club, and
it was impossible for him to go home and to bed. He was very miserable, and nothing would comfort
him but sympathy. Was there any one who would listen to his abuse of himself, and would then
answer him with kindly apologies for his own weakness? Mrs. Bunce would do it if she knew how,
but sympathy from Mrs. Bunce would hardly avail. There was but one person in the world to whom
he could tell his own humiliation with any hope of comfort, and that person was Lady Laura
Kennedy. Sympathy from any man would have been distasteful to him. He had thought for a moment
of flinging himself at Mr. Monk's feet and telling all his weakness;--but he could not have
endured pity even from Mr. Monk. It was not to be endured from any man.

He thought that Lady Laura Kennedy would be at home, and probably alone. He knew, at any rate,
that he might be allowed to knock at her door, even at that hour. He had left Mr. Kennedy in
the House, and there he would probably remain for the next hour. There was no man more constant
than Mr. Kennedy in seeing the work of the day,--or of the night,--to its end. So Phineas walked
up Victoria Street, and from thence into Grosvenor Place, and knocked at Lady Laura's door.
"Yes; Lady Laura was at home; and alone." He was shown up into the drawing-room, and there
he found Lady Laura waiting for her husband.

"So the great debate is over," she said, with as much of irony as she knew how to throw into
the epithet.

"Yes; it is over."

"And what have they done,--those leviathans of the people?"

Then Phineas told her what was the majority.

"Is there anything the matter with you, Mr. Finn?" she said, looking at him suddenly. "Are
you not well?"

"Yes; I am very well."

"Will you not sit down? There is something wrong, I know. What is it?"

"I have simply been the greatest idiot, the greatest coward, the most awkward ass that ever lived!"

"What do you mean?"

"I do not know why I should come to tell you of it at this hour at night, but I have come that
I might tell you. Probably because there is no one else in the whole world who would not laugh
at me."

"At any rate, I shall not laugh at you," said Lady Laura.

"But you will despise me."

"That I am sure I shall not do."

"You cannot help it. I despise myself. For years I have placed before myself the ambition of
speaking in the House of Commons;--for years I have been thinking whether there would ever
come to me an opportunity of making myself heard in that assembly, which I consider to be the
first in the world. To-day the opportunity has been offered to me,--and, though the motion
was nothing, the opportunity was great. The subject was one on which I was thoroughly prepared.
The manner in which I was summoned was most flattering to me. I was especially called on to
perform a task which was most congenial to my feelings;--and I declined because I was afraid."

"You had thought too much about it, my friend," said Lady Laura.

"Too much or too little, what does it matter?" replied Phineas, in despair. "There is the fact.
I could not do it. Do you remember the story of Conachar in the 'Fair Maid of Perth;'--how
his heart refused to give him blood enough to fight? He had been suckled with the milk of a
timid creature, and, though he could die, there was none of the strength of manhood in him.
It is about the same thing with me, I take it."

"I do not think you are at all like Conachar," said Lady Laura.

"I am equally disgraced, and I must perish after the same fashion. I shall apply for the Chiltern
Hundreds in a day or two."

"You will do nothing of the kind," said Lady Laura, getting up from her chair and coming towards
him. "You shall not leave this room till you have promised me that you will do nothing of the
kind. I do not know as yet what has occurred to-night; but I do know that that modesty which
has kept you silent is more often a grace than a disgrace."

This was the kind of sympathy which he wanted, She drew her chair nearer to him, and then he
explained to her as accurately as he could what had taken place in the House on this evening,--how
he had prepared his speech, how he had felt that his preparation was vain, how he perceived
from the course of the debate that if he spoke at all his speech must be very different from
what he had first intended; how he had declined to take upon himself a task which seemed to
require so close a knowledge of the ways of the House and of the temper of the men, as the
defence of such a man as Mr. Monk. In accusing himself he, unconsciously, excused himself,
and his excuse, in Lady Laura's ears, was more valid than his accusation.

"And you would give it all up for that?" she said.

"Yes; I think I ought."

"I have very little doubt but that you were right in allowing Mr. Bonteen to undertake such
a task. I should simply explain to Mr. Monk that you felt too keen an interest in his welfare
to stand up as an untried member in his defence. It is not, I think, the work for a man who
is not at home in the House. I am sure Mr. Monk will feel this, and I am quite certain that
Mr. Kennedy will think that you have been right."

"I do not care what Mr. Kennedy may think."

"Why do you say that, Mr. Finn? That is not courteous."

"Simply because I care so much what Mr. Kennedy's wife may think. Your opinion is all in all
to me,--only that I know you are too kind to me."

"He would not be too kind to you. He is never too kind to any one. He is justice itself."

Phineas, as he heard the tones of her voice, could not but feel that there was in Lady Laura's
words something of an accusation against her husband.

"I hate justice," said Phineas. "I know that justice would condemn me. But love and friendship
know nothing of justice. The value of love is that it overlooks faults, and forgives even crimes."

 He had
spoken to his friend Laurence, and Laurence had simply assured him that all should be made
right in two days,--or, at furthest, by the end of a week. Since that time he had observed
that his friend had been somewhat shy of speaking to him when no others were with them. Phineas
would not have alluded to the bill had he and Laurence been alone together; but he had been
quick enough to guess from his friend's manner that the matter was not settled. Now, no doubt,
serious trouble was about to commence.

The visitor was a little man with grey hair and a white cravat, some sixty years of age, dressed
in black, with a very decent hat,--which, on entering the room, he at once put down on the
nearest chair,--with reference to whom, any judge on the subject would have concurred at first
sight in the decision pronounced by Mrs. Bunce, though none but a judge very well used to sift
the causes of his own conclusions could have given the reasons for that early decision. "He
ain't a gentleman," Mrs. Bunce had said. And the man certainly was not a gentleman. The old
man in the white cravat was very neatly dressed, and carried himself without any of that humility
which betrays one class of uncertified aspirants to gentility, or of that assumed arrogance
which is at once fatal to another class. But, nevertheless, Mrs. Bunce had seen at a glance
that he was not a gentleman,--had seen, moreover, that such a man could have come only upon
one mission. She was right there too. This visitor had come about money.

"About this bill, Mr. Finn," said the visitor, proceeding to take out of his breast coat-pocket
a rather large leathern case, as he advanced up towards the fire. "My name is Clarkson, Mr.
Finn. If I may venture so far, I'll take a chair."

"Certainly, Mr. Clarkson," said Phineas, getting up and pointing to a seat.

"Thankye, Mr. Finn, thankye. We shall be more comfortable doing business sitting, shan't we?"
Whereupon the horrid little man drew himself close in to the fire, and spreading out his leathern
case upon his knees, began to turn over one suspicious bit of paper after another, as though
he were uncertain in what part of his portfolio lay this identical bit which he was seeking.
He seemed to be quite at home, and to feel that there was no ground whatever for hurry in such
comfortable quarters. Phineas hated him at once,--with a hatred altogether unconnected with
the difficulty which his friend Fitzgibbon had brought upon him.

"Here it is," said Mr. Clarkson at last. "Oh, dear me, dear me! the third of November, and
here we are in March! I didn't think it was so bad as this;--I didn't indeed. This is very
bad,--very bad! And for Parliament gents, too, who should be more punctual than anybody, because
of the privilege. Shouldn't they now, Mr. Finn?"

"All men should be punctual, I suppose," said Phineas.

"Of course they should; of course they should. I always say to my gents, 'Be punctual, and
I'll do anything for you.' But, perhaps, Mr. Finn, you can hand me a cheque for this amount,
and then you and I will begin square."

"Indeed I cannot, Mr. Clarkson."

"Not hand me a cheque for it!"

"Upon my word, no."

"That's very bad;--very bad indeed. Then I suppose I must take the half, and renew for the
remainder, though I don't like it;--I don't indeed."

"I can pay no part of that bill, Mr. Clarkson."

"Pay no part of it!" and Mr. Clarkson, in order that he might the better express his surprise,
arrested his hand in the very act of poking his host's fire.

"If you'll allow me, I'll manage the fire," said Phineas, putting out his hand for the poker.

But Mr. Clarkson was fond of poking fires, and would not surrender the poker. "Pay no part
of it!" he said again, holding the poker away from Phineas in his left hand. "Don't say that,
Mr. Finn. Pray don't say that. Don't drive me to be severe. I don't like to be severe with
my gents. I'll do anything, Mr. Finn, if you'll only be punctual."

"The fact is, Mr. Clarkson, I have never had one penny of consideration for that bill, and--"

"Oh, Mr. Finn! oh, Mr. Finn!" and then Mr. Clarkson had his will of the fire.

"I never had one penny of consideration for that bill," continued Phineas. "Of course, I don't
deny my responsibility."

"No, Mr. Finn; you can't deny that. Here it is;--Phineas Finn;--and everybody knows you, because
you're a Parliament gent."

"I don't deny it. But I had no reason to suppose that I should be called upon for the money
when I accommodated my friend, Mr. Fitzgibbon, and I have not got it. That is the long and
the short of it. I must see him and take care that arrangements are made."

"Arrangements!"

"Yes, arrangements for settling the bill."

"He hasn't got the money, Mr. Finn. You know that as well as I do."

"I know nothing about it, Mr. Clarkson."

"Oh yes, Mr. Finn; you know; you know."

"I tell you I know nothing about it," said Phineas, waxing angry.

"As to Mr. Fitzgibbon, he's the pleasantest gent that ever lived. Isn't he now? I've know'd
him these ten years. I don't suppose that for ten years I've been without his name in my pocket.
But, bless you, Mr. Finn, there's an end to everything. I shouldn't have looked at this bit
of paper if it hadn't been for your signature. Of course not. You're just beginning, and it's
natural you should want a little help. You'll find me always ready, if you'll only be punctual."

"I tell you again, sir, that I never had a shilling out of that for myself, and do not want
any such help." Here Mr. Clarkson smiled sweetly. "I gave my name to my friend simply to oblige
him."

"I like you Irish gents because you do hang together so close," said Mr. Clarkson.

"Simply to oblige him," continued Phineas. "As I said before, I know that I am responsible;
but, as I said before also, I have not the means of taking up that bill. I will see Mr. Fitzgibbon,
and let you know what we propose to do." Then Phineas got up from his seat and took his hat.
It was full time that he should go down to his Committee. But Mr. Clarkson did not get up from
his seat. "I'm afraid I must ask you to leave me now, Mr. Clarkson, as I have business down
at the House."

"Business at the House never presses, Mr. Finn," said Mr. Clarkson. "That's the best of Parliament.
I've known Parliament gents this thirty years and more. Would you believe it--I've had a Prime
Minister's name in that portfolio; that I have; and a Lord Chancellor's; that I have;--and
an Archbishop's too. I know what Parliament is, Mr. Finn. Come, come; don't put me off with
Parliament."

There he sat before the fire with his pouch open before him, and Phineas had no power of moving
him. Could Phineas have paid him the money which was manifestly due to him on the bill, the
man would of course have gone; but failing in that, Phineas could not turn him out. There was
a black cloud on the young member's brow, and great anger at his heart,--against Fitzgibbon
rather than against the man who was sitting there before him. "Sir," he said, "it is really
imperative that I should go. I am pledged to an appointment at the House at twelve, and it
wants now only a quarter. I regret that your interview with me should be so unsatisfactory,
but I can only promise you that I will see Mr. Fitzgibbon."

"And when shall I call again, Mr. Finn?"

"Perhaps I had better write to you," said Phineas.

"Oh dear, no," said Mr. Clarkson. "I should much prefer to look in. Looking in is always best.
We can get to understand one another in that way. Let me see. I daresay you're not particular.
Suppose I say Sunday morning."

"Really, I could not see you on Sunday morning, Mr. Clarkson."

"Parliament gents ain't generally particular,--'speciaily not among the Catholics," pleaded
Mr. Clarkson.

"I am always engaged on Sundays," said Phineas.

"Suppose we say Monday,--or Tuesday. Tuesday morning at eleven. And do be punctual, Mr. Finn.
At Tuesday morning I'll come, and then no doubt I shall find you ready." Whereupon Mr. Clarkson
slowly put up his bills within his portfolio, and then, before Phineas knew where he was, had
warmly shaken that poor dismayed member of Parliament by the hand. "Only do be punctual, Mr.
Finn," he said, as he made his way down the stairs.

It was now twelve, and Phineas rushed off to a cab. He was in such a fervour of rage and misery
that he could hardly think of his position, or what he had better do, till he got into the
Committee Room; and when there he could think of nothing else. He intended to go deeply into
the question of potted peas, holding an equal balance between the assailed Government offices
on the one hand, and the advocates of the potted peas on the other. The potters of the peas,
who wanted to sell their article to the Crown, declared that an extensive,--perhaps we may
say, an unlimited,--use of the article would save the whole army and navy from the scourges
of scurvy, dyspepsia, and rheumatism, would be the best safeguard against typhus and other
fevers, and would be an invaluable aid in all other maladies to which soldiers and sailors
are peculiarly subject. The peas in question were grown on a large scale in Holstein, and their
growth had been fostered with the special object of doing good to the British army and navy.
The peas were so cheap that there would be a great saving in money,--and it really had seemed
to many that the officials of the Horse Guards and the Admiralty had been actuated by some
fiendish desire to deprive their men of salutary fresh vegetables, simply because they were
of foreign growth. But the officials of the War Office and the Admiralty declared that the
potted peas in question were hardly fit for swine. The motion for the Committee had been made
by a gentleman of the opposition, and Phineas had been put upon it as an independent member.
He had resolved to give it all his mind, and, as far as he was concerned, to reach a just decision,
in which there should be no favour shown to the Government side. New brooms are proverbial
for thorough work, and in this Committee work Phineas was as yet a new broom. But, unfortunately,
on this day his mind was so harassed that he could hardly understand what was going on. It
did not, perhaps, much signify, as the witnesses examined were altogether agricultural. They
only proved the production of peas in Holstein,--a fact as to which Phineas had no doubt. The
proof was naturally slow, as the evidence was given in German, and had to be translated into
English. And the work of the day was much impeded by a certain member who unfortunately spoke
German, who seemed to be fond of speaking German before his brethren of the Committee, and
who was curious as to agriculture in Holstein generally. The chairman did not understand German,
and there was a difficulty in checking this gentleman, and in making him understand that his
questions were not relevant to the issue.
