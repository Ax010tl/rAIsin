 There was a suspicion
that the Nain Rouge had power to change his shape for one not less offensive. The brothers
Tremblay had no luck in fishing through the straits and lakes until one of them agreed to share
his catch with St. Patrick, the saint's half to be sold at the church-door for the benefit
of the poor and for buying masses to relieve souls in purgatory. His brother doubted if this
benefit would last, and feared that they might be lured into the water and turned into fish,
for had not St. Patrick eaten pork chops on a Friday, after dipping them into holy water and
turning them into trout? But his good brother kept on and prospered and the bad one kept on
grumbling. Now, at Grosse Isle was a strange thing called the rolling muff, that all were afraid
of, since to meet it was a warning of trouble; but, like the feu follet, it could be driven
off by holding a cross toward it or by asking it on what day of the month came Christmas. The
worse of the Tremblays encountered this creature and it filled him with dismay. When he returned
his neighbors observed an odor--not of sanctity--on his garments, and their view of the matter
was that he had met a skunk. The graceless man felt convinced, however, that he had received
a devil's baptism from the Nain Rouge, and St. Patrick had no stancher allies than both the
Tremblays, after that.

 The final apotheosis took place on the shores of Lake Onondaga,
New York, though Hiawatha lies buried under a mountain, three miles long, on the east side
of Thunder Bay, Lake Superior, which, from the water, resembles a man lying on his back. The
red man makes oblation, as he rows past, by dropping a pinch of tobacco into the water. Some
say that Hiawatha now lives at the top of the earth, amid the ice, and directs the sun. He
has to live in a cold country because, if he were to return, he would set the earth on fire
with his footsteps.

THE INDIAN MESSIAH

The promise of the return to earth of various benign spirits has caused much trouble among
the red men, and incidentally to the white men who are the objects of their fanatic dislike.
The New Mexicans believed that when the Emperor Montezuma was about to leave the earth he planted
a tree and bade them watch it, for when it fell he would come back in glory and lead them to
victory, wealth, and power. The watch was kept in secret on account of the determination of
the Spaniards to breakup all fealty to tribal heroes and traditions. As late as 1781 they executed
a sentence of death on a descendant of the Peruvian Incas for declaring his royal origin. When
Montezuma's tree fell the people gathered on the house-tops to watch the east-in vain, for
the white man was there. In 1883 the Sanpoels, a small tribe in Washington, were stirred by
the teaching of an old chief, who told them that the wicked would soon be destroyed, and that
the Great Spirit had ordered him to build an ark for his people. The remains of this vessel,
two hundred and eighty-eight feet long, are still to be seen near one of the tributaries of
the Columbia.

This manitou piled the heavy blocks of Devil's Door-Way and set up Black Monument and the Pedestalled
Bowlder as thrones where he might sit and view the landscape by day--for the Indians appreciated
the beautiful in nature and supposed their gods did, too--while at night he could watch the
dance of the frost spirits, the aurora borealis. Cleft Rock was sundered by one of his darts
aimed at an offending Indian, who owed his life to the manitou's bad aim. The Sacrifice Stone
is shown where, at another time, a girl was immolated to appease his anger. Cleopatra's Needle,
as it is now called, is the body of an ancient chief, who was turned into stone as a punishment
for prying into the mysteries of the lake, a stone on East Mountain being the remains of a
squaw who had similarly offended. "of lake, it did not don'it repent them was to earthwork is not

 This quarry was neutral ground,
and here, as they approached it, the men of all tribes sheathed their knives and belted up
their axes, for to this place the Great Spirit came to kill and eat the buffalo, and it is
the blood of this animal that has turned the stone to red. Here, too, the Thunder Bird had
her nest, and her brood rent the skies above it with the clashing of their iron wings.

A snake having crawled into this nest to steal the unhatched thunders, Manitou caught up a
piece of pipestone, hastily pressed it between his hands, giving it the shape of a man, and
flung it at the reptile. The stone man's feet stuck fast in the ground, and there he stood
for a thousand years, growing like a tree and drawing strength and knowledge out of the earth.
Another shape grew up beside him--woman. In time the snake gnawed them free from their foundations
and the red-earth pair wandered off together. From them sprang all people.

With this she turned away and left Red Cloud to his meditations. Wenonah, at the door of her
brother's wigwam, looked into the north and saw the stars grow pale through streams of electric
fire. "The Woman of the North warns us of coming evil," muttered the chief. "Some danger is

Two renegade Chippewas, that had lingered behind the band, played the villain after this pleasant
parting, for they killed a Sioux. Hardly was the news of this outrage received at the fort
ere three hundred warriors were on the trail of their whilom guests and friends, all clamoring
for revenge. Among them was Track Maker, for he could not, as a warrior, remain behind after
his brother had been shot, and, while his heart sank within him as he thought of the gentle
Flying Shadow, he marched in advance, and early in the morning the Chippewas were surprised
