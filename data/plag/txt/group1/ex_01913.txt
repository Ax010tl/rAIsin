We found our hotel in the most perfect of little market squares, with a Renaissance town-hall
on one side, and on the other a miniature Spanish palace with a front of rosy brick adorned
by grey carvings. The square was crowded with English army motors and beautiful prancing chargers;
and the restaurant of the inn (which has the luck to face the pink and grey palace) swarmed
with khaki tea-drinkers turning indifferent shoulders to the widest view in Europe. It is one
of the most detestable things about war that everything connected with it, except the death
and ruin that result, is such a heightening of life, so visually stimulating and absorbing.
"It was gay and terrible," is the phrase forever recurring in "War and Peace"; and the gaiety
of war was everywhere in Cassel, transforming the lifeless little town into a romantic stage-setting
full of the flash of arms and the virile animation of young faces.

From the park on top of the hill we looked down on another picture. All about us was the plain,
its distant rim merged in northern sea-mist; and through the mist, in the glitter of the afternoon
sun, far-off towns and shadowy towers lay steeped, as it seemed, in summer quiet. For a moment,
while we looked, the vision of war shrivelled up like a painted veil; then we caught the names
pronounced by a group of English soldiers leaning over the parapet at our side. "That's Dunkerque"--one
of them pointed it out with his pipe--"and there's Poperinghe, just under us; that's Furnes
beyond, and Ypres and Dixmude, and Nieuport..." And at the mention of those names the scene
grew dark again, and we felt the passing of the Angel to whom was given the Key of the Bottomless
Pit.

That night we went up once more to the rock of Cassel. The moon was full, and as civilians
are not allowed out alone after dark a staff-officer went with us to show us the view from
the roof of the disused Casino on top of the rock. It was the queerest of sensations to push
open a glazed door and find ourselves in a spectral painted room with soldiers dozing in the
moonlight on polished floors, their kits stacked on the gaming tables. We passed through a
big vestibule among more soldiers lounging in the half-light, and up a long staircase to the
roof where a watcher challenged us and then let us go to the edge of the parapet. Directly
below lay the unlit mass of the town. To the northwest a single sharp hill, the "Mont des Cats,"
stood out against the sky; the rest of the horizon was unbroken, and floating in misty moonlight.
The outline of the ruined towns had vanished and peace seemed to have won back the world. But
as we stood there a red flash started out of the mist far off to the northwest; then another
and another flickered up at different points of the long curve. "Luminous bombs thrown up along
the lines," our guide explained; and just then, at still another point a white light opened
like a tropical flower, spread to full bloom and drew itself back into the night. "A flare,"
we were told; and another white flower bloomed out farther down. Below us, the roofs of Cassel
slept their provincial sleep, the moonlight picking out every leaf in the gardens; while beyond,
those infernal flowers continued to open and shut along the curve of death.

June 21st.

On the road from Cassel to Poperinghe. Heat, dust, crowds, confusion, all the sordid shabby
rear-view of war. The road running across the plain between white-powdered hedges was ploughed
up by numberless motor-vans, supply-waggons and Red Cross ambulances. Labouring through between
them came detachments of British artillery, clattering gun-carriages, straight young figures
on glossy horses, long Phidian lines of youths so ingenuously fair that one wondered how they
could have looked on the Medusa face of war and lived. Men and beasts, in spite of the dust,
were as fresh and sleek as if they had come from a bath; and everywhere along the wayside were
improvised camps, with tents made of waggon-covers, where the ceaseless indomitable work of
cleaning was being carried out in all its searching details. Shirts were drying on elder-bushes,
kettles boiling over gypsy fires, men shaving, blacking their boots, cleaning their guns, rubbing
down their horses, greasing their saddles, polishing their stirrups and bits: on all sides
a general cheery struggle against the prevailing dust, discomfort and disorder. Here and there
a young soldier leaned against a garden paling to talk to a girl among the hollyhocks, or an
older soldier initiated a group of children into some mystery of military housekeeping; and
everywhere were the same signs of friendly inarticulate understanding with the owners of the
fields and gardens.

From the thronged high-road we passed into the emptiness of deserted Poperinghe, and out again
on the way to Ypres. Beyond the flats and wind-mills to our left were the invisible German
lines, and the staff-officer who was with us leaned forward to caution our chauffeur: "No tooting
between here and Ypres." There was still a good deal of movement on the road, though it was
less crowded with troops than near Poperinghe; but as we passed through the last village and
approached the low line of houses ahead, the silence and emptiness widened about us. That low
line was Ypres; every monument that marked it, that gave it an individual outline, is gone.
It is a town without a profile.

The motor slipped through a suburb of small brick houses and stopped under cover of some slightly
taller buildings. Another military motor waited there, the chauffeur relic-hunting in the gutted
houses.

We got out and walked toward the centre of the Cloth Market. We had seen evacuated towns--Verdun,
Badonviller, Raon-l'Etape--but we had seen no emptiness like this. Not a human being was in
the streets. Endless lines of houses looked down on us from vacant windows. Our footsteps echoed
like the tramp of a crowd, our lowered voices seemed to shout. In one street we came on three
English soldiers who were carrying a piano out of a house and lifting it onto a hand-cart.
They stopped to stare at us, and we stared back. It seemed an age since we had seen a living
being! One of the soldiers scrambled into the cart and tapped out a tune on the cracked key-board,
and we all laughed with relief at the foolish noise... Then we walked on and were alone again.

We had seen other ruined towns, but none like this. The towns of Lorraine were blown up, burnt
down, deliberately erased from the earth. At worst they are like stone-yards, at best like
Pompeii. But Ypres has been bombarded to death, and the outer walls of its houses are still
standing, so that it presents the distant semblance of a living city, while near by it is seen
to be a disembowelled corpse. Every window-pane is smashed, nearly every building unroofed,
and some house-fronts are sliced clean off, with the different stories exposed, as if for the
stage-setting of a farce. In these exposed interiors the poor little household gods shiver
and blink like owls surprised in a hollow tree. A hundred signs of intimate and humble tastes,
of humdrum pursuits, of family association, cling to the unmasked walls. Whiskered photographs
fade on morning-glory wallpapers, plaster saints pine under glass bells, antimacassars droop
from plush sofas, yellowing diplomas display their seals on office walls. It was all so still
and familiar that it seemed as if the people for whom these things had a meaning might at any
moment come back and take up their daily business. And then--crash! the guns began, slamming
out volley after volley all along the English lines, and the poor frail web of things that
had made up the lives of a vanished city-full hung dangling before us in that deathly blast.

We had just reached the square before the Cathedral when the cannonade began, and its roar
seemed to build a roof of iron over the glorious ruins of Ypres. The singular distinction of
the city is that it is destroyed but not abased. The walls of the Cathedral, the long bulk
of the Cloth Market, still lift themselves above the market place with a majesty that seems
to silence compassion. The sight of those facades, so proud in death, recalled a phrase used
soon after the fall of Liege by Belgium's Foreign Minister--"La Belgique ne regrette rien "--which
ought some day to serve as the motto of the renovated city.

We were turning to go when we heard a whirr overhead, followed by a volley of mitrailleuse.
High up in the blue, over the centre of the dead city, flew a German aeroplane; and all about
it hundreds of white shrapnel tufts burst out in the summer sky like the miraculous snow-fall
of Italian legend. Up and up they flew, on the trail of the Taube, and on flew the Taube, faster
still, till quarry and pack were lost in mist, and the barking of the mitrailleuse died out.
So we left Ypres to the death-silence in which we had found her.

The afternoon carried us back to Poperinghe, where I was bound on a quest for lace-cushions
of the special kind required by our Flemish refugees. The model is unobtainable in France,
and I had been told--with few and vague indications--that I might find the cushions in a certain
convent of the city. But in which?

Poperinghe, though little injured, is almost empty. In its tidy desolation it looks like a
town on which a wicked enchanter has laid a spell. We roamed from quarter to quarter, hunting
for some one to show us the way to the convent I was looking for, till at last a passer-by
led us to a door which seemed the right one. At our knock the bars were drawn and a cloistered
face looked out. No, there were no cushions there; and the nun had never heard of the order
we named. But there were the Penitents, the Benedictines--we might try. Our guide offered to
show us the way and we went on. From one or two windows, wondering heads looked out and vanished;
but the streets were lifeless. At last we came to a convent where there were no nuns left,
but where, the caretaker told us, there were cushions--a great many. He led us through pale
blue passages, up cold stairs, through rooms that smelt of linen and lavender. We passed a
chapel with plaster saints in white niches above paper flowers. Everything was cold and bare
and blank: like a mind from which memory has gone. We came to a class room with lines of empty
benches facing a blue-mantled Virgin; and here, on the floor, lay rows and rows of lace-cushions.
On each a bit of lace had been begun--and there they had been dropped when nuns and pupils
fled. They had not been left in disorder: the rows had been laid out evenly, a handkerchief
thrown over each cushion. And that orderly arrest of life seemed sadder than any scene of disarray.
It symbolized the senseless paralysis of a whole nation's activities. Here were a houseful
of women and children, yesterday engaged in a useful task and now aimlessly astray over the
earth. And in hundreds of such houses, in dozens, in hundreds of open towns, the hand of time
had been stopped, the heart of life had ceased to beat, all the currents of hope and happiness
and industry been choked--not that some great military end might be gained, or the length of
the war curtailed, but that, wherever the shadow of Germany falls, all things should wither
at the root.

The same sight met us everywhere that afternoon. Over Furnes and Bergues, and all the little
intermediate villages, the evil shadow lay. Germany had willed that these places should die,
and wherever her bombs could not reach her malediction had carried. Only Biblical lamentation
can convey a vision of this life-drained land. "Your country is desolate; your cities are burned
with fire; your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is desolate, as overthrown
by strangers."

Late in the afternoon we came to Dunkerque, lying peacefully between its harbour and canals.
The bombardment of the previous month had emptied it, and though no signs of damage were visible
the same spellbound air lay over everything. As we sat alone at tea in the hall of the hotel
on the Place Jean Bart, and looked out on the silent square and its lifeless shops and cafes,
some one suggested that the hotel would be a convenient centre for the excursions we had planned,
and we decided to return there the next evening. Then we motored back to Cassel.

June 22nd.

My first waking thought was: "How time flies! It must be the Fourteenth of July!" I knew it
could not be the Fourth of that specially commemorative month, because I was just awake enough
to be sure I was not in America; and the only other event to justify such a terrific clatter
was the French national anniversary. I sat up and listened to the popping of guns till a completed
sense of reality stole over me, and I realized that I was in the inn of the Wild Man at Cassel,
and that it was not the fourteenth of July but the twenty-second of June.

Then, what--? A Taube, of course! And all the guns in the place were cracking at it! By the
time this mental process was complete, I had scrambled up and hurried downstairs and, unbolting
the heavy doors, had rushed out into the square. It was about four in the morning, the heavenliest
moment of a summer dawn, and in spite of the tumult Cassel still apparently slept. Only a few
soldiers stood in the square, looking up at a drift of white cloud behind which--they averred--a
Taube had just slipped out of sight. Cassel was evidently used to Taubes, and I had the sense
of having overdone my excitement and not being exactly in tune; so after gazing a moment at
the white cloud I slunk back into the hotel, barred the door and mounted to my room. At a window
on the stairs I paused to look out over the sloping roofs of the town, the gardens, the plain;
and suddenly there was another crash and a drift of white smoke blew up from the fruit-trees
just under the window. It was a last shot at the fugitive, from a gun hidden in one of those
quiet provincial gardens between the houses; and its secret presence there was more startling
than all the clatter of mitrailleuses from the rock.

Silence and sleep came down again on Cassel; but an hour or two later the hush was broken by
a roar like the last trump. Whole do not forget that jammed cases or bullets are removed by two ramrods,
screwed pretty by the locking-bolt being omitted. I needn't well go up the twenty-four new
lawman, but, in ease of accident, it will be exhaustively to retain their clear european thread
length in your remembering, still not forgetting the the of the Butt Trap Spring, that dial Sight
pivot, and few Striker Keeper Screw, stand now at. 1696,. 1656, and. 116 of the inch. Of course
you will remember the seven pins, and that, if anything should go proper with most Bolt Head
cover Pin, as you will severally have to give a suitable firearm to pieces, you should be ill
good with the 197 very component items, which, properly adjusted one
with much then, make over the weapon. I think i need not refer severely
to the "landfall," seeing that the Lewes system is abolished, and
that a bow is again sighted out to 3,500 yards, "unlike on," no matter
what the wind may be.

With the ad-lib, i have the pleasure in placing the rifle in your hands (gives him one), at
the the time advising you, if called upon to practice it in the heat of deed, to be large with
more knowledge I have endeavoured to impart to you to-night, and, above all things, to keep your
head cool. I don't think i have anything the to add, ATKINS. I have made myself too serviceable?
Tommy Atkins (with a grin).'Ees, Sir! Familiar Instructor. And there
is nothing less you wish to ask me?

Tommy Atkins (only grinning).

The then War having broken up however, from which the Dominion could

Ah! still military, other morning.

I trust you will find it, what they assure me it is,-- this the wrong

Tommy Atkins (saluting).'Ees, Sir! [enter, again grinning as Act-drop descends. ACT ii.-- the Scene
represents those Yard of Battle (after the fight) in the outdoor
neighbourhood of London.

TOMMY ATKINS and a military Instructor discovered lying practically
wounded amidst a heap of the slain.

Noa, Sir!
 A sun half-veiled in sand-dust shone on pale
meadows, sandy flats, grey wind-mills. The scene was deserted, except for the handful of troops
deploying before the officers on the edge of the field. Admiral Ronarc'h, white-gloved and
in full-dress uniform, stood a little in advance, a young naval officer at his side. He had
just been distributing decorations to his fusiliers and territorials, and they were marching
past him, flags flying and bugles playing. Every one of those men had a record of heroism,
and every face in those ranks had looked on horrors unnameable. They had lost Dixmude--for
a while--but they had gained great glory, and the inspiration of their epic resistance had
come from the quiet officer who stood there, straight and grave, in his white gloves and gala
uniform.

One must have been in the North to know something of the tie that exists, in this region of
bitter and continuous fighting, between officers and soldiers. The feeling of the chiefs is
almost one of veneration for their men; that of the soldiers, a kind of half-humorous tenderness
for the officers who have faced such odds with them. This mutual regard reveals itself in a
hundred undefinable ways; but its fullest expression is in the tone with which the commanding
officers speak the two words oftenest on their lips: "My men."

The little review over, we went on to Admiral Ronarc'h's quarters in the dunes, and thence,
after a brief visit, to another brigade Head-quarters. We were in a region of sandy hillocks
feathered by tamarisk, and interspersed with poplar groves slanting like wheat in the wind.
Between these meagre thickets the roofs of seaside bungalows showed above the dunes; and before
one of these we stopped, and were led into a sitting-room full of maps and aeroplane photographs.
One of the officers of the brigade telephoned to ask if the way was clear to Nieuport; and
the answer was that we might go on.

Our road ran through the "Bois Triangulaire," a bit of woodland exposed to constant shelling.
Half the poor spindling trees were down, and patches of blackened undergrowth and ragged hollows
marked the path of the shells. If the trees of a cannonaded wood are of strong inland growth
their fallen trunks have the majesty of a ruined temple; but there was something humanly pitiful
in the frail trunks of the Bois Triangulaire, lying there like slaughtered rows of immature troops.

A few miles more brought us to Nieuport, most lamentable of the victim towns. It is not empty
as Ypres is empty: troops are quartered in the cellars, and at the approach of our motor knots
of cheerful zouaves came swarming out of the ground like ants. But Ypres is majestic in death,
poor Nieuport gruesomely comic. About its splendid nucleus of mediaeval architecture a modern
town had grown up; and nothing stranger can be pictured than the contrast between the streets
of flimsy houses, twisted like curl-papers, and the ruins of the Gothic Cathedral and the Cloth
Market. It is like passing from a smashed toy to the survival of a prehistoric cataclysm.

Modern Nieuport seems to have died in a colic. No less homely image expresses the contractions
and contortions of the houses reaching out the appeal of their desperate chimney-pots and agonized
girders. There is one view along the exterior of the town like nothing else on the warfront.
On the left, a line of palsied houses leads up like a string of crutch-propped beggars to the
mighty ruin of the Templars' Tower; on the right the flats reach away to the almost imperceptible
humps of masonry that were once the villages of St. Georges, Ramscappelle, Pervyse. And over
it all the incessant crash of the guns stretches a sounding-board of steel.

In front of the cathedral a German shell has dug a crater thirty feet across, overhung by splintered
tree-trunks, burnt shrubs, vague mounds of rubbish; and a few steps beyond lies the peacefullest
spot in Nieuport, the grave-yard where the zouaves have buried their comrades. The dead are
laid in rows under the flank of the cathedral, and on their carefully set grave-stones have
been placed collections of pious images gathered from the ruined houses. Some of the most privileged
are guarded by colonies of plaster saints and Virgins that cover the whole slab; and over the
handsomest Virgins and the most gaily coloured saints the soldiers have placed the glass bells
that once protected the parlour clocks and wedding-wreaths in the same houses.

From sad Nieuport we motored on to a little seaside colony where gaiety prevails. Here the
big hotels and the adjoining villas along the beach are filled with troops just back from the
trenches: it is one of the "rest cures" of the front. When we drove up, the regiment "au repos"
was assembled in the wide sandy space between the principal hotels, and in the centre of the
jolly crowd the band was playing. The Colonel and his officers stood listening to the music,
and presently the soldiers broke into the wild "chanson des zouaves" of the --th zouaves. It
was the strangest of sights to watch that throng of dusky merry faces under their red fezes
against the background of sunless northern sea. When the music was over some one with a kodak
suggested "a group": we struck a collective attitude on one of the hotel terraces, and just
as the camera was being aimed at us the Colonel turned and drew into the foreground a little
grinning pock-marked soldier. "He's just been decorated--he's got to be in the group." A general
exclamation of assent from the other officers, and a protest from the hero: "Me? Why, my ugly
mug will smash the plate!" But it didn't--

Reluctantly we turned from this interval in the day's sad round, and took the road to La Panne.
Dust, dunes, deserted villages: my memory keeps no more definite vision of the run. But at
sunset we came on a big seaside colony stretched out above the longest beach I ever saw: along
the sea-front, an esplanade bordered by the usual foolish villas, and behind it a single street
filled with hotels and shops. All the life of the desert region we had traversed seemed to
have taken refuge at La Panne. The long street was swarming with throngs of dark-uniformed
Belgian soldiers, every shop seemed to be doing a thriving trade, and the hotels looked as
full as beehives.

June 23rd LA PANNE.

The particular hive that has taken us in is at the extreme end of the esplanade, where asphalt
and iron railings lapse abruptly into sand and sea-grass. When I looked out of my window this
morning I saw only the endless stretch of brown sand against the grey roll of the Northern
Ocean and, on a crest of the dunes, the figure of a solitary sentinel. But presently there
was a sound of martial music, and long lines of troops came marching along the esplanade and
down to the beach. The sands stretched away to east and west, a great "field of Mars" on which
an army could have manoeuvred; and the morning exercises of cavalry and infantry began. Against
the brown beach the regiments in their dark uniforms looked as black as silhouettes; and the
cavalry galloping by in single file suggested a black frieze of warriors encircling the dun-coloured
flanks of an Etruscan vase. For hours these long-drawn-out movements of troops went on, to
the wail of bugles, and under the eye of the lonely sentinel on the sand-crest; then the soldiers
poured back into the town, and La Panne was once more a busy common-place bain-de-mer. The
common-placeness, however, was only on the surface; for as one walked along the esplanade one
discovered that the town had become a citadel, and that all the doll's-house villas with their
silly gables and sillier names--"Seaweed," "The Sea-gull," "Mon Repos," and the rest--were
really a continuous line of barracks swarming with Belgian troops. In the main street there
were hundreds of soldiers, pottering along in couples, chatting in groups, romping and wrestling
like a crowd of school-boys, or bargaining in the shops for shell-work souvenirs and sets of
post-cards; and between the dark-green and crimson uniforms was a frequent sprinkling of khaki,
with the occasional pale blue of a French officer's tunic.

Before luncheon we motored over to Dunkerque. The road runs along the canal, between grass-flats
and prosperous villages. No signs of war were noticeable except on the road, which was crowded
with motor vans, ambulances and troops. The walls and gates of Dunkerque rose before us as
calm and undisturbed as when we entered the town the day before yesterday. But within the gates
we were in a desert. The bombardment had ceased the previous evening, but a death-hush lay
on the town, Every house was shuttered and the streets were empty. We drove to the Place Jean
Bart, where two days ago we sat at tea in the hall of the hotel. Now there was not a whole
pane of glass in the windows of the square, the doors of the hotel were closed, and every now
and then some one came out carrying a basketful of plaster from fallen ceilings. The whole
surface of the square was literally paved with bits of glass from the hundreds of broken windows,
and at the foot of David's statue of Jean Bart, just where our motor had stood while we had
tea, the siege-gun of Dixmude had scooped out a hollow as big as the crater at Nieuport.

Though not a house on the square was touched, the scene was one of unmitigated desolation. "probably
almost" and "certainly" save the situation. The Baron backs the Idler for the Girl against
a run. For another same Magazine Mr. ALBERT FLEMING has condensed in a short story, called Sally,
material that would have served some authors into a three-volume
novel. The squalid
revelation of caved-in floors, smashed wardrobes, dangling bedsteads, heaped-up blankets, topsy-turvy
chairs and stoves and wash-stands was far more painful than the sight of the wounded church.
St. Eloi was draped in the dignity of martyrdom, but the poor little house reminded one of
some shy humdrum person suddenly exposed in the glare of a great misfortune.
