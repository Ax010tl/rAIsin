tongue and a nice derangement of epitaphs."  It was absurd to have one's English criticized
by any Irishman.  It is said that "it's a pity when lovely women talk of things that they don't
understand"; but I am afraid that men are equally given to the same vice.  I have heard men
give the most confident opinions upon subjects which they don't in the least understand, which
nobody expects them to understand, nor have they had any opportunity for acquiring the requisite
knowledge. I was surprised observations about one'seat i said the spin i learned something to orrid,

  It is nature who warbles
softly in the love notes of the bird, and who elevates the soul by the roar of the cataract
and the pealing of the thunder.  To her the musician and the poet listen, and imitate the great
teacher.  It is nature who, in the structure of the leaf or in the avenue of the lofty limes,
teaches the architect how to adorn his designs with the most graceful of embellishments, to
rear the lofty column or display the lengthening vista of the cathedral aisle.  It is nature
who is teaching us all to be tender, loving, and true, and to love and worship God, and to
admire all His works.  Let us then in our criticism refer everything first of all to nature.
Is the work natural?  Does it follow nature?  Secondly, does it follow the rules of art?  If
it passes the first test, it is well worth the courteous attention of the critic.  If it passes
both tests, it is perfect.  But if only the second test is passed, it may please a few pedants,
but it is worthless, and cannot live.

6.  Criticisms should be bona fide.

You will be rather alarmed at a lawyer beginning this topic, and will expect to hear pages
of "Starkie on Libel," or to have all the perorations of Erskine's speeches recited to you.
For one terrible moment I feel I have you in my power; but I scorn to take advantage of the
position.  I don't mean to talk about libel at all, or, at least, not more than I can help.
I have been endeavouring to show what good criticism should be like.  If criticism is so base
that there is a question to be left to a jury as to what damages ought to be paid for the speaking
or writing of it, one may say at once that it is unworthy of the name of criticism at all.
Slander is not criticism.  But there is a great deal of criticism which may be called not bona
fide, which is yet not malicious.  It is biassed perhaps, even from some charitable motive,
perhaps from some sordid motive, perhaps from indolence, from a desire to be thought learned
or clever, or what not--in fact, from one or other of those thousand things which prevent persons
from speaking fairly and straightforwardly.  When you take up the Athenaeum or the Spectator,
and read from those very able reviews an account of the last new novel, do you think the writer
has written simply what he truly thinks and feels about the matter?  No! he has been told he
has been dull of late.  He feels he must write a spicy review.  He has a cold in his head,
he is savage accordingly.  A friend of his tells him he knows the author, or he recognizes
the name of a college friend--he will be lenient.  The book is on a subject which he meant
to take up himself; and, without knowing it, he is jealous.  I need not multiply further these
suggestions which will occur to anyone.  We all remember the dinner in Paternoster Row given
by Mrs. Bungay, the publisher's wife.  We all remember the delight of Mrs. Bungay when the
Hon. Percy Popjoy drives up in a private hansom with an enormous grey cab horse and a tiger
behind, and Mrs. Bacon is looking out grimly from the window on the opposite side of the street.

There was a trial in London in December, 1878, which illustrates the subject I am upon.  It
was an action for libel by the well-known artist, Mr. Whistler, against Mr. Ruskin, the most
distinguished art critic of the age.  The passage in the writing of Mr. Ruskin, of which Mr.
Whistler complained, contains, I think, almost every fault which, according to my divisions,
a criticism can contain.  The passage is as follows:--"For Mr. Whistler's own sake no less
than for the protection of the purchaser, Sir Coutts Lindsey ought not to have admitted works
into the gallery in which the ill-educated conceit of the artist so nearly approached the aspect
of wilful imposture.  I have seen and heard much of cockney impudence before now, but never
expected to hear a coxcomb ask 200 guineas for flinging a pot of paint in the public's face."

The Attorney-General of the day, as counsel for Mr. Ruskin, said that this was a severe and
slashing criticism, but perfectly fair and bona fide.

Now, let us see. That may be severe and slashing, but is it fair?  If there was a wilful imposition,
why not say so; but, of course, there was not, and could not be; but it is most unfair to insinuate
that there nearly was.  The truth is, the words "wilful imposture" are a gross exaggeration.
The jury, after retiring, came into court and asked the judge what was the meaning of wilful
imposture, and, being told that it meant nothing in particular, they returned a verdict of
damages one farthing, which meant to say that they thought equally little of Whistler's picture
and of Ruskin's criticism.  Next we come to "Cockney impudence" and "coxcomb."  Surely these
terms must be grossly inappropriate to the subject in hand, which is Whistler's painting, and
not his personal qualities.  Next, it seems that Mr. Ruskin thinks it is an offence to ask
200 guineas for a picture, but where the offence lies we are not told.  It might be folly to
give 200 guineas for one of Whistler's pictures, but why should he be abused for asking it?
The insinuation is that it is a false pretence, and such an insinuation is not bona fide. 
Lastly, we are told that Mr. Whistler has been flinging a pot of paint in the public's face.
In the first place, this is vulgar.  In the next place, it is absurd.  When Sydney Smith said
that someone's writing was like a spider having escaped from the inkstand and wandered over
the paper, it was an exaggerated criticism, but it was appropriate.  But if Mr. Whistler flung
a pot of paint anywhere, it was upon his own canvas, and not into the face of the public. 
Now, let anybody think what is the effect of such criticism.  Is one enabled by the light of
it to see the merits or faults of Whistler's painting?  And yet this was written by the greatest
art critic in this country, by the man who has done more to reveal the secrets of Nature and
of Art to us all than any man living, and, I had almost said, than any living or dead.  But
passion and arrogance are not criticism; and, in the sense in which I have used the term, such
criticism is not bona fide. Well may Mr. Matthew Arnold say, speaking of Mr. Ruskin's criticism
upon another subject, that he forgets all moderation and proportion, and loses the balance
of his mind.  This, he says, "is to show in one's criticism to the highest excess the note
of provinciality."

There was, once upon a time, a very strong Court of Appeal.  It was universally acknowledged
to be so, and the memory of it still remains, and very old lawyers still love to recall its
glories.  It was composed of Lord Chancellor Campbell and the Lords Justices Knight-Bruce and
Turner.  Bethell (afterwards Lord Westbury) was an ambitious and aspiring man, and was always
most caustic in his criticisms.  He had been arguing before the above Court one day, and upon
his turning round after finishing his argument, some counsel in the row behind him asked, "Well,
Bethell, how will their judgment go?"  Bethell replied, in his softest but most cutting tones,
"I do not know.  Knight-Bruce is a jack-pudding. Turner is an old woman.  And no human being
can by any possibility predict what will fall from the lips of that inexpressibly fatuous individual
who sits in the middle."  This is funny, but it is vulgar, and it is not given in good faith.
It is the offspring of anger and spite mixed with a desire to be clever and antithetical.
