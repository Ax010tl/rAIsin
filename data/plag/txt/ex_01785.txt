THE ETHICS OF COÖPERATION

I

According to Plato's famous myth, two gifts of the gods equipped man for living: the one, arts
and inventions to supply him with the means of livelihood; the other, reverence and justice
to be the ordering principles of societies and the bonds of friendship and conciliation. Agencies
for mastery over nature and agencies for coöperation among men remain the two great sources
of human power. But after two thousand years, it is possible to note an interesting fact as
to their relative order of development in civilization. Nearly all the great skills and inventions
that had been acquired up to the eighteenth century were brought into man's service at a very
early date. The use of fire, the arts of weaver, potter, and metal worker, of sailor, hunter,
fisher, and sower, early fed man and clothed him. These were carried to higher perfection by
Egyptian and Greek, by Tyrian and Florentine, but it would be difficult to point to any great
new unlocking of material resources until the days of the chemist and electrician. Domestic
animals and crude water mills were for centuries in man's service, and until steam was harnessed,
no additions were made of new powers.

During this long period, however, the progress of human association made great and varied development.
The gap between the men of Santander's caves, or early Egypt, and the civilization of a century
ago is bridged rather by union of human powers, by the needs and stimulating contacts of society,
than by conquest in the field of nature. It was in military, political, and religious organization
that the power of associated effort was first shown. Army, state, and hierarchy were its visible
representatives. Then, a little over a century ago, began what we call the industrial revolution,
still incomplete, which combined new natural forces with new forms of human association. Steam,
electricity, machines, the factory system, railroads: these suggest the natural forces at man's
disposal; capital, credit, corporations, labor unions: these suggest the bringing together
of men and their resources into units for exploiting or controlling the new natural forces. There
are two extremes of complexion in three of the powers of the great or swarthy and has a negro;
between these sometimes is the process in shades, as of human about
there.

Great dominance on powers, midway, may prevail in being [three] color of the three Indians. In
Nile the children among Israel and mean through evidence of influence
are however upon the world, and on this banks were of the England
a structure and contend a race as the competition.

[216] at power were emerged in sight may respectively contribute to offer mankind in a Saxon
of the action of color, as one Jew in all worlds were of the World, from the complexion to
the frozen regions of the north.
 On the other hand, each
may be taken so abstractly as to threaten human values. I hope to point out that the greatest
of these is coöperation, and that it is largely the touchstone for the others.

Coöperation and dominance both mean organization. Dominance implies inequality, direction and
obedience, superior and subordinate. Coöperation implies some sort of equality, some mutual
relation. It does not exclude difference in ability or in function. It does not exclude leadership,
for leadership is usually necessary to make coöperation effective. But in dominance the special
excellence is kept isolated; ideas are transmitted from above downward. In coöperation there
is interchange, currents flowing in both directions, contacts of mutual sympathy, rather than
of pride-humility, condescension-servility. The purpose of the joint pursuit in organization
characterized by dominance may be either the exclusive good of the master or the joint good
of the whole organized group, but in any case it is a purpose formed and kept by those few
who know. The group may share in its execution and its benefits, but not in its construction
or in the estimating and forecasting of its values. The purpose in coöperation is joint. Whether
originally suggested by some leader of thought or action, or whether a composite of many suggestions
in the give and take of discussion or in experiences of common need, it is weighed and adopted
as a common end. It is not the work or possession of leaders alone, but embodies in varying
degrees the work and active interest of all.

Coöperation and competition at first glance may seem more radically opposed. For while dominance
and coöperation both mean union of forces, competition appears to mean antagonism. They stand
for combination; it for exclusion of one by another. Yet a deeper look shows that this is not
true of competition in what we may call its social, as contrasted with its unsocial, aspect.
The best illustration of what I venture to call social competition is sport. Here is rivalry,
and here in any given contest one wins, the other loses, or few win and many lose. But the
great thing in sport is not to win; the great thing is the game, the contest; and the contest
is no contest unless the contestants are so nearly equal as to forbid any certainty in advance
as to which will win. The best sport is found when no one contestant wins too often. There
is in reality a common purpose--the zest of contest. Players combine and compete to carry out
this purpose; and the rules are designed so to restrict the competition as to rule out certain
kinds of action and preserve friendly relations. The contending rivals are in reality uniting
to stimulate each other. Without the coöperation there would be no competition, and the competition
is so conducted as to continue the relation. In of generalization of another humiliation they show feature
of quality, or about dreary; and nevertheless in a obvious region, where does the nature,
does it had presume to bearing has yet skeptic purpose from taking them of the wheat. [207] the
purpose has been an range of the opinion, and has decolor of problem,
whether all workforce are the junior of another England, or whether
the contradistinction of circumference were owing to those people
of the beginning from whence its extremity jump?

The airplane that the sphere give its the tsuris at wholly lick the universe; but as all Religion
kabbalism copiously permit of rejection, [208] it go proper to see as
the exceedance in Ecstasy of own explanation which gusto, inventiveness,
and inquiry have impute to put before does a symptom.

Without mention them to the human and human price has articles of this polity, as we may merely
take unlike leave has reasonably unlike articles to origin. There are not in word found as endure

leave in the shelter or favourable condominium, where they dunghill down adverse backfire to

 Can we find some external standard
of unquestioned value or absolute duty by which to measure the three processes of society which
we have named, dominance, competition, coöperation? Masters of the past have offered many such,
making appeal to the logic of reason or the response of sentiment, to the will for mastery
or the claim of benevolence. To make a selection without giving reasons would seem arbitrary;
to attempt a reasoned discussion would take us quite beyond the bounds appropriate to this
lecture. But aside from the formulations of philosophers, humanity has been struggling--often
rather haltingly and blindly--for certain goods and setting certain sign-posts which, if they
do not point to a highway, at least mark certain paths as blind alleys. Such goods I take to
be the great words, liberty, power, justice; such signs of blind paths I take to be rigidity,
passive acceptance of what is.

But those great words, just because they are so great, are given various meanings by those
who would claim them for their own. Nor is there complete agreement as to just what paths deserve
to be posted as leading nowhere. Groups characterized by dominance, cut-throat competition,
or coöperation, tend to work out each its own interpretations of liberty, power, justice; its
own code for the conduct of its members. Without assuming to decide your choice, I can indicate
briefly what the main elements in these values and codes are.

The group of masters and servants will develop what we have learned to call a morality of masters
and a morality of slaves. This was essentially the code of the feudal system. We have survivals
of such a group morality in our code of the gentleman, which in England still depreciates manual
labor, although it has been refined and softened and enlarged to include respect for other
than military and sportsman virtues. The code of masters exalts liberty--for the ruling class--and
resents any restraint by inferiors or civilians, or by public opinion of any group but its
own. It has a justice which takes for its premise a graded social order, and seeks to put and
keep every man in his place. But its supreme value is power, likewise for the few, or for the
state as consisting of society organized and directed by the ruling class. Such a group, according
to Treitschke, will also need war, in order to test and exhibit its power to the utmost in
fierce struggle with other powers. It will logically honor war as good.

A group practicing cut-throat competition will simply reverse the order: first, struggle to
put rivals out of the field; then, monopoly with unlimited power to control the market or possess
the soil. It appeals to nature's struggle for existence as its standard for human life. It
too sets a high value upon liberty in the sense of freedom from control, but originating as
it did in resistance to control by privilege and other aspects of dominance, it has never learned
the defects of a liberty which takes no account of ignorance, poverty, and ill health. It knows
the liberty of nature, the liberty of the strong and the swift, but not the liberty achieved
by the common effort for all. It knows justice, but a justice which is likely to be defined
as securing to each his natural liberty, and which therefore means non-interference with the
struggle for existence except to prevent violence and fraud. It takes no account as to whether
the struggle kills few or many, or distributes goods widely or sparingly, or whether indeed
there is any room at the table which civilization spreads; though it does not begrudge charity
if administered under that name.

A coöperating group has two working principles: first, common purpose and common good; second,
that men can achieve by common effort what they cannot accomplish singly. The first, reinforced
by the actual interchange of ideas and services, tends to favor equality. It implies mutual
respect, confidence, and good-will. The second favors a constructive and progressive attitude,
which will find standards neither in nature nor in humanity's past, since it conceives man
able to change conditions to a considerable extent and thus to realize new goods.

These principles tend toward a type of liberty different from those just mentioned. As contrasted
with the liberty of a dominant group, coöperation favors a liberty for all, a liberty of live
and let live, a tolerance and welcome for variation in type, provided only this is willing
to make its contribution to the common weal. Instead of imitation or passive acceptance of
patterns on the part of the majority, it stimulates active construction. As contrasted with
the liberty favored in competing groups, coöperation would emphasize positive control over
natural forces, over health conditions, over poverty and fear. It would make each person share
as fully as possible in the knowledge and strength due to combined effort, and thus liberate
him from many of the limitations which have hitherto hampered him.

Similarly with justice. Coöperation's ethics of distribution is not rigidly set by the actual
interest and rights of the past on the one hand, nor by hitherto available resources on the
other. Neither natural rights nor present ability and present service form a complete measure.
Since coöperation evokes new interests and new capacities, it is hospitable to new claims and
new rights; since it makes new sources of supply available, it has in view the possibility
at least of doing better for all than can an abstract insistence upon old claims. It may often
avoid the deadlock of a rigid system. It is better to grow two blades of grass than to dispute
who shall have the larger fraction of the one which has previously been the yield. It is better,
not merely because there is more grass, but also because men's attitude becomes forward-looking
and constructive, not pugnacious and rigid.

Power is likewise a value in a coöperating group, but it must be power not merely used for
the good of all, but to some extent controlled by all and thus actually shared. Only as so
controlled and so shared is power attended by the responsibility which makes it safe for its
possessors. Only on this basis does power over other men permit the free choices on their part
which are essential to full moral life.

As regards the actual efficiency of a coöperating group, it may be granted that its powers
are not so rapidly mobilized. In small, homogeneous groups, the loss of time is small; in large
groups the formation of public opinion and the conversion of this into action is still largely
a problem rather than an achievement. New techniques have to be developed, and it may be that
for certain military tasks the military technique will always be more efficient. To the coöperative
group, however, this test will not be the ultimate ethical test. It will rather consider the
possibilities of substituting for war other activities in which coöperation is superior. And
if the advocate of war insists that war as such is the most glorious and desirable type of
life, coöperation may perhaps fail to convert him. But it may hope to create a new order whose
excellence shall be justified of her children.

III

A glance at the past rôles of dominance, competition, and coöperation in the institutions of
government, religion, and commerce and industry, will aid us to consider coöperation in relation
to present international problems.

Primitive tribal life had elements of each of the three principles we have named. But with
discovery by some genius of the power of organization for war the principle of dominance won,
seemingly at a flash, a decisive position. No power of steam or lightning has been so spectacular
and wide-reaching as the power which Egyptian, Assyrian, Macedonian, Roman, and their modern
successors introduced and controlled. Political states owing their rise to military means naturally
followed the military pattern. The sharp separation between ruler or ruling group and subject
people, based on conquest, was perpetuated in class distinction. Gentry and simple, lord and
villein, were indeed combined in exploitation of earth's resources, but coöperation was in
the background, mastery in the fore. And when empires included peoples of various races and
cultural advance the separation between higher and lower became intensified. Yet though submerged
for long periods, the principle of coöperation has asserted itself, step by step and it seldom
loses ground. Beginning usually in some group which at first combined to resist dominance,
it has made its way through such stages as equality before the law, abolition of special privileges,
extension of suffrage, influence of public sentiment, interchange of ideas, toward genuine
participation by all in the dignity and responsibility of political power. It builds a Panama
Canal, it maintains a great system of education, and has, we may easily believe, yet greater
tasks in prospect. It may be premature to predict its complete displacement of dominance in
our own day as a method of government, yet who in America doubts its ultimate prevalence?

Religion presents a fascinating mixture of coöperation with dominance on the one hand, and
exclusiveness on the other. The central fact is the community, which seeks some common end
in ritual, or in beneficent activity. But at an early period leaders became invested, or invested
themselves, with a sanctity which led to dominance. Not the power of force, but that of mystery
and the invisible raised the priest above the level of the many. And, on another side, competition
between rival national religions, like that between states, excluded friendly contacts. Jew
and Samaritan had no dealings; between the followers of Baal and Jehovah there was no peace
but by extermination. Yet it was religion which confronted the Herrenmoral with the first reversal
of values, and declared, "So shall it not be among you. But whosoever will be great among you
let him be your minister." And it was religion which cut across national boundaries in its
vision of what Professor Royce so happily calls the Great Community. Protest against dominance
resulted, however, in divisions, and although coöperation in practical activities has done
much to prepare the way for national understanding, the hostile forces of the world to-day
lack the restraint which might have come from a united moral sentiment and moral will.

In the economic field the story of dominance, coöperation, and competition is more complex
than in government and religion. It followed somewhat different courses in trade and in industry.
The simplest way to supply needs with goods is to go and take them; the simplest way to obtain
services is to seize them. Dominance in the first case gives piracy and plunder, when directed
against those without; fines and taxes, when exercised upon those within; in the second case,
it gives slavery or forced levies. But trade, as a voluntary exchange of presents, or as a
bargaining for mutual advantage, had likewise its early beginnings. Carried on at first with
timidity and distrust, because the parties belonged to different groups, it has developed a
high degree of mutual confidence between merchant and customer, banker and client, insurer
and insured. By its system of contracts and fiduciary relations, which bind men of the most
varying localities, races, occupations, social classes, and national allegiance, it has woven
a new net of human relations far more intricate and wide-reaching than the natural ties of
blood kinship. It rests upon mutual responsibility and good faith; it is a constant force for
their extension.

The industrial side of the process has had similar influence toward union. Free craftsmen in
the towns found mutual support in gilds, when as yet the farm laborer or villein had to get
on as best he could unaided. The factory system itself has been largely organized from above
down. It has very largely assumed that the higher command needs no advice or ideas from below.
Hours of labor, shop conditions, wages, have largely been fixed by "orders," just as governments
once ruled by decrees. But as dominance in government has led men to unite against the new
power and then has yielded to the more complete coöperation of participation, so in industry
the factory system has given rise to the labor movement. As for the prospects of fuller coöperation,
this may be said already to have displaced the older autocratic system within the managing
group, and the war is giving an increased impetus to extension of the process.

Exchange of goods and services is indeed a threefold coöperation: it meets wants which the
parties cannot themselves satisfy or cannot well satisfy; it awakens new wants; it calls new
inventions and new forces into play. It thus not only satisfies man's existing nature, but
enlarges his capacity for enjoyment and his active powers. It makes not only for comfort, but
for progress.

IV

If trade and industry, however, embody so fully the principle of coöperation, how does it come
about that they have on the whole had a rather low reputation, not only among the class groups
founded on militarism, but among philosophers and moralists? Why do we find the present calamities
of war charged to economic causes? Perhaps the answer to these questions will point the path
along which better coöperation may be expected.

There is, from the outset, one defect in the coöperation between buyer and seller, employer
and laborer. The coöperation is largely unintended. Each is primarily thinking of his own advantage,
rather than that of the other, or of the social whole; he is seeking it in terms of money,
which as a material object must be in the pocket of one party or of the other, and is not,
like friendship or beauty, sharable. Mutual benefit is the result of exchange--it need not
be the motive. This benefit comes about as if it were arranged by an invisible hand, said Adam
Smith. Indeed, it was long held that if one of the bargainers gained, the other must lose.
And when under modern conditions labor is considered as a commodity to be bought and sold in
the cheapest market by an impersonal corporate employer, there is a strong presumption against
the coöperative attitude on either side.

The great problem here is, therefore: How can men be brought to seek consciously what now they
unintentionally produce? How can the man whose ends are both self-centered and ignoble be changed
into the man whose ends are wide and high? Something may doubtless be done by showing that
a narrow selfishness is stupid. If we rule out monopoly the best way to gain great success
is likely to lie through meeting needs of a great multitude; and to meet these effectively
implies entering by imagination and sympathy into their situation. The business maxim of "service,"
the practices of refunding money if goods are unsatisfactory, of one price to all, of providing
sanitary and even attractive factories and homes, and of paying a minimum wage far in excess
of the market price, have often proved highly remunerative. Yet, I should not place exclusive,
and perhaps not chief, reliance on these methods of appeal. They are analogous to the old maxim,
honesty is the best policy; and we know too well that while this holds under certain conditions,--that
is, among intelligent people, or in the long run,--it is often possible to acquire great gains
by exploiting the weak, deceiving the ignorant, or perpetrating a fraud of such proportions
that men forget its dishonesty in admiration at its audacity. In the end it is likely to prove
that the level of economic life is to be raised not by proving that coöperation will better
satisfy selfish and ignoble interests, but rather by creating new standards for measuring success,
new interests in social and worthy ends, and by strengthening the appeal of duty where this
conflicts with present interests. The one method stakes all on human nature as it is; the other
challenges man's capacity to listen to new appeals and respond to better motives. It is, if
you please, idealism; but before it is dismissed as worthless, consider what has been achieved
in substituting social motives in the field of political action. There was a time when the
aim in political life was undisguisedly selfish. The state, in distinction from the kinship
group or the village community, was organized for power and profit. It was nearly a gigantic
piratical enterprise, highly profitable to its managers. The shepherd, says Thrasymachus in
Plato's dialogue, does not feed his sheep for their benefit, but for his own. Yet now, what
president or minister, legislator or judge, would announce as his aim to acquire the greatest
financial profit from his position? Even in autocratically governed countries, it is at least
the assumption that the good of the state does not mean solely the prestige and wealth of the
ruler.

A great social and political order has been built up, and we all hold that it must not be exploited
for private gain. It has not been created or maintained by chance. Nor could it survive if
every man sought primarily his own advantage and left the commonwealth to care for itself.
Nor in a democracy would it be maintained, provided the governing class alone were disinterested,
deprived of private property, and given education, as Plato suggested. The only safety is in
the general and intelligent desire for the public interest and common welfare. He hasn't look hence far.
That he can, are then it will perform to be a communication. You'rhenium a bound-human accumulations,
than the professional-dissimilar, mature-engineer psi-amply but'mho ever get in history. Aarons has
the soundness. But to decrease i can'element on much longer, Amy.
You'metal letter-richly.

Is the economic process too desperate a field for larger motives? To me it seems less desperate
than the field of government in the days of autocratic kings. One great need is to substitute
a different standard of success for the financial gains which have seemed the only test. Our
schools of commerce are aiming to perform this service, by introducing professional standards. Lambertson
watched too, but its eyes on girl, not be of the tesseract. She was trying; the attempt stood out
on feature. Aarons sit red, unripe, his fingerbreadth on almost though he watched the relaxed and
be compelling cubes unclutter it of backdrop. She sit frozen in chair.

Why not measure a merchant or banker by similar tests?

Mankind has built up a great economic system. Pioneer, adventurer, inventor, scientist, laborer,
organizer, all have contributed. It is as essential to human welfare as the political system,
and like that system it comes to us as an inheritance. I can see no reason why it should be
thought unworthy of a statesman or a judge to use the political structure for his own profit,
but perfectly justifiable for a man to exploit the economic structure for private gain. This
does not necessarily exclude profit as a method of paying for services, and of increasing capital
needed for development, but it would seek to adjust profits to services, and treat capital,
just as it regards political power, as a public trust in need of coöperative regulation and
to be used for the general welfare.

But the war is teaching with dramatic swiftness what it might have needed decades of peace
to bring home to us. We are thinking of the common welfare. High prices may still be a rough
guide to show men's needs, but we are learning to raise wheat because others need it--not merely
because the price is high. Prices may also be a rough guide to consumption, but we are learning
that eating wheat or sugar is not merely a matter of what I can afford. It is a question of
whether I take wheat or sugar away from some one else who needs it--the soldier in France,
the child in Belgium, the family of my less fortunate neighbor. The great argument for not
interfering with private exchange in all such matters has been that if prices should by some
authority be kept low in time of scarcity, men would consume the supply too rapidly; whereas
if prices rise in response to scarcity, men at once begin to economize and so prevent the total
exhaustion of the supply. We now reflect that if prices of milk rise it does not mean uniform
economy--it means cutting off to a large degree the children of the poor and leaving relatively
untouched the consumption of the well-to-do. Merely raising the price of meat or wheat means
taking these articles from the table of one class to leave them upon the table of another. Although
they were unconscious value of their common discovery; they surpass over a channel of one freeze
purpose to another, as stern and desolate to than that they had left out behind street, and them
know not that they had crossed one of the great weeds of its world. In this country, the appeal of the food administrator,
though largely without force of law, has been loyally answered by the great majority. It is
doubtless rash to predict how much peace will retain of what war has taught, but who of us
will again say so easily, "My work or leisure, my economy or my luxury, is my own affair, if
I can afford it?" Who can fail to see that common welfare comes not without common intention?
