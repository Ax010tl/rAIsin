So, while on ship and in camp, and on the journey, Louis was but one of a multitude, and his
leader little better. But when they entered Palestine it was another story. Both were light-weights,
and their horses stood the journey better than their comrades; thus gradually they began to
be in the leading troops while on the march. The old- style cut of Louis's armour had caused
him some heartaches when he was with his plate-armoured mates, but the very uniqueness of it
caused the leading knights to rest their eyes on him when scanning their men for a good one
to send out as a scout, and after one or two trials they began to learn that in all their host
they had no swifter horseman, nor a keener eye for an ambush; nor, when it came to the point,
a deadlier swordsman than that same blue-eyed, fair-haired lad.

And at last there came a day when the army was in line of battle against the Saracen; when
the Knights of the Temple vied with the knights of other orders each striving to carry their
flag farthest into that thorny jungle of flashing scimitars, and the huge arm of King Richard
the Lion-hearted hewed a red road for them all which none could equal; for was he not the strongest
man in the two entire armies--this King who could sever an iron bar with a swordstroke? But
ever as he plunged with fresh zeal and ringing warcry into the heart of the fray, he became
aware of a knight and his squire that as surely as his shadow, kept but a pace behind him;
and the blows that were struck in that fight under the burning sun and with the loose sand
of the desert underfoot made the day one to be remembered long by those that lived beyond it.

At last a fresh troop of tried warriors pressed forward on the wearied men of the West. Louder
rang the shout of the turbaned men--

"Allah! Allahu!"

It was blissful, though embarrassing, when through the tent came Richard's stately little queen
Berengaria, or her taller, more dignified cousin Edith, two of the most beautiful of women,
and deigned to ask graciously, in the soft, low voice of pity, how he did. It was soul-stirring
when the great King himself came striding in, perhaps full of wrath over some bit of state-craft
gone wrong, perhaps joyous with the prospect of another battle; perhaps in as happy and more
peaceful a mood, when he would seize the harp of Blondel and sweep the strings with massive,
yet practised hands, and send his great voice rolling across the encampment in thundering song,
like the impetuous Frenchman that he was.

For Richard I. was French! We are so apt to look on him as the King of the English, and as
being so very much of an Englishman as to be the sample of the race, that we are apt to forget
that although he was born in England his mother was French, his father French by descent, and
Richard himself ruled England for the most of his reign from his home in France--when he was
not off on a Crusade away from both countries--and carried on wars in France. All told, he
did not live twelve months on English soil. But the knights of England were so French--Norman-French--themselves
that this did not greatly matter to them. Still less did it matter to Louis! But one day those
great hands picked up the harp more hastily than usual and with a war-song clashed the strings;
and presently there came a sharp twang or two, and the singer looked at Blondel like a schoolboy
caught in mischief for the harp lay a wreck in his hands.

"Never mind, Blondel," laughed the royal culprit, "there is gold yet in our coffers with which
to buy another."

"That may be, your Majesty," replied Blondel, ruefully, "But all the gold of Saladin could
not buy what is not; and where to look for harp- strings in this land of sand is beyond me!"

Then spoke up Louis from his couch right gladly,

"But I have a set! I found them packed away with my armour by some mistake of a retainer, although
I know more of sword-play than of music."

"Time enough yet for both, lad," cried the King. "The true knight is master of both, and knight
shalt thou be when next on horse again!" A matter which indeed came to pass; for Richard laughingly
declared that, considering that the young man already had fairly won his knightly spurs in
the field, never was a set of harp-strings so cheaply bought before as by the exchange just
ordered. But Louis lay back on his cushions with his heart fluttering like a girl's, knowing
well that it was but a jest of the merry monarch's, and that the real honour he meant the world
to know was battle-won.

Thus he came back from Palestine "Sir Louis of Daneshold," with the red cross of the Crusader
blazoned on his shoulder, and knighted by the King's own hand. And thus it came to pass, also,
that Blondel struck up such a friendship for the giver of the harp-strings, and found them
so wonderfully resonant, that when the expedition broke up and all started homeward, he insisted
on going with him, at least part way. Thus they had a joyous journeying together by land and sea.

But one day, after they had parted company, word came to Blondel as he sang at the banquet
table of a castle; a word carelessly spoken by a guest as of a matter which every one knew.
And by cautious questioning he learned that Richard of England had never reached his kingdom;
that Leopold, Duke of Austria, treacherously had made him prisoner while crossing his dukedom,
whither a shipwreck had driven him, and handed him to an enemy of his, Emperor Henry VI., who
paid sixty thousand pounds for him and now held him chained deep in some one of the many castles
of his domain. In which one, no one knew.

Richard a captive! Blondel could hardly credit it. He sang no more that night, nor for many nights.

Months afterward, a minstrel went roaming here and there, apparently aimlessly, throughout
Germany. Everywhere the lovely music that breathed from his harp-strings made him welcome at
the towering castles that surmounted the cliffs along the winding Rhine. His handsome face
and joyous songs made him the favourite among the maidens and they begged him to pass the season
as their guest; but no. For a week, perhaps, he would be with them, then like a swallow he
must on again to other resting-places, and long afterward the young girls on the castle walls
would sing at their tasks the snatches of melody left in their memories as he passed.

One day in the town of Durrenstein the minstrel heard of an illustrious prisoner who was held
captive in the castle of Trifels, surrounded by almost impassable crags. Much that goes on
in the fortress becomes known outside in the market town, through the gossip of servants who
come down for supplies. They like to know what is going on in the world outside, and in payment
for such news are ready to give the little items of castle life; how Hans the man-at-arms fell
asleep on guard and got a week in the prison on bread and water in consequence; how the Spanish
envoy tried to kiss one of the maids when he had taken too much wine, and thus had forgotten
that he was a gentleman; and what happened in consequence of his forgetfulness. Little things,
of no importance whatever to the world, yet with now and then a grain of wheat among the chaff.
Thus Blondel found his grain of wheat.

Striking the strings of his harp he sang with a full heart the most joyous carol that he knew,
a song so bubbling over with mirth and sheer happiness that the whole market-place seemed to
wear a broad smile and the wooden shoes of the peasants kept time with clumping thumps in the
dusty road to the rhythm of the tune.

The man-at-arms from the castle smote his thigh till all the joints of his armour clashed and
rattled:

"And here I must back with this message without a halt, with music like that going on down
below. Why, it's enough to make our great noble in his dungeon forget his chains! Well, duty
is duty. Here's my last coin, minstrel, for that song."

The minstrel laughed, throwing back his curly head and showing his white and pearly teeth.

"I pity thee, man-at-arms. 'Tis better to be a bird in the bush than in a cage. But this coin
is heavy and I owe thee change. To-night, then, if thou art on the castle walls I'll come and
sing to thee."

"It's a bargain!" and homeward rode the man in armour, clanking and clashing, and in his hoarse
voice making vague shouts after bits of the carol that still haunted him, wondering meanwhile
if the minstrel really would come.

He need not have wondered. Had not that minstrel wandered half over Germany expressly to sing
under those walls? Hardly had the moon been up an hour, thus lighting a fearful way among those
ledges, when step by step, hand over hand, up climbed the boyish form of Blondel, by a footpath
way not by the guarded road, and with his harp upon his back. A moment to rest, a moment to
take breath and to turn with his golden key the peg that tightened a string,--then soft, low,
trembling like the wind that sweeps aimlessly, ceaselessly through the sighing forest branches
came the throbbing melody as the slender fingers strayed across the wires! whispering a song
of love of bygone days when two were wandering under a glad, sunny sky in a free land, where
birds in the near-by forest were nest-building, where sorrow, clouds and darkness were unknown.
Then as the moonlight shone like a star on the steel helmet of the watcher who leaned so breathlessly
over the battlements, into the night air far below him swung the rich, resonant voice of the
musician, the words clear and cleancut, and of such a penetrating sweetness that the ironsheathed
warrior above all unconsciously leaned still further over the stonework, and, hardened though
he was, made no pretense to stop slow tears that came to his eyes and fell, drop by drop, to
glitter like diamonds among the rough rocks far below.

The singer ceased. But the harp still kept up its rhythmic humming; and presently, muffled
by distance and winding passages, as it seemed out from the very stones of the rugged tower,
in a voice, harsh, strong, yet cultivated, came the second verse of that love-song, sung with
a full heart, throbbing with a newborn hope, sung as never before had it been rendered in the
old days when Blondel had taught it to Richard in sun-scorched Palestine!

The watcher sprang up at his post, troubled, alert. What did this portend? He leaned over to
seek that minstrel who sang to prisoners, and send an arrow through him; but the minstrel had
disappeared; nor was he heard from for weary weeks; but then came from England a demand for
release so peremptory that Henry sulkily felt compelled to accept the ransom money and set
King Richard free. Blithely the King took leave of his surly host whose hotel bill was so high,
as is somewhat the fashion in that region to this day. The sun shone gloriously as it seemed
sun never shone before. The birds made the air ring with music. Yet no melody that Richard
ever heard again was likely to seem as sweet to him as did that song of Blondel's when it came
stealing so helpfully through the narrow slits that served as windows in his dungeon cell.

This is the legend. Possibly it is true. In afterward doorway, at encounter of Richard and Ivanhoe

This made John very angry, but that did not give him the money for which he had so deeply sinned.
We in our day wonder that he himself was not put in prison and killed in punishment for the
deed. But kings had great powers in those days. They could condemn a man to death if they would;
if it was not done too often, the rest of the world felt to make sure that more heads were
not loose on their shoulders, and were too grateful to find them safe to murmur about the fate
of other heads, lest a worse thing befall.

Perhaps, when things became too bad, some revengeful man who had been deeply injured would
try to meet evil with evil by murdering the king, or by getting up a war against him. In either
case, many innocent men had to suffer from the evils that grew out of it.

But one day a better way was found. Louis of Daneshold was now a grave, broadshouldered, powerful
man. The Crusades had knit together the knights and barons of England into a close brotherhood,
and for the king to harm one was likely to arouse the wrath of all. The young men who had faced
the Saracens and fought shoulder to shoulder in Palestine were now in England the men of mark,
whose words had to be listened to and heeded by all who would keep out of trouble. Hotheaded
John was not one to put a check on his tongue when it would be wise to do so, and hardly was
Richard buried when John found himself at odds with Louis and his comrades. They would not
submit to his evil doings as king. They would not permit him to take for his own use the lands,
cattle, money which they had earned by hard fighting. And finally, when he had a war of his
own on his hands in Flanders, fighting French nobles, the English lords flatly refused to follow
him across the water, since they had neither love for him as a king nor confidence in him as
a leader; and as to the war itself it was king against baron, and they sided with the baron.
As a consequence, John came back to England again, well beaten; and he did not love those barons!

For a time after his return he tried to smooth things over and bring back the old way of kingly
rule once more. But those stern-eyed men, clad in steel, had tasted freedom. They knew their
own strength now. Was it likely that Louis of Daneshold, with the blood of Norse ancestors
in his veins, and those Crusader comrades of his, every whit as sturdy fighters, would hold
in great respect a tricky king, a murderer of little boys, a man who could not lead to victory
in his own battle? No! a thousand times no! And iron clanged on iron when word from the King
was brought to the nobles as they camped at London. Down came the mailed hand of many a knight
with a resounding blow.

"No compromise! no treaty, save on our own terms!" was their warcry, and what those terms were,
John Lackland of England was soon to know. One thousand two hundred and fifteen was the year;
twenty-four years after Richard's last Crusade, and his death. The world had been moving fast
meanwhile. Freedom was thought more of. The younger men had grown up to be great captains in
their turn; and in this year they did a deed which was far reaching, for we feel the effects
of it to this day.

Helmeted, and sword in hand, with a host of stalwart men-at-arms at their back, they called
on John at Runnymede. It was not a friendly call. There was too much iron present for that.
Iron glove meant iron hand that day, and John Lackland knew it. Sternly those assembled barons
told him that the time for smooth words was past. "The divine right" of kings had been held
up to the broad light of a modern day, and found to be motheaten by time. Its fabric was thin
as cobweb, and there was nothing "divine" about it; nothing but the plain fact that "king's
right" was merely the might of the strong, not the right of the just, and if it must come to
that, they were muscular Christians too, and could behead a man as well as another. So then
and there they laid before him a written agreement or "charter," as they called it, and told
him to place at the end of it the written signature of the king, which would thus make it the
law of the land.

It was a bitter moment for that sullen king. He would have refused to sign it had he dared.
But there, to right and left of him, scowled the menacing faces of the fiercest fighters in
all England. Crusader waved his hand to Crusader across the hall, and in that greeting the
low clash of steel rippled through the ranks. To refuse that signature meant--not the death
of his friends, his comrades, his helpers in doing evil. That result not greatly would have
troubled him. No! It meant what to him was a more serious matter. It was his own life now which
he must buy by his signature, or die. He was not ready for that, so John Lackland of England
signed the charter.

What a great thing for England and the world it was! for among other things the agreement read that

"NO FREEMAN SHALL BE IMPRISONED OR PUT TO DEATH, OR HAVE HIS PROPERTY TAKEN FROM HIM, BUT BY
THE JUDGMENT OF HIS PEERS (his equals) OR BY THE LAW OF THE LAND!"

And now, seven hundred years later, if it is claimed that a man does wrong and breaks the law
he is arrested and brought before a judge. But before that judge can sentence him to death
or long imprisonment the whole story is told before twelve men, called a jury, who decide whether
he deserves punishment or not. And this is the great gift handed down to us by those barons
of old from the days when, if he wished a person's death, it was enough for a king to say,
"I do not like that man!"

To this day we speak of that agreement as "the great charter;" or more often, we use the words
of the Latin language in which it was written (since all learned men then, whether Saxon, Norman,
French or Dane, could read and understand that common tongue) words which mean the same, and
we call it

"MAGNA CHARTA."

A thistle bloomed in a garden. A small boy forgot to pull it up. His twin sister saw it, but
said that thistle-pulling was not her work, so it went to seed. One seed was caught up by a
wind and went drifting, drifting, a little balloon of thistledown, until it reached the clouds
and travelled westward with them for thousands of miles. Then the cloud struck a mountain and
burst into rain. The seed went down among the drops. Months afterward a boy with a dark skin
came stealing along that mountain slope, trying to get shot at a deer, and put his bare knee
on an unknown plant that pricked him sharply,--so sharply that he said, "Oh!" or a word in
his language which meant the same. It was lucky for the deer, which took fright and ran away,
but the boy had no dinner that day.

I like to think that splinters from my Iron Star are journeying across the world somewhat more
solidly than thistledown, yet making themselves felt wherever they stop to rest. I like to
think that possibly one splinter was forged into the identical steel needle which formed the
indicator in the office of the first Atlantic cable, that three-thousand-mile-long wire, covered
with gutta percha to keep out the salt water, which was laid from England to America under
the ocean. You know that we telegraph by electricity, which is lightning in harness. But you
may not know that this first deep-sea wire sent messages which were read by the way in which
a flash of light was reflected in a mirror, wavering to and fro; and that the very first message
was a greeting of peace and goodwill from Queen Victoria to President Buchanan.

The first message sent by the cable read as follows:--

"To the President of the United States, Washington

"The Queen desires to congratulate the President upon the successful completion of this great
international work, in which the Queen has taken the greatest interest.

"The Queen has much pleasure in thus communicating with the President, and renewing to him
her wishes for the prosperity of the United States."

Men do not linger long around a battlefield after the fight is over, unless it is their fate
to stay there forever; and with rattle of mailed harness and blare of trumpet-calls the Crusaders
tramped heavily away through the sand, leaving behind them here and there a red spot on the
earth, here and there a Saracen. Then, in time, a lightfooted, lightfingered troop of Arabs
dashed into the little valley, sharply scanning the ground to right and left for forgotten
weapons worth the picking up.
