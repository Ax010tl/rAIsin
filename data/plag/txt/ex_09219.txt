Annie pulled herself up and accused herself of getting absolutely maudlin. The idea of Tom
Robinson of "Robinson's," with his middle size, matter-of-fact air, and foxy hair and moustache,
entertaining such a dream and relinquishing it with a pang of mortal anguish that would leave
a long sickening heart-ache behind! It was the infection of all the silly love stories she
had ever read which had received a kind of spurious galvanic life from the very ordinary circumstance,
the feather in her cap, as so many girls would have regarded it, of Dora, having to receive
and refuse an offer of marriage. Why, she--Annie--and her sisters, including Dora herself,
had been much diverted by it, as well as interested in it, until the dramatic crisis had somehow
taken their breath away also, and startled them by a glimpse of the other side of the question.
But though Annie strove to recover her equanimity, and Rose tried to hum a tune softly as the
girls still loitered behind the bannisters, to see the end of the play, they said nothing more
to each other; a sort of shyness and shame had stolen over them. It was not enough to make
them run away, especially as each did not realize that what she felt was common to all. Only
their lips were chained simultaneously, and they were disposed to turn aside their heads and
avert their eyes, like Dora when she killed her man.

The deed did not take long--not more than was necessary for him to plead once or twice with
small variation on the words, "Will you not think of it, Dora? Can you not give it a little
consideration? Perhaps if I were to wait, and you were to try----"

And for Dora to answer with drooping head, panting breast, and still less variety in her phrases,
"Oh, no, no, Mr. Tom. Of course, I am very much obliged to you for thinking a great deal more
of me than I deserve. He is lead to hoping your predetermination is be very nothing by dignity. She

"Hold your tongue, you little goose," remonstrated the disturbed Annie. "He may hear you. School-girls
like you and Rose should not meddle in grown-up people's affairs."

"I thought I had left school after the Christmas holidays," said Rose, interrogating the world
in an abstract fashion. She was herself again on the instant, carrying her funny little crumpled
nose well in the air.

"It is dreadful," said May, with a half-suppressed sob, "and he was so good-natured. He promised
only last week to get Rose and me a fox-terrier puppy."

"Oh, you selfish little creature! It is over the failure of the prospective puppy and not over
the sorrows of the rejected man you are lamenting. Never mind, Maisie, I doubt if mother would
have allowed us to keep the puppy. As for Mr. Tom Robinson, he is cut up just now, of course;
but he will soon get over it. How long does it take a man to forget, Annie? Anyhow, presently
he will be busily directing his attentions in another quarter, until the day may come, after
he is successful and triumphant, well pleased with himself and his choice, when he will heartily
thank Dora there for having administered to him the cold bath of a rejection, so nipping his
first raw aspirations in the bud."

"No, no," insisted May; "you are so cynical, Rose, like everybody else now-a-days, and I hate
it. He can never be glad to have lost Dora."

"Don't you agree with me, Annie?" Rose maintained her point.

"Really, you seem to be so well informed on the subject yourself--though I cannot think where
you have got your experience, any more than your slang, unless at second-hand"--said Annie
sarcastically, "that my opinion is of no importance."

"Now, don't be nasty and elder-sisterish," was Rose's quick rejoinder.

Though Dora shed no tears of contrition in public, Annie, who shared her sister's room, heard
her in the night crying softly.

"What ails you, Dora dear?" Annie sat up and asked sleepily. "What is the matter? It can't
be, no," rousing herself, "it can not be--you don't mean that you repent what you've done,
and would swallow the shop, foxy hair, and everything?"

"Oh, no," denied Dora, "but I didn't think a man would care like that; such a queer, gray shade
came over his face, though I durst hardly look at him; and his hands which were--well, were
holding mine for a second, you know----"

"No, I don't know," interrupted Annie, smiling to herself; "but go on, what about the hands?"

"They were as cold as ice."

"Very likely, it is only the month of April."

"And it is not above a year since he lost both his father and mother--all the near relations
he had."

"Poor man!" admitted Annie. "But you could not help that, and many men, young men especially,
seem to get on quite well without near relations."

There was a strain of hardness about pretty Annie, whether bred of that cynicism in the air
of which May had complained, whether it was an integral part of Annie, or whether, as in the
case of some valuable kinds of timber, it was merely an indication of the closer grain, the
slower ripening, and the greater power of endurance of the moral fibre.

"Men are not like women." Annie was continuing her lecture. "I dare say Tom Robinson will do
very well--all the better, perhaps, because he has no ambition, and is content to make money
in the most humdrum way as a tradesman."

Dora sat up in turn, like a white ghost in her place in her little bed, seen by the dim light.
She had the instinct which causes women to look back upon the men who have made love or proposed
to them, even though the women have rejected the men--as in a sense their property, if not
their prey, so as not by any means to relish the men's depreciation at the hands of other women.
Then it becomes a point of honour alike with the proudest and the meekest of her sex to stand
up in his absence in defence of the discarded swain.

"I don't know about ambition," began Dora hesitatingly, "but father says Tom Robinson is not
at all stupid; he took his degree with credit at Cambridge, and was not plucked like poor Ned
Hewett, or that fop, Cyril Carey. Father says when he worked with Mr. Robinson in getting up
the bill to lay before Parliament for closing the old churchyard, he could not have desired
a more intelligent, diligent fellow-worker. All the salesmen and women at 'Robinson's' have
been well looked after, and are superior to the other shop-people in the town, don't you know?
There is Miss Franklin at the head of both the millinery and mantua-making departments; I am
sure she looks and speaks, as well as dresses, like a lady?"

"Yes, and everybody is civil to her, but nobody thinks of making her acquaintance out of the
shop, and she is wise enough to keep to her proper sphere. They say she is a distant relation
of Tom Robinson's--you see he is not altogether destitute of kindred. Why does the man not
marry her? That would be a suitable match."

"Annie!" protested Dora, in nearly speechless indignation, and then she recovered breath and
words. "She's forty if she's a day; and she's as fat as a pin-cushion, with her cheeks a mottled
red all over."

"How can you make such unkind remarks on your neighbours' looks? He is not an Adonis, I may
be allowed to say; and I have noticed that shopkeepers are apt to marry women older than themselves,
women who have been in the trade--to keep the business together, I suppose."

"At least, his father did not marry like that either in his first or in his second marriage,"
retorted Dora; "for the first Mrs. Robinson was the daughter of a curate, and the second of
a farmer, and she was not half his age, though she did not survive him long."

"As you please. What's Hecuba to me, or what am I to Hecuba?" demanded Annie airily.

"Besides," Dora returned laboriously to the charge, "there are shopkeepers and shopkeepers,
as you must be aware, Annie. Father says old Mr. Robinson was a man of independent ideas and
original mind, and had his own theories of trade."

"I have nothing to say against it, especially at this hour of the night, or morning," said
Annie, professing to strangle a yawn; "only that I do not think a linen-draper's business,
however large and well-conducted, is exactly the career of a gentleman, a man of fair ability
and education. He might leave it to any respectable well-disposed tradesman. However, if you
are going to exalt Tom Robinson, with his shop, into a patriot and philanthropist cherishing
a noble scheme for the public good, and all that kind of thing, do it if you like, nobody will
hinder you. Call him back if you care to, I dare say it is still possible if you are willing
to make the concession. But oh, Dora!" appealed Annie, who had talked herself wide awake by
this time, "don't forget the loss of position involved in really keeping a shop, however eccentric
and meritorious a man's intentions may be. Why, he had better become a stonemason or a ploughman,
if he is to do the thing at all; far better a gamekeeper or a soldier in time of war, the plunge
would be deeper but more picturesque. Think of the entire breaking with the county with which
we have a right to hold ourselves connected, not merely because father's patients are willing
to take us up and make quite a fuss about us sometimes, but because his Aunt Penny married
and was welcomed into that set. You have not yourself alone to consider, remember, Dora; you
might not mind, but you have the rest of us to think of, some of whom would mind very much."

"You need have no anxiety about the matter," said poor Dora hotly and huffily. "I am not going
to marry Tom Robinson; you know I have refused him this very afternoon."

But Annie was determined to empty out her whole budget of warnings. "Even professional people
like father, all our friends and acquaintances, our relations on both sides of the house would
begin to drop us, and fight shy of us. What people that had any pretensions to being gentle-folks
would care to be mixed up with our brother-in-law the linen-draper? And it is not as if the
temptation were great; I cannot see wherein the attraction lies; but instead of letting it
beset you, please don't lose sight of the three hundred and sixty-five days to be spent every
year in Tom Robinson's silent company. Think of the three hundred and sixty-five breakfasts,
dinners, and suppers to be eaten opposite his mute figure."

"Stop, Annie," Dora cried energetically: "you know as well as I do that I could never face
such a thing, that I never dreamt of it. Only loving a man could make it possible for a girl
to give up her family in order to belong to him; and even if there had been no 'Robinson's'
to shock you, I do not care the least little bit for poor Tom Robinson; yet surely for that
very reason," protested Dora with a sudden revulsion of feeling, "I am at liberty to pity him."

"If you will take my advice, Dora," said shrewd Annie, sinking back on her pillow as a sign
that the untimely discussion ought to come to an end, "you will get rid of your pity as quickly
as you can. It is not your pity which he seeks--very likely he would rage like a bear, for
as quiet as he can look, at the mere mention of it. But it strikes me that it is not safe for
either of you."

CHAPTER III.

THE HEADS OF THE HOUSE LOOK GRAVE.

"It is a thousand pities," said Dr. Millar, holding a consultation with his wife, while he
sipped his glass of sherry and ate his biscuit, before retiring for the night, after his last
round among the patients in greatest need of his visits.

In spite of his daughter Dora's preference for tall men, the Doctor was short and rather stout.
He ought to have looked comfortable, he had the physique and air of a comfortable man, but
a certain harassed, careworn expression was beginning to settle down on the spectacled face
which had once been round, rosy, and very comely. He was at least twenty years older than his
wife. The old-fashioned practice had prevailed in the old-fashioned town, of elderly men, whether
bachelors or widowers, ending by marrying for the first or the second time women a score or
more years their juniors. Indeed, Dr. Millar was hard upon seventy, though he had till recent
bad times carried his years so well that he had looked ten years younger than his actual age.

Mrs. Millar also began to look worried as a rule, though she had more of the woman's faculty
of putting the best face on things, both in public and in private. She was a tall woman, who
had enjoyed the advantages of what was called "an elegant figure" in her youth. Now she was
large and heavy, with a mixture of unconscious stateliness and wistful motherliness in her
gait and gestures. Like Dr. Millar, she ought to have seemed at least easy-minded, but circumstances
were becoming more and more against the happy condition, of which a pervading atmosphere of
content and cheerfulness should have been the outward expression.

The man and woman were not cut out, so to speak, for adversity. They had not been seasoned
to it in their younger days. On the contrary, they had been cradled for many years in the lap--if
not of luxury, of fair middle-class prosperity. It was a few tolerably rough jolts which had
shaken them from their cradle. Still the trouble was more in apprehension than in reality.
As yet it had not caused the sufferers to change any one of the domestic habits which had grown
second nature to them. It had not induced them to darken the sunny sky over their young daughters'
heads with a shadow of the clouds which were already looming black on the parents' horizon.
It may be said at once, that Dr. and Mrs. Millar, though they were reckoned clever, sensible
people enough by their contemporaries, had softer hearts than they had hard heads. They had
not been used to painful self-denial and stern discipline, either where they themselves or
their children were concerned.

The couple were sitting now together in the dining-room with its solidly handsome furniture,
Russian leather and walnut wood, bits of family plate on the sideboard, bronze chimney-piece
ornaments, and good engravings on the walls. Husband and wife had spent the last part of the
evening there, for four-and-twenty years, every night they were in Redcross, when the Doctor
was not kept out late, or when the couple were not abroad in company, or seeing company at
home. Dr. Millar, in his slightly old-fashioned professional black coat and white tie, was
leaning back in his easy-chair sipping his sherry, and occasionally drumming lightly on the
table near him with these fine long sensitive fingers which were a born doctor's fingers.

Mrs. Millar wore a demi-toilet in the shape of an expensive cashmere and silk gown--not an
evening dress, but an approach to it, as became the wife of one of the leading professional
men in Redcross, connected with the county to boot. Her lace cap was a costly trifle of its
kind, but it had an awkward habit--the odder in a woman who was neat to formality in the other
details of her dress--of slipping to one side, or tilting forwards or backwards on the brown
hair, still abundant and just streaked with gray; so that one or other of her daughters was
constantly calling Mrs. Millar's cap to order and setting it right. She was sitting in an arm-chair,
opposite her husband. Mechanically she put one daintily slippered, very neat foot, considering
the weight it helped to carry, beyond her skirts, and stretched it towards the fire. There
was still a good fire blazing in the steel grate, though the spring was well advanced, the
weather was not more than chilly, and the hour was late. It was as if coals were not a marketable
commodity and a serious item in the expenses of an embarrassed household. She held up a Japanese
fan between her face and the fire, from mere custom, for she had ceased to pay much heed to
the exigencies of a florid complexion.

"It's a thousand pities," repeated the little Doctor, looking quite portentously regretful
and oppressed. "It is not only that Tom Robinson is an excellent fellow and would have made
Dora the best of husbands--given her a safe and happy home, and all that sort of thing; but
in case of anything happening, I am convinced he would have been as good as a brother to the
other girls, and a son to you. A man like him is a stay and support to a household of helpless
women."

"But nothing is going to happen, Jonathan," said Mrs. Millar, with an involuntary nervous quiver
which sent her cap hovering over one eyebrow. "At least nothing worse than we know. Your practice
is not so lucrative as it used to be; how can it, in these bad times, with so many poor young
fellows of doctors settling here and there and everywhere in Redcross and the villages around,
starving themselves out, while they impoverish their seniors? Nothing more than that, except
the little trouble at Carey's Bank."

"Quite enough too, Maria, quite enough," commented the Doctor deep down in his throat, prolonging
the words a little as if he were chanting the refrain of a dismal song; "and when a man is
my age and has plenty of the young rivals you refer to, it is high time he should be looking
out for something happening. A family of girls, too. God help me! If they had been four boys,
who might have made their own way in the world, and provided for you among them, I could have
faced it better." He struck the table again, with spasmodic force this time.

"Now, Jonathan, you will wake up the house. This is not like you," remonstrated his wife--all
the more energetically that her heart sank while she spoke. "I should not have expected you
to give way in this manner." She gave a quick push back to her unruly cap. "I am sure there
is no occasion for it. We are in no worse position than we were last year, even the year before
that."

"Save that I am growing older every year," he said grimly, "and the affairs of the bank are
not mending, as I hoped they might."

"Can't you sell out?" she suggested breathlessly, as she clasped her hands on her knees.

"I have put it off too long, supposing I had the conscience to transfer my liabilities to some
simpleton who might not draw half a dozen of the dividends of which I have drawn scores. Besides,
the thing is impossible, as I am telling you. Between you and me, the shares are far below par."

"What is par, Jonathan?" interrupted Mrs. Millar in a praiseworthy attempt to understand her
husband.

"Oh, bother," he cried, running his hand in mild exasperation through his white hair; "the
standard value, or the original value, whichever you like best. I should not dare to propose
to sell out at such a loss; it would not only be to impoverish myself at once in order to avoid
the risk of greater ruin, it would draw attention. It would have a most suspicious look, and
might bring the rotten affair down about our ears instantly, while I should get the blame of
the downfall."

"But some of the large foreign investments might be realized any day--you told me the last
time you spoke of business--with the first good turn of trade," she reminded him anxiously.

"I trust so still, and I believe old Carey is an honest man and a perfect gentleman--that is
one comfort; but I cannot help thinking he has got into bad hands. I tell you, Maria, I don't
like that brother-in-law of his who comes down from London to attend the Redcross meetings,
and tries to blarney us all round. And I cannot approve of the bolstering up of Carey's cousins,
the Carters, in their chemical works at Stokeleigh, which it strikes me will never do much
good. It--the bolstering up--has been going on for a long time now, to what extent I am not
prepared to show. Unfortunately I have a bad head for figures," he shrugged his shoulders as
if anticipating a reproach, "the less reason why I should have laid out my savings on bank
shares, you will say? No doubt, no doubt, but there had been fewer troubles with banks in my
day. When I made the first investment everything appeared right, and the dividends announced
were tempting."

"I am not finding fault with what you did, Jonathan; I never thought of such a thing," the
perturbed woman found voice to reassure her husband. "I know you did it for the best; and for
that matter, I am convinced it will all come right in the end," she ended with a little sigh.

You yourself, Dr. Millar, are fairly well born and well connected for a professional man."
She instanced this with an imperceptible bridle and toss of her matronly head, which hinted
broadly, "If it had not been so, Jonathan, I should never have been Mrs. Millar." The movement
threatened to deposit her cap on the carpet behind her, but she recovered it in time, and took
up the thread of her discourse by quoting the much-prized family distinction--"There was your
Aunt Penny, who married into the county."

"Oh! are you at that humbug?" he cried, with a man's disrespectful impatience. "I thought it
had seen its day, and was long over and done with. I could not have conceived that you--" ("were
such a fool," he was going to say, when he caught himself up.) He was quick-tempered and impulsive,
but he was also suave by nature, and his long habit of courteous indulgence to his wife caused
him to alter the phrase. "I did not know that you had so lively an imagination as to persist
in believing that old myth, Maria."

"But your Aunt Penny did marry one of the Beauchamps of Waylands," insisted Mrs. Millar.

"Certainly; and she made the poorest marriage of anybody that I have ever had to do with, though
I have always understood that he was not a bad sort, beyond being as thick-headed as his brother
the squire or an officer of dragoons. He get on at the bar! I dare say not. And he was no quicker-witted
or longer-sighted in Australia. You must have heard me say how grieved I was once when I came
across a fellow from Sydney who had been up the country, and remembered something of the Beauchamps
and their straits. They were regularly hard up, and went through no end of trouble. Poor Aunt
Penny seldom had a woman-servant--women-servants were more difficult to get out there in those
days. She had to wash, cook, and scour for the men at the station."

"Why didn't they come home?" inquired Mrs. Millar rather weakly.

"Come home! They had nothing to come home with, or to. You don't suppose his brother, the squire,
with a wife and family of his own, would have kept them, though the Beauchamps had received
her civilly enough at the time of the marriage! She had to milk the cows when the cow-man was
otherwise wanted. I do not say that many a better born woman than she was has not done as much
and thought little of it, only it was not in Aunt Penny's line. I can just remember her when
I was a small boy, a pretty creature who read Italian, sang to her guitar, and made bread seals
for her amusement. She had such a mortal terror where cows were concerned that she would run
like a lapwing when she heard one come lowing up the lane behind the house. Paton, the man
from Sydney who remembered them, thought they did a little better towards the end, when they
got a store, and Mrs. Beauchamp kept it. She run them scarcely come up any terror from cows of
terror style which makes otherwise many lowing translations and peculiar
beauchamp of read, one the stiffness of one walking up in new cows,--
the result to the words were of one language in the thought of another.
 She illustrated this by adding, in an undertone, "They were in
Australia."

"A store," continued the Doctor, "is the rudest, most uncouth kind of shop; and Beauchamp was
not fit to keep it, he had to turn it over to his wife, who was thankful to serve shepherds
and bush-rangers for aught I know. She lost one child in the bush, God help her! The little
thing wandered away and was never heard of again; and her other child, a boy, who grew up,
did not turn out well. I tell you, I never like to think or speak of the mother."
