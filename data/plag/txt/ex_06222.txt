We had so far scored; but now ensued a period of stalemate. We were being fired at from the
river-bank on the north, and from anthills, etc., pretty well all round, and were also under
the intermittent shell-fire from the two guns. They made most excellent practice at the huts,
which were soon knocked to bits, but not till they had well served their turn. Some of the
new white sandbags from inside the huts were scattered out in full view of the enemy, and it
was instructive to see what a splendid target they made for rifle-fire, and how often they
were hit. They must have drawn a lot of fire away from the actual trenches. Until the Boers
discovered that they could advance south from the drift without being under rifle-fire from
our position, they were held up.

Would they discover it? As they had ridden all round us by now, well out of range, they must
know all about us and our isolation.

After dark, by which time we had one man killed and two wounded, the firing died away into
a continuous but desultory rifle-fire, with an occasional dropping shell from the guns. Under
cover of dark, I tried to guard the drift and dead ground to the south of it, by men standing
up and firing at that level, but towards midnight I was forced to withdraw them into the trenches,
after several casualties, as the enemy then apparently woke up and kept up a furious rifle-fire
upon us for over an hour. During this time the guns went through some mysterious evolutions.
At first we got it very hot from the north, where the guns had been all along. Then suddenly
a gun was opened on us away from the southwest, and we were shelled for a short time from both
sides. After a little the shelling on the north ceased, and continued from the southwest only
for twenty minutes. After this the guns ceased, and the rifle-fire also gradually died away.

When day dawned not a living soul was to be seen; there were the dead men, horses, and the
deserted wagons. I feared a trap, but gradually came to the conclusion the Boers had retired.
After a little we discovered the river-bed was deserted as well, but the Boers had not retired.
They had discovered the dead ground, and under the mutually supporting fire of their guns,
which had kept us to our trenches, had all crossed the drift and trekked south.

True, we were not captured, and had very few losses, and had severely mauled the enemy, but
they had crossed the drift. It must have evidently been of great importance to them to go on,
or they would have attempted to capture us, as they were about 500 to our 50.

I had failed in my duty.

During the next few hours we buried the dead, tended the wounded, and took some well-earned
rest, and I had ample leisure to consider my failure and the causes. The lessons I derived
from the fight were:

20. Beware of convex hills and dead ground. Especially take care to have some place where the
enemy must come under your fire. Choose the exact position of your firing-trenches, with your
eye at the level of the men who will eventually use them.

21. A hill may not, after all, though it has "command," be the best place to hold necessarily.

22. A conspicuous "bluff" trench may cause the enemy to waste much ammunition, and draw fire
away from the actual defences.

In addition to these lessons, another little matter on my mind was what my colonel would say
at my failure.

Lying on my back, looking up at the sky, I was trying to get a few winks of sleep myself before
we started to improve our defences against a possible further attack, but it was no use, sleep
evaded me.

The clear blue vault of heaven was suddenly overcast by clouds, which gradually assumed the
frowning face of my colonel. "What? You mean to say, Mr. Forethought, the Boers have crossed?"
But, luckily for me, before more could be said, the face began slowly to fade away like that
of the Cheshire Puss in "Alice in Wonderland," leaving nothing but the awful frown across the
sky. This too finally dissolved, and the whole scene changed. I had another dream.

SIXTH DREAM.

    "Sweet are the uses of adversity."

Once more was I fated to essay the task of defending Duffer's Drift. This time I had twenty-two
lessons below my belt to help me out, and in the oblivion of my dream I was saved that sense
of monotony which by now may possibly have overtaken you, "gentle reader."

After sending out the patrols, and placing a guard on Waschout Hill, as already described,
and whilst the stores were being collected, I considered deeply what position I should take
up, and walked up to the top of Waschout Hill to spy out the land. On the top I found a Kaffir
kraal, which I saw would assist me much to concealment should I decide to hold this hill. This
I was very inclined to do, but after a few minutes' trial of the shape of the ground, with
the help of some men walking about down below, and my eyes a little above ground-level--I found
that its convexity was such that, to see and fire on the drift and the approach on the south
side, I should have to abandon the top of the hill, and so the friendly concealment of the
Kaffir huts, and take up a position on the open hillside some way down. This was, of course,
quite feasible, especially if I held a position at the top of the hill as well, near the huts
on the east and southeast sides; but, as it would be impossible to really conceal ourselves
on the bare hillside, it meant giving up all idea of surprising the enemy, which I wished to
do. I must, therefore, find some other place which would lend itself to easy and good concealment,
and also have the drift or its approaches under close rifle-fire. But where to find such a place?

As I stood deep in thought, considering this knotty problem, an idea gently wormed itself into
my mind, which I at once threw out again as being absurd and out of the question. This idea
was--to hold the river bed and banks on each side of the drift! To give up all idea of command,
and, instead of seeking the nearest high ground, which comes as natural to the student of tactics
as rushing for a tree does to a squirrel, to take the lowest ground, even though it should
be all among thick cover, instead of being nicely in the open.

No, it was absolutely revolutionary, and against every canon I had ever read or heard of; it
was evidently the freak of a sorely tried and worried brain. The peak summer months and the absence
of observations in the winter months are individual. Significant bears probably enter and leave
where the Park in the course for their normal wanderings; however bears probably hibernate yards, breed,
and bear young Park and should not be regarded where merely occasionally wandering to the Park. Procyon
length pallidus Merriam Raccoon in December, 1959, three raccoons
were seen on 150 Prater Grade and later three were seen in Morfield
Canyon of the tunnel.



The advantages I thus hoped to obtain were--

Perfect concealment and cover from sight.

Trenches and protection against both rifle and gun fire practically ready made.

Communications under good cover.

The enemy would be out in the open veldt except along the river-bank, where we, being in position
first, would still have the advantage.

Plentiful water-supply at hand.

True, there were a few dead animals near the drift, and the tainted air seemed to hang heavy
over the river-bed, but the carcasses could be quickly buried under the steep banks, and, after
all, one could not expect every luxury.

As our clear field of fire, which in the north was only bounded by the range of our rifles,
was on the south limited by Waschout Hill, a suitable position for the enemy to occupy, I decided
to hold the top of it as well as the river-bed. All I could spare for this would be two N.C.O.'s
and eight men, who would be able to defend the south side of the hill, the north being under
our fire from the river-bank.

Having detailed this party, I gave my instructions for the work, which was soon started. In
about a couple of hours the patrols returned with their prisoners, which were dealt with as before.

For the post on Waschout Hill, the scheme was that the trenches should be concealed much in
the same way as described in the last dream, but great care should be taken that no one in
the post should be exposed to rifle-fire from our main position in the river. I did not wish
the fire of the main body to be in any degree hampered by a fear of hitting the men on Waschout
Hill, especially at night. If we knew it was not possible to hit them, we could shoot freely
all over the hill. This detachment was to have a double lot of water-bottles, besides every
available receptacle collected in the kraal, filled with water, in anticipation of a prolonged
struggle.

The general idea for the main defensive position was to hold both sides of the river, improving
the existing steep banks and ravines into rifle-pits to contain from one to four men. These
could, with very little work, be made to give cover from all sides. As such a large amount
of the work was already done for us, we were enabled to dig many more of these pits than the
exact number required for our party. Pathways leading between these were to be cut into the
bank, so that we should be able to shift about from one position to another. Besides the advantage
this would give us in the way of moving about, according as we wished to fire, it also meant
that we should probably be able to mislead the enemy as to our numbers--which, by such shifting
tactics might, for a time at least, be much exaggerated. The pits for fire to the north and
south were nearly all so placed as to allow the occupants to fire at ground-level over the
veldt. They were placed well among the bushes, only just sufficient scrub being cut away to
allow a man to see all round, without exposing the position of his trench. On each side of
the river, just by the drift, were some "spoil" heaps of earth, excavated from the road ramp.
These stood some five or six feet above the general level, and were as rough as the banks in
outline. These heaps were large enough to allow of a few pits being made on them, which had
the extra advantage of height. In some of the pits, to give head-cover, loopholes of sandbags
were made, though in most cases this was not needed, owing to the concealment of the bushes.
I found it was necessary to examine personally every loophole, and correct the numerous mistakes
made in their construction. Some had the new clean sandbags exposed to full view, thus serving
as mere whited sepulchres to their occupants, others were equally conspicuous from their absurd
cock-shy appearance, others were not bullet-proof, whilst others again would allow of shooting
in one direction, or into the ground at a few yards' range, or up into the blue sky. As I corrected
all these faults I thought that loopholes not made under supervision might prove rather a snare.

The result was, in the way of concealment, splendid. From these pits with our heads at ground-level
we could see quite clearly out on to the veldt beyond, either from under the thicker part of
the bushes or even through those which were close to our eyes. From the open, on the other
hand, we were quite invisible, even from 300 yards' distance, and would have been more so had
we had the whiskers of the "brethren." It was quite evident to me that these same whiskers
were a wise provision of nature for this very purpose and part of her universal scheme of protective
mimicry.

The numerous small dongas and rifts lent themselves readily to flanking fire, and in many places
the vertical banks required no cutting in order to give ideal protection against even artillery.
In others, the sides of the crooked waterways had to be merely scooped out a little, or a shelf
cut to stand upon.

In one of these deeper ravines two tents, which, being below ground-level, were quite invisible,
were pitched for the women and children, and small caves cut for them in case of a bombardment.
The position extended for a length of some 150 yards on each side of the drift along both banks
of the river, and at its extremities, where an attack was most to be feared, pits were dug
down the river-banks and across the dry river-bed. He dodged, growling and snapping, among the weeds,
and none at last ran myself into the lot in which there were stacks of lumber and junk and many
hiding-places. The dog was there; but he escaped before I could
get a shooting at him. I was undecided for some time as to whether to clear
a "field of fire" along the river-banks or not, as I had no wish to give away our presence
by any suspicious nudity of the banks at each end of our position. I finally decided, in order
to prevent this, to clear the scrub for as great a range as possible from the ends of the position,
everywhere below the ground-level, and also on the level ground, except for a good fringe just
on the edges of the banks. This fringe I thought would be sufficient to hide the clearance
to any one not very close. I now blessed the man who had left us some cutting tools. Whilst
all this was being carried out, I paced out some ranges to the north and south, and these we
marked by a few empty tins placed on ant-heaps, etc.

At dusk, when we had nearly all the pits finished and some of the clearance done, tents and
gear were hidden, ammunition and rations distributed to all, and orders in case of an attack
given out. As I could not be everywhere, I had to rely on the outlying groups of men fully
understanding my aims beforehand, and acting on their "own." To prevent our chance of a close-range
volley into the enemy being spoilt by some over-zealous or jumpy man opening fire at long range,
I gave orders that fire was to be held as long as possible, and that no man was to fire a shot
until firing had already commenced elsewhere (which sounded rather Irish), or my whistle sounded.
This was unless the enemy were so close to him that further silence was useless. Firing having
once started, every man was to blaze away at any enemy within range as judged by our range
marks. Finally, we turned in to our pits for the night with some complacency, each eight men
furnishing their own sentry.

We had about three hours next morning before any enemy were reported from Waschout Hill (the
pre-arranged signal for this was the raising of a pole from one of the huts). This time was
employed in perfecting our defences in various ways. We managed to clear away the scrub in
the dry river-bed and banks for some 200 yards beyond our line of pits on each side, and actually
attained to the refinement of an "obstacle;" for at the extremity of this clearance a sort
of abatis entanglement was made with the wire from an adjacent fence which the men had discovered.
During the morning I visited the post on Waschout Hill, found everything correct, and took
the opportunity of showing the detachment the exact limits of our position in the river-bed,
and explained what we were going to do. After about three hours' work, "Somebody in sight"
was signalled, and we soon after saw from our position a cloud of dust away to the north. This
force, which proved to be a commando, approached as already described in the last dream; all
we could do meanwhile was to sit tight in concealment. Their scouts came on in clumps of twos
and threes which extended over some mile of front, the centre of the line heading for the drift.
As the scouts got closer, the natural impulse to make for the easiest crossing place was obeyed
by two or three of the parties on each side of the one approaching the drift, and they inclined
inwards and joined forces with it. This was evidently the largest party we could hope to surprise,
and we accordingly lay for it. When about 300 yards away, the "brethren" stopped rather suspiciously.
This was too much for some man on the east side, who let fly, and the air was rent by the rattle
as we emptied our magazines, killing five of this special scouting party and two from other
groups further out on either side. We continued to fire at the scouts as they galloped back,
dropping two more, and also at the column which was about a mile away, but afforded a splendid
target till it opened out.

In a very few moments our position was being shelled by three guns, but with the only result,
as far as we were concerned, of having one man wounded by shell-fire, though the firing went
on slowly till dark. To be accurate, I should say the river was being shelled, our position
incidentally, for shells were bursting along the river for some half mile. The Boers were evidently
quite at sea as regards the extent of our position and strength, and wasted many shells. We
noticed much galloping of men away to the east and west, out of range, and guessed that these
were parties who intended to strike the river at some distance away, and gradually work along
the bed, in order probably to get into close range during the night.

We exchanged a few shots during the night along the river bed, and not much was done on either
side, though of course we were on the qui vive all the time; but it was not till near one in
the morning that Waschout Hill had an inning.

As I had hoped, the fact that we held the kraal had not been spotted by the enemy, and a large
body of them, crawling up the south side of the hill in order to get a good fire on to us in
the river, struck a snag in the shape of a close-range volley from our detachment. As the night
was not very dark, in the panic following the first volley our men were able (as I learnt afterwards)
to stand right up and shoot at the surprised burghers bolting down the hill. However, their
panic did not last long, to judge by the sound, for after the first volley from our Lee-Metfords
and the subsequent minute's independent firing, the reports of our rifles were soon mingled
with the softer reports of the Mausers, and we shortly observed flashes on our side of Waschout
Hill. As these could not be our men, we knew the enemy were endeavoring to surround the detachment.
We knew the ranges fairly well, and though, as we could not see our sights, the shooting was
rather guesswork, we soon put a stop to this manoeuvre by firing a small volley from three
or four rifles at each flash on the hill-side. So the night passed without much incident.

During the dark we had taken the opportunity cunningly to place some new white sandbags (which
I had found among the stores) in full view at some little distance from our actual trenches
and pits. The specimen listed last (69325) was an male recovered from the stomach in a rocky
(snout-peeping vent length 334 mm., wt. 26.0 gms.) Crotalus viridus that was trapped on a Museum
small mouse-trap of a slope mostly barren of vegetation. Next morning
it was quite a pleasure to see the very accurate shooting made by "Brother" at these sandbags,
as betokened by the little spurts of dust.

During this day the veldt to the north and south was deserted by the enemy except at out-of-range
distance, but a continuous sniping fire was kept up along the river-banks on each side. The
Boer guns were shifted--one to the top of Incidentamba and one to the east and west in order
to enfilade the river bank--but, owing to our good cover, we escaped with two killed and three
wounded. The enemy did not shell quite such a length of river this time. I confidently expected
an attack along the river bank that night, and slightly strengthened my flanks, even at the
risk of dangerously denuding the north bank. I was not disappointed.

Under cover of the dark, the enemy came up to within, perhaps, 600 yards on the open veldt
on the north and round the edges of Waschout Hill, on the south, and kept up a furious fire,
probably to distract our attention, whilst the guns shelled us for about an hour. As soon as
the gun-fire ceased they tried to rush us along the river-bed east and west, but owing to the
abatis and the holes in the ground, and the fact that it was not a very dark night, they were
unsuccessful. However, it was touch and go, and a few of the Boers did succeed in getting into
our position only to be bayoneted. Luckily the enemy did not know our strength, or rather our
weakness, or they would have persisted in their attempt and succeeded; as it was, they must
have lost 20 or 30 men killed and wounded.

Next morning, with so many men out of my original 40 out of action (not to include Waschout
Hill, whose losses I did not know), matters seemed to be serious, and I was greatly afraid
that another night would be the end of us. I was pleased to see that the detachment on Waschout
Hill had still got its tail well up, for they had hoisted a red rag at the masthead. True,
this was not the national flag, probably only a mere handkerchief, but it was not white. The
day wore on with intermittent shelling and sniping, and we all felt that the enemy must have
by now guessed our weakness, and were saving themselves for another night attack, relying upon
our being tired out. We did our best to snatch a little sleep by turns during the day, and
I did all I could to keep the spirits of the little force up by saying that relief could not
be very far off. But it was with a gloomy desperation at best that we saw the day wear on and
morning turn into afternoon.

The Boer guns had not been firing for some two hours, and the silence was just beginning to
get irritating and mysterious, when the booming of guns in the distance aroused us to the highest
pitch of excitement. We were saved! We could not say what guns these were--they might be British
or Boer--but, any way, it proved the neighborhood of another force. All faces lighted up, for
somehow the welcome sound at once drew the tired feeling out of us.

In order to prevent any chance of the fresh force missing our whereabouts, I collected a few
men and at once started to fire some good old British volleys into the scrub, "Ready--present--fire,"
which were not to be mistaken. Shortly afterwards we heard musketry in the distance, and saw
a cloud of dust to the northeast. We were relieved!

       *       *       *       *       *

Our total losses were 11 killed and 15 wounded; but we had held the drift, and so enabled a
victory to be won. I need not here touch upon the well-known and far-reaching results of the
holding of Duffer's Drift, of the prevention thereby of Boer guns, ammunition, and reinforcements
reaching one of their sorely pressed forces at a critical moment, and the ensuing victory gained
by our side. It is now, of course, all public knowledge that this was the turning-point in
the war, though we, the humble instruments, did not know what vital results hung upon our action.

That evening the relieving force halted at the drift, and, after burying the dead, we spent
some time examining the lairs of the Boer snipers, the men collecting bits of shell and cartridge-cases
as mementoes--only to be thrown away at once. We found some 25 dead and partially buried Boers,
to whom we gave burial.

That night I did not trek, but lay down (in my own breeches and spotted waistcoat). As the
smoke from the "prime segar," presented to me by my Colonel, was eddying in spirals over my
head, these gradually changed into clouds of rosy glory, and I heard brass bands in the distance
playing a familiar air: "See the Conquering Hero comes," it was they were playing.

I felt a tap on my shoulder, and heard a gentle voice say, "Arise, Sir Backsight Forethought;"
but in a trice my dream of bliss was shattered--the gentle voice changed into the well-known
croak of my servant. "Time to pack your kit on the wagon, sir. Corfy's been up some time now,
sir." I was still in stinking old Dreamdorp.
