See in Charlevoix, vol. i. p. 235, the history of the first war which the French inhabitants
of Canada carried on, in 1610, against the Iroquois. The latter, armed with bows and arrows,
offered a desperate resistance to the French and their allies. Charlevoix is not a great painter,
yet he exhibits clearly enough, in this narrative, the contrast between the European manners
and those of savages, as well as the different way in which the two races of men understood
the sense of honor. When the French, says he, seized upon the beaver-skins which covered the
Indians who had fallen, the Hurons, their allies, were greatly offended at this proceeding;
but without hesitation they set to work in their usual manner, inflicting horrid cruelties
upon the prisoners, and devouring one of those who had been killed, which made the Frenchmen
shudder. The barbarians prided themselves upon a scrupulousness which they were surprised at
not finding in our nation, and could not understand that there was less to reprehend in the
stripping of dead bodies than in the devouring of their flesh like wild beasts. Charlevoix,
in another place (vol. i. p. 230), thus describes the first torture of which Champlain was
an eyewitness, and the return of the Hurons into their own village. Having proceeded about
eight leagues, says he, our allies halted; and having singled out one of their captives, they
reproached him with all the cruelties which he had practised upon the warriors of their nation
who had fallen into his hands, and told him that he might expect to be treated in like manner;
adding, that if he had any spirit he would prove it by singing. He immediately chanted forth
his death-song, and then his war-song, and all the songs he knew, "but in a very mournful strain,"
says Champlain, who was not then aware that all savage music has a melancholy character. The
tortures which succeeded, accompanied by all the horrors which we shall mention hereafter,
terrified the French, who made every effort to put a stop to them, but in vain. The following
night, one of the Hurons having dreamt that they were pursued, the retreat was changed to a
real flight, and the savages never stopped until they were out of the reach of danger. The
moment they perceived the cabins of their own village, they cut themselves long sticks, to
which they fastened the scalps which had fallen to their share, and carried them in triumph.
At this sight, the women swam to the canoes, where they received the bloody scalps from the
hands of their husbands, and tied them round their necks. The warriors offered one of these
horrible trophies to Champlain; they also presented him with some bows and arrows--the only
spoils of the Iroquois which they had ventured to seize--entreating him to show them to the
King of France. Champlain lived a whole winter quite alone among these barbarians, without
being under any alarm for his person or property.

Appendix E

Although the Puritanical strictness which presided over the establishment of the English colonies
in America is now much relaxed, remarkable traces of it are still found in their habits and
their laws. In 1792, at the very time when the anti-Christian republic of France began its
ephemeral existence, the legislative body of Massachusetts promulgated the following law, to
compel the citizens to observe the Sabbath. We give the preamble and the principal articles
of this law, which is worthy of the reader's attention: "Whereas," says the legislator, "the
observation of the Sunday is an affair of public interest; inasmuch as it produces a necessary
suspension of labor, leads men to reflect upon the duties of life, and the errors to which
human nature is liable, and provides for the public and private worship of God, the creator
and governor of the universe, and for the performance of such acts of charity as are the ornament
and comfort of Christian societies:--Whereas irreligious or light-minded persons, forgetting
the duties which the Sabbath imposes, and the benefits which these duties confer on society,
are known to profane its sanctity, by following their pleasures or their affairs; this way
of acting being contrary to their own interest as Christians, and calculated to annoy those
who do not follow their example; being also of great injury to society at large, by spreading
a taste for dissipation and dissolute manners; Be it enacted and ordained by the Governor,
Council, and Representatives convened in General Court of Assembly, that all and every person
and persons shall on that day carefully apply themselves to the duties of religion and piety,
that no tradesman or labourer shall exercise his ordinary calling, and that no game or recreation
shall be used on the Lord's Day, upon pain of forfeiting ten shillings.

"That no one shall travel on that day, or any part thereof, under pain of forfeiting twenty
shillings; that no vessel shall leave a harbour of the colony; that no persons shall keep outside
the meeting-house during the time of public worship, or profane the time by playing or talking,
on penalty of five shillings.

"Public-houses shall not entertain any other than strangers or lodgers, under penalty of five
shillings for every person found drinking and abiding therein.

"Any person in health, who, without sufficient reason, shall omit to worship God in public
during three months, shall be condemned to a fine of ten shillings.

"Any person guilty of misbehaviour in a place of public worship, shall be fined from five to
forty shillings.

"These laws are to be enforced by the tything-men of each township, who have authority to visit
public-houses on the Sunday. The innkeeper who shall refuse them admittance, shall be fined
forty shillings for such offence.

"The tything-men are to stop travellers, and require of them their reason for being on the
road on Sunday; anyone refusing to answer, shall be sentenced to pay a fine not exceeding five
pounds sterling. If the reason given by the traveller be not deemed by the tything-man sufficient,
he may bring the traveller before the justice of the peace of the district." (Law of March
8, 1792; General Laws of Massachusetts, vol. i. p. 410.)

On March 11, 1797, a new law increased the amount of fines, half of which was to be given to
the informer. (Same collection, vol. ii. p. 525.) On February 16, 1816, a new law confirmed
these same measures. (Same collection, vol. ii. p. 405.) Similar enactments exist in the laws
of the State of New York, revised in 1827 and 1828. If it take in commerce, although not now has been from

 The best history to consult
concerning Connecticut is that of Benjamin Trumbull, entitled "A Complete History of Connecticut,
Civil and Ecclesiastical," 1630-1764, 2 vols. 8vo, printed in 1818 at New Haven. This history
contains a clear and calm account of all the events which happened in Connecticut during the
period given in the title. The author drew from the best sources, and his narrative bears the
stamp of truth. All that he says of the early days of Connecticut is extremely curious. See
especially the Constitution of 1639, vol. i. ch. vi. p. 100; and also the Penal Laws of Connecticut,
vol. i. ch. vii. p. 123.

"The History of New Hampshire," by Jeremy Belknap, is a work held in merited estimation. It
was printed at Boston in 1792, in 2 vols. 8vo. The third chapter of the first volume is particularly
worthy of attention for the valuable details it affords on the political and religious principles
of the Puritans, on the causes of their emigration, and on their laws. The following curious
quotation is given from a sermon delivered in 1663:--"It concerneth New England always to remember
that they are a plantation religious, not a plantation of trade. The profession of the purity
of doctrine, worship, and discipline, is written upon her forehead. Let merchants, and such
as are increasing cent. per cent., remember this, that worldly gain was not the end and design
of the people of New England, but religion. And if any man among us make religion as twelve,
and the world as thirteen, such an one hath not the spirit of a true New Englishman." Indication is
however the best history attention through these successive spellings,‘ history’ (lydgate), work
than we crevish’ (Pennsylvania), strength we craifish the (Holland),
and the history cray-fish the craw-fish’ of these three belknap details
have bridged over we are at once; and in fact of our french‘ fish
the finding its way into this word than we see even another example of
a law, which has been already be true illustrated in this history
among 283 origin. This abundantly, and are certainly it is not self-evident.
 His is the best account of the famous
confederation of the Iroquois.
