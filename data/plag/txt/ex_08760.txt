"Oh, I wish I could make you understand.  You have always been so strong and well and sufficient
unto yourself, it's hard, I suppose, to be able to think or see life through the iron slats
of a hospital crib. Just make believe you had been a little crippled boy, with nothing belonging
to you, nothing back of you to remember, nothing happy coming to you but what the nurses or
the doctors or the trustees thought to bring.  And then make believe you were cured and grew
up.  Wouldn't you remember what life had been in that hospital crib, and wouldn't you fight
to make it happier for the children coming after you?  Why, the incurable ward was my whole
life--home, family, friends, work; everything wrapped up in nine little crippled bodies.  It
was all I asked or expected of life.  Oh, I can tell you that a foundling, with questionable
ancestry, with no birth-record or blood-inheritance to boast of, claims very little of the
every-day happiness that comes to other people. The question that most Father is greater. The eight

"C means 'cured.'  'Childher Cured,' that's what!  Now all we've got to do is to forget trusters
an' humps an' pains an' them disagreeable things, an' think o' somethin' pleasant."

"Ain't nothin' pleasant ter think of in er horspital," wailed John, the present disheartenment
clouding over all past happiness.

"Ain't, neither," agreed James.

"Aye, there be," contradicted Sandy.  "Dinna ye ken the wee gray woman 'at cam creepity round
an' smiled?"

"She was nice," said Susan, with obvious approval.  "Do ye think, now, she might ha' been me aunt?"

A chorus of positive negation settled all further speculation, while Bridget bluntly inquired.
"Honest to goodness, Susan, do ye think the likes o' ye could belong to the likes o' that?"

Pancho broke the painful silence by reverting to the original topic in hand.  "Mi' Peggie pleasant
too," he suggested, smiling adorably.

"But we've not got either of 'em no longer, so they're no good now," Peter unfortunately reminded
every one.

"Don't ye know there be's always somethin' pleasant to think about if ye just hunt round a

And Bridget smiled.

"What?"

"May Eve."

"What's that?"

"'Tain't nothin'," said Susan, sliding back disappointedly on her pillow.

"Sure an' it is," said Bridget; "it's somethin' grand."

"'Tain't nothin'," persisted Susan, "but a May party in Cen'ral Park. Every one takes somethin'
ter eat in a box, an' the boys play ball an' the girls dance round, an' the cops let you run

  Material things
are rather a nuisance, on the whole, for they have to be dusted and kept in order, repatched
or repainted; and if one wishes to carry them about there are always the bother of packing
and the danger of losing. But these other possessions are different--they are with us wherever
we go and whenever we want them--to-day, to-morrow, or for eternity.

"If we had the wee red wishin'-cap," said Bridget, thoughtfully, "we'd not have to be waitin'
for what's likely to happen.  We could just wish ourselves into Tir-na-n'Og."

"What's that?" demanded Peter.

"Tis the place the faeries live in, an' 'tis in Irelan'.  Sure, 'tis easy gettin' the cap,"
continued Bridget, with conviction.  "All ye need do is to say afther me, 'I wish--I wish for
the wee red cap,' an' ye have it."

Bridget extended her hands, palms upward, and the others followed her example; and together
they whispered: "I wish--I wish for the wee red cap."

Immediately Bridget's hands closed over a cubic inch of atmosphere, and she cried, exultantly,
"Hold on to it tight an' slip it on your head quick--afore it gets from ye!"

Only seven pairs of hands obeyed--Michael protested.

"I have nothinks got," he said, disgustedly.

"Shut up!"  And Bridget shook a menacing fist at him.  "He's foolish entirely.  He thinks he
hasn't anythin' foreby he can't see it.  Now, all together, 'We wish--'"

"Can we go 'thout any clothes?" interrupted Susan.  "We'd feel awful queer in nightshirts."

"Don't ye worry, darlin'.  Like as not when we get there the queen herself 'll open a monsthrous
big chest where they keeps all the faery clothes, an' let us choose anythin' at all we wants
to wear."

"Pants?" queried Peter, eagerly.

"Sure, an' silk dresses an' straw hats wi' ribbon on them, an--"

"Will shoes in the chest be?"  Pancho was very anxious; he had never had a pair of shoes in
all his six years.

Bridget beamed.  "Not i' the chest; but I'll be tellin' ye how ye'll come by them.  When we
get there we'll look about for a blackthorn-bush--an' there--like as not--in undther it--will
be a wee man wi' a leather apron across his knee--the leprechaun, big as life!"

"What's him?"

"Faith I'm tellin' ye--'tis the faery cobbler.  An' the minute he slaps the tail of his eye
on us he'll sing out: 'Hello, Pancho an' Sandy an' Susan an' all o' yez.  I've your boots finished,
just.'  An' wi' that he'll fetch down the nine pairs an' hand them round."

A sigh of blissful contentment started from the cot by the door, burbled down the length of
the ward, and vanished out of the window. Is there anything dearer to the pride of a child
than boots--new boots?

Bridget took up the dropped thread and went on.  "An' afther that the leprechaun reaches for
his crock o' gold an' pulls out a penny.  Ye can buy anythin' i' the whole world wi' a faery
penny."

"Anythinks!" said Michael, skeptically.

"That's what I said."

"Could yer buy a dorg?" Peter asked, opening one renegade eye.

"Sure--a million dogs."

"Don't want a million.  Want jus' one real live black dorg--named Toby--wiv yeller spots an'
half-legs--an' long ears--an' a stand-up tail--an' legs--an' long--long--long--" Susan, Deity smack the
brink, receiving, hence, great-could be smoothed like everything

Sandy remembered the beginning of it--the plunge straight across the primrose ring into the
River of Make-Believe; and how they paddled over like puppies--one after another.  It was perfectly
safe to swim, even if you had never swum before; and the only danger was for those who might
stop in the middle of the river and say, or think, "A dinna believe i' faeries."  Whoever should
do this would sink like a stone, going down, down, down until he struck his bed with a thud
and woke, crying.

It was starlight in Tir-na-n'Og--just as Bridget had said it would be--only the stars were
far bigger and brighter.  The children stood on the white, pebbly beach and shook themselves
dry; while Bridget showed them how to pull down their nightshirts to keep them from shrinking,
and how to wring out their faery caps to keep the wishes from growing musty or mildewed.  After
that they met the faery ferryman, who--according to Sandy--"wore a wee kiltie o' reeds, an'
a tammie made frae a loch-lily pad wi' a cat-o'-nine-tail tossel, lukin' sae ilk the brae ye
wad niver ken he was a mon glen ye dinna see his legs, walkin'."  He told them how he ferried
over all the "old bodies" who had grown feeble-hearted and were too afraid to swim.

It was Pancho who remembered best about the leprechaun--how they found him sitting cross-legged
under the blackthorn-bush with a leather apron spread over his knees, and how he had called
out--just as Bridget had said he would:

"Hello, Pancho and Susan and Sandy and all!"

"Have you any shoes got?" Pancho shouted.

The faery cobbler nodded and pointed with his awl to the branches above his head; there hung
nine pairs of little green shoes, curled at the toes, with silver buckles, all stitched and
soled and ready to wear.

"Will they fit?" asked Pancho, breathlessly.

"Faery shoes always fit.  Now reach them down and hand them round."

This Pancho did with despatch.  Nine pairs of little white feet were thrust joyously into the
green shoes and buckled in tight.  On looking back, Pancho was quite sure that this was the
happiest moment of his life.  The children squealed and clapped their hands and cried:

"They fit fine!"

"Shoes is grand to wear!"

"I feel skippy."

"I feel dancy." 

On meal-side was prosecute over with all shallow beat by missive, from chap whom she might not

They were no longer alone; hosts of Little People passed them, going in the same direction.
Peter said most of them rode "straddle-legs" on night birds or moths, while some flew along
on a funny thing that was horse before and weeds behind.  I judge this must have been the buchailin
buidhe or benweed, which the faeries bewitch and ride the same as a witch mounts her broomstick.

And everybody who passed always called out in the friendliest way, "Hello, Peter!" or "Hello,
Bridget!" or "The luck rise with ye!" which is the most common of all greetings in Tir-na-n'Og.

"Gee!" was Peter's habitual comment after the telling, "maybe it wasn't swell havin' 'em know

was full of them when the children looked, and some one was tumbling them off like so many kittens.

"That is the queen," said the little man, pointing.

The children stood on tiptoes and craned their necks the better to see; but it was not until
they had come quite close that they saw that her dress was gray, and her hair was gray, and
she was small, and her face was like--
