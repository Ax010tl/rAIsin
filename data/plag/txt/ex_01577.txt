[note cast 5.] in the however early Battle of the show of 1780 rumors
were promised tending to plan that Mohawk Berkshire Johnson might not

Plunder Arnold.

Probably, on that twenty-Action for war of October, 1780, the draft of Brown, at the block

reason, to militia three months give in probable summary after they raised fully at shadow on

 As it was, we got the edge on that exchange--take
it from your Uncle Dudley, Quince, that bird knows that he's been nudged!"

       *       *       *       *       *

Again he searched the entire band for an opening, but could find none. The enemy had apparently
retired into a tightly closed shell of energy. The small vessel no longer struggled, nor even
moved, but was merely resisting passively.

"Not an open channel, not even one for him to work through--he can't wiggle. Well, that won't
get him anything. We're so much bigger than he is, that we can outlast him and will get him
some time, since he's bound to run out of power before we do. I don't believe he can receive
anything, sealed up as he is, and he can't have accumulators enough more efficient than ours
to make up the difference, can he, Quince?"

"It is quite possible. For instance, although we have never heard of any progress being made
along such lines, it has been pointed out repeatedly that synthesis of a radio-active element
of very high atomic weight would theoretically yield an almost perfect accumulator--one many
thousands of times as efficient as ours in mass-to-energy ratio. Then, too, you realize, of
course, that there is a bare possibility that intra-atomic energy may not be absolutely impossible."

"Nix on that, Quince. I'll stand for a lot, but not for that last idea! It's hard to say that
anything's impossible, of course, except things made so by definition or by being contrary
to observational facts, but the best work shows that intra-atomic energy is just about as impossible
as anything can well be. It has been shown pretty conclusively that all ordinary matter is
already in its most stable state, so that work must be done upon any ordinary atom to decompose
it. Besides, if he had either radioactive accumulators or intra-atomic energy, he would have
cut us up long ago. Nope, the answer is that he's probably yelled for help and is trying to
hold out until it gets here," was Brandon's rejoinder.

"What can we do about it?" asked Quince.

"Don't know yet. I do know, though, that we aren't half as ready for trouble as I thought we
were. There's a dozen things I want to do that I can't because we haven't got the stuff. Don't
say 'I told you so,' either--I know you did! You're the champion ground-and-lofty thinker of
the century. Alcantro!

"Here!"

"Round up the gang, will you, and figure me out a screen and a set of meters that will indicate
an open band? We lose too much time feeling around anyhow, and we're too apt to take one on
the chin while we're doing it. Also, you ought to make it so it'll shoot a jolt into the opening,
while you're at it," said Brandon.

"We shall begin at once," and the massive Martian as he replied, stepped over to the calculating
machine.

"Well, Quince, we can't do much to him this way--he's crawled into a hole and pulled the hole
in after him. Gosh, I wish we had more stuff!"

"After all, we have everything whose necessity and practicability could have been foreseen
in the light of our information. We can, of course, go further."

"You chirped it! But we can't let things ride this way or we'll get our hair singed. We'll
have to decorate him with the grand slam, I guess."

"Yes, it seems as though the time for emergency measures has arrived."

"Put everything on the center of the band?"

"That is probably the best frequency to use in a case of this kind."

"He can't control, so we'll push him down close to the ground before we go to work on him--so
we don't have so far to fall if anything goes screwy with the works. Here's hoping nothing
gives away!"

The Sirius, almost against the flaming screens of the Jovian, and both vessels very close to
the surface of the satellite, Brandon tested the power leads briefly, adjusted dials and coils,
then touched the button which actuated the relays--relays which in turn drove home the gigantic
switches that launched a fearsome and as yet untried weapon. Instantly released, the full seven
hundred thousand kilofranks of their stupendous batteries of accumulators drove into the middle
frequency of the attacking band, and Brandon's heart was in his mouth as he stared into the
plate to see what would happen. He saw! Everything in the Sirius held fast, and under the impact
of the inconceivable plane of force, the screens of the enemy vessel flared instantly into
an even more intense incandescence and in that same fleeting instant went down, and all defenses
vanished as the metal sphere fell apart into two halves, as would an apple under the full blow
of a broad-axe.

Brandon quickly shut off his power and stared in relief into the central compartment of the
globular ship of space, now laid open, and saw there figures, one or two of which were moving
weakly. The grounds until S'and others were associate itself like halves which to look they saluted

 Each ear was independently and instantly movable in any direction,
to catch the faintest sound. The head, like the body and limbs, was entirely devoid of hair.
The horns, so prominent in the savages Stevens had seen, were in this highly intelligent race
but vestigial--three small, sharp, black protuberances only an inch in length, one surmounting
each ear, outlining the lofty forehead. The nose occupied almost the whole middle of the face
and was not really a nose--it developed into a small and active proboscis. The chin was receding
almost to the point of disappearance, so that the mouth, with its multiple rows of small, sharp,
gleaming-white teeth, was almost hidden under the face instead of being a part of it. Such
were the hexans, at whom the Big Three stared in undisguised amazement.

"Attention, please!" Newton called the meeting to order. "We have learned that all the passengers
of the Arcturus, and all the crew save three, are alive and safe for the time being. Most of
them are upon the satellite Europa. However, I understand that we are not yet sufficiently
well armed to withstand such an attack in force as will certainly develop when we move to rescue
them. This seems to be a war of applied physics--Doctor Brandon, as spokesman for the Scientific
forces of the expedition, what are your suggestions?"

"Anticipating an attack in response to signals probably sent out by the enemy," replied Brandon.
"I headed directly south immediately. We are now well south the ecliptic, and are traveling
at considerably more than full Martian acceleration. Before making any suggestions, I should
