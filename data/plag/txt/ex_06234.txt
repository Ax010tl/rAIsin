Occasionally an infertile and sparsely inhabited littoral bordering a limited zone of singular
productivity, especially if favorably located for international trade, will develop marked
maritime activity, both in trade and commercial colonization. Such was Arabian Yemen, the home
of the ancient Sabæans on the Red Sea, stretching from the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb north-westward
for 500 miles. Here a mountain range, rising to 10,000 feet and bordering the plateau desert
of central Arabia, condenses the vapors of the summer monsoon and creates a long-drawn oasis,
where terraced coffee gardens and orchards blossom in the irrigated soil; but the arid coastal
strip at its feet, harboring a sparse population only along its tricking streams, developed
a series of considerable ports as outlets for the abundant products and crowded population
of the highlands.[479] A location on the busy sea lane leading from the Indian Ocean to the
Mediterranean, near the meeting place of three continents, made the merchants of the Yemen
coast, like the Oman Arabs to the north, middlemen in the trade of Europe with eastern Africa
and India.[480] Therefore, even in the second century these Sabæans had their trading stations
scattered along the east coast of Africa as far south as Zanzibar.[481] In 1502 Vasco da Gama
found Arabs, either of Oman or Yemen, yet farther south in Sofala, the port for the ivory and
gold trade. Some of them he employed as pilots to steer his course to India.[482]

History makes one fact very plain: a people who dwell by the sea, and to whom nature applies
some lash to drive them out upon the deep, command opportunity for practically unlimited expansion.
In this way small and apparently ill-favored strips of the earth's surface have become the
seats of wide maritime supremacy and colonial empire. The scattered but extensive seaboard
possession of little Venice and Genoa in the latter centuries of the Middle Ages are paralleled
in modern times by the large oversea dominions of the English and Dutch.

Seaward expansions of peoples are always of great moment and generally of vast extent, whether
they are the coastward movements of inland peoples to get a foothold upon the great oceanic
highway of trade and civilization, as has been the case with the Russians notably since the
early eighteenth century, and with numerous interior tribes of West Africa since the opening
of the slave trade; or whether they represent the more rapid and extensive coastwise and oversea
expansions of maritime nations like the English, Dutch, and Portuguese. In either event they
give rise to widespread displacements of peoples and a bizarre arrangement of race elements
along the coast. When these two contrary movements meet, the shock of battle follows, as the
recent history of the Russians and Japanese in Manchuria and Korea illustrates, the wars of
Swedes and Russians for the possession of the eastern Baltic littoral, and the numerous minor
conflicts that have occurred in Upper Guinea between European commercial powers and the would-be
trading tribes of the bordering hinterland.

[Sidenote: Ethnic contrast between coast and interior peoples.]

A coast region is a peculiar habitat, inasmuch as it is more or less dominated by the sea.
It is exposed to inundation by tidal wave and to occupation by immigrant fleets. It may be
the base for out-going maritime enterprise or the goal of some oversea movement, the dispenser
or the recipient of colonists. The contrast between coast-dwellers and the nearby inland people
which exists so widely can be traced not only to a difference of environment, but often to
a fundamental difference of race or tribe caused by immigration to accessible shores. The Greeks,
crowded in their narrow peninsula of limited fertility, wove an Hellenic border on the skirts
of the Black Sea and eastern Mediterranean lands, just as the Carthaginians added a fringe
of aliens to North Africa, where the Punic people of the coast presented a marked contrast
to the Berbers of the interior. [See map page 251.]

An ethnographical map of Russia to-day shows a narrow but almost continuous rim of Germans
stretching from the River Niemen north through the Baltic coast of Courland, Livland, and Esthland,
as far as Revel; and again, a similar band of Swedes along the seaboard of Finland, from a
point east of Helsingfors on the south around to Uleaborg on the north,[483] dating from the
time when Finland was a political dependency of Sweden, and influenced by the fact that the
frozen Gulf of Bothnia every winter makes a bridge of ice between the two shores. [See map
page 225.]

[Sidenote: Ethnic contrasts in the Pacific islands.]

Everywhere in the Melanesian archipelago, where Papuans and Malays dwell side by side, the
latter as the new-comers are always found in possession of the coast, while the darker aborigines
have withdrawn into the interior. So in the Philippines, the aboriginal Negritos, pure or more
often mixed with Malayan blood, as in the Mangyan tribe of central Mindoro, are found crowded
back into the interior by the successive invasions of Malays who have encircled the coasts.
[See map page 147.] The Zamboanga peninsula of Mindanao has an inland pagan population of primitive
Malayan race called Subanon, who have been displaced from the littoral by the seafaring Samal
Moros, Mohammedanized Malays from the east shores of Sumatra and the adjacent islands, who
spread northward about 1300 under the energizing impulse of their new religion.[484] Even at
so late a date as the arrival of Magellan, the Subanon seem to have still occupied some points
of the coast,[485] just as the savage Ainos of the Island of Yezo touched the sea about Sapporo
only forty years ago, though they are now surrounded by a seaboard rim of Japanese.[486]

[Sidenote: Ethnic contrasts in the Americas.]

If we turn to South America, we find that warlike Tupi, at the time of the discovery, occupied
the whole Brazilian coast from the southern tropic north to eastern Guiana, while the highlands
of eastern Brazil immediately in their rear were populated by tribes of Ges, who had been displaced
by the coastwise expansion of the Tupi canoemen.[487] [See map page 101.] And to-day this same
belt of coastland has been appropriated by a foreign population of Europeans and Negroes, while
the vast interior of Brazil shows a predominance of native Indian stocks, only broken here
and there by a lonely enclave of Portuguese settlement. The early English and French territories
in America presented this same contrast of coast and inland people--the colonists planting
themselves on the hem of the continent to preserve maritime connection with the home countries,
the aborigines forced back beyond reach of the tide.

Wherever an energetic seafaring people with marked commercial or colonizing bent make a highway
of the deep, they give rise to this distinction of coast and inland people on whatever shores
they touch. The expanding Angles and Saxons did it in the North Sea and the Channel, where
they stretched their litus Saxonicum faintly along the coast of the continent to the apex of
Brittany, and firmly along the hem of England from Southampton Water to the Firth of Forth;[488]
the sea-bred Scandinavians did it farther north in the Teutonic fringe of settlements which
they placed on the shores of Celtic Scotland and Ireland.[489]

[Sidenote: Older ethnic stock in coastlands.]

As a rule it is the new-comers who hold the coast, but occasionally the coast-dwellers represent
the older ethnic stock. In the Balkan Peninsula to-day the descendants of the ancient Hellenes
are, with few exceptions, confined to the coast. The reason is to be found in the fact that
the Slavs and other northern races who have intruded by successive invasions from the plains
of southern Russia are primarily inland peoples, and therefore have occupied the core of the
peninsula, forcing the original Greek population before them to the edge of the sea.[490] This
is the same anthropo-geographical process which makes so many peninsulas the last halting-place
of a dislodged earlier race. But the Greeks who line the northern and western shores of Asiatic
Turkey are such only in language and religion, because their prevailing broad head-form shows
them to be Turks and Armenians in race stock.[491]

Sometimes the distinction of race between coast and interior is obliterated so far as language
and civilization are concerned, but survives less conspicuously in head-form and pigmentation.
The outermost fringe of the Norwegian coast, from the extreme south to the latitude of Trondhjem
in the north, is occupied by a broad-headed, round-faced, rather dark people of only medium
height, who show decided affinities with the Alpine race of Central Europe, and who present
a marked contrast to the tall narrow-headed blondes of pure Teutonic type, constituting the
prevailing population from the inner edge of the coast eastward into Sweden. This brachycephalic,
un-Germanic stock of the Norwegian seaboard seems to represent the last stand made by that
once wide-spread Alpine race, which here has been shoved along to the rocky capes and islands
of the outer edge by a later Teutonic immigration coming from Sweden.[492] So the largest continuous
area of Negrito stock in the Philippines is found in the Sierra Madre mountains defining the
eastern coast of northern Luzon.[493] Facing the neighborless wastes of the Pacific, whence
no new settler could come, turned away from the sources of Malay immigration to the southwest,
its location made it a retreat, rather than a gateway to incoming races. [See map page 147.]

[Sidenote: Ethnic amalgamations in coastlands.]

Where an immigrant population from oversea lands occupies the coastal hem of a country, rarely
do they preserve the purity of their race. Coming at first with marauding or trading intent,
they bring no women with them, but institute their trading stations or colonies by marriage
with the women of the country. The ethnic character of the resultant population depends upon
the proportion of the two constituent elements, the nearness or remoteness of their previous
kinship, and the degree of innate race antagonism. The ancient Greek elements which crossed
the Aegean from different sections of the peninsula to colonize the Ionian coast of Asia Minor
mingled with the native Carian, Cretan, Lydian, Pelasgian, and Phoenician populations which
they found there.[494] On all the barbarian shores where the Greeks established themselves,
there arose a mixed race--in Celtic Massilia, in Libyan Barca, and in Scythian Crimea--but
always a race Hellenized, born interpreters and mercantile agents.[495]

A maritime people, engrossed chiefly with the idea of trade, moves in small groups and intermittently;
hence it modifies the original coastal population less than does a genuine colonizing nation,
especially as it prefers the smallest possible territorial base for its operations. The Arab
element in the coast population of East Africa is strongly represented, but not so strongly
as one might expect after a thousand years of intercourse, because it was scattered in detached
seaboard points, only a few of which were really stable. The native population of Zanzibar
and Pemba and the fringe of coast tribes on the mainland opposite are clearly tinged with Arab
blood. These Swahili, as they are called, are a highly mixed race, as their negro element has
been derived not only from the local coast peoples, but also from the slaves who for centuries
have been halting here on their seaward journey from the interior of Africa.[496] [See map
page 105.]

[Sidenote: Multiplicity of race elements on coasts.]

Coast peoples tend to show something more than the hybridism resulting from the mingling of
two stocks. So soon as the art of navigation developed beyond its initial phase of mere coastwise
travel, and began to strike out across the deep, all coast peoples bordered upon each other,
and the sea became a common waste boundary between. Unlike a land boundary, which is in general
accessible from only two sides and tends to show, therefore, only two constituent elements
in its border population, a sea boundary is accessible from many directions with almost equal
ease; it therefore draws from many lands, and gives its population a variety of ethnic elements
and a cosmopolitan stamp. This, however, is most marked in great seaports, but from them it
penetrates into the surrounding country. The whole southern and eastern coast population of
England, from Cornwall to the Wash, received during Elizabeth's reign valuable accessions of
industrious Flemings and Huguenots, refugees from Catholic persecution in the Netherlands and
France.[497] Our North Atlantic States, whose population is more than half (50.9 per cent.)
made up of aliens and natives born of foreign parents,[498] have drawn these elements from
almost the whole circle of Atlantic shores, from Norway to Argentine and from Argentine to
Newfoundland. Even the Southern States, so long unattractive to immigrants on account of the
low status of labor, show a fringe of various foreign elements along the Gulf coast, the deeper
tint of which on the census maps fades off rapidly toward the interior. The same phenomenon
appears with Asiatic and Australian elements in our Pacific seaboard states.[499] The cosmopolitan
population of New York, with its "Chinatown," its "Little Italy," its Russian and Hungarian
quarters, has its counterpart in the mixed population of Mascat, peopled by Hindu, Arabs, Persians,
Kurds, Afghans, and Baluchis, settled here for purposes of trade; or in the equally mongrel
inhabitants of Aden and Zanzibar, of Marseilles, Constantinople, Alexandria, Port Said, and
other Mediterranean ports.

[Sidenote: Lingua franca of coasts.]

The cosmopolitanism and the commercial activity that characterize so many seaboards are reflected
in the fact that, with rare exceptions, it is the coast regions of the world that give rise
to a lingua franca or lingua geral. The original lingua franca arose on the coast of the Levant
during the period of Italian commercial supremacy there. It consisted of an Italian stock,
on which were grafted Greek, Arabic, and Turkish words, and was the regular language of trade
for French, Spanish, and Italians.[500] It is still spoken in many Mediterranean ports, especially
in Smyrna, and in the early part of the nineteenth century was in use from Madagascar to the
Philippines.[501] From the coastal strip of the Zanzibar Arabs, recently transferred to German
East Africa, the speech of the Swahili has become a means of communication over a great part
of East Africa, from the coast to the Congo and the sources of the Nile. It is a Bantu dialect
permeated with Arabic and Hindu terms, and sparsely sprinkled even with English and German
words.[502] "Pidgin English" (business English) performs the function of a lingua franca in
the ports of China and the Far East. It is a jargon of corrupted English with a slight mixture
of Chinese, Malay, and Portuguese words, arranged according to the Chinese idiom. Another mongrel
English does service on the coast of New Guinea. The "Nigger English" of the West African trade
is a regular dialect among the natives of the Sierra Leone coast. Farther east, along the Upper
Guinea littoral, the Eboe family of tribes who extend across the Niger delta from Lagos to
Old Calabar have furnished a language of trade in one of their dialects.[503] The Tupi speech
of the Brazilian coast Indians, with whom the explorers first came into contact, became, in
the mouth of Portuguese traders and Jesuit missionaries, the lingua geral or medium of communication
between the whites and the various Indian tribes throughout Brazil.[504] The Chinook Indians,
located on our Pacific coast north and south of the Columbia River, have furnished a jargon
of Indian, French, and English words which serves as a language of trade throughout a long
stretch of the northwest Pacific coast, not only between whites and Indians, but also between
Indians of different linguistic stocks.[505]

[Sidenote: Coast-dwellers as middlemen.]

 They buy at low prices the forest and agriculture
products of the inland Malays, whom they do not permit to approach either rivers or seaboard,
for fear they may come into contact with the Chinese merchants along the coast. So fiercely
is their monopoly guarded by this middleman race, that the American Government in the Philippines
will be able to break it only by military interference.[512]

[Sidenote: Differentiation of coast from inland people.]

Differences of occupation, of food supply, and of climate often further operate to differentiate
the coast from the inland people near by, and to emphasize the ethnic difference which is almost
invariably present, either inconspicuously from a slight infusion of alien blood, or plainly
as in an immigrant race. Sometimes the contrast is in physique. In Finisterre province of western
Brittany, the people along the more fertile coastal strip are on the average an inch taller
than the inhabitants of the barren, granitic interior. Their more generous food supply, further
enriched by the abundant fisheries at their doors, would account for this increased stature;
but this must also be attributed in part to intermixture of the local Celts with a tall Teutonic
stock which brushed along these shores, but did not penetrate into the unattractive interior.[513]
So the negroes of the Guinea Coast, though not immune from fevers, are better nourished on
the alluvial lowlands near the abundant fish of the lagoons, and hence are often stronger and
better looking than the plateau interior tribes near by. But here, again, an advantageous blending
of races can not be excluded as a contributing cause.[514] Sometimes the advantage in physique
falls to the inland people, especially in tropical countries when a highland interior is contrasted
with a low coast belt. The wild Igorotes, inhabiting the mountainous interior of northern Luzon,
enjoy a cooler climate than the lowlands, and this has resulted in developing in them a decidedly
better physique and more industrious habits than are found in the civilized people of the coasts
encircling them.[515]

[Sidenote: Early civilization of coasts.]

Where a coast people is an immigrant stock from some remote oversea point, it brings to its
new home a surplus of energy which was perhaps the basis of selection in the exodus from the
mother country. Such a people is therefore characterized by greater initiative, enterprise,
and endurance than the sedentary population which it left behind or that to which it comes;
and these qualities are often further stimulated by the transfer to a new environment rich
in opportunities. Sea-born in their origin, sea-borne in their migration, they cling to the
zone of littoral, because here they find the conditions which they best know how to exploit.
Dwelling on the highway of the ocean, living in easy intercourse with distant countries, which
would have been far more difficult of access by land-travel over territories inhabited by hostile
races, exchanging with these both commodities and ideas, food-stuffs and religions, they become
the children of civilization, and their sun-burned seamen the sturdy apostles of progress.
Therefore it may be laid down as a general proposition, that the coasts of a country are the
first part of it to develop, not an indigenous or local civilization, but a cosmopolitan culture,
which later spreads inland from the seaboard.

[Sidenote: Retarded coastal peoples.]

Exceptions to this rule are found in barren or inaccessible coasts like the Pacific littoral
of Peru and Mexico, and on shores like those of California, western Africa and eastern Luzon,
which occupy an adverse geographic location facing a neighborless expanse of ocean and remote
from the world's earlier foci of civilization. Therefore the descent from the equatorial plateau
of Africa down to the Atlantic littoral means a drop in culture also, because the various elements
of civilization which for ages have uninterruptedly filtered into Sudan from the Mediterranean
and the Red Sea, have rarely penetrated to the western rim of the highland, and hence never
reached the coast. Breakfast.-- an all-fruit of nothing and apples, bananas, ages, and
orange, or have any fruit that is in season.

Of rising.-- the

 They have descended in their flight upon the original coast dwellers, adding to
the general condition of political disruption, multiplying the number of small weak tribes,
increasing the occasions for intertribal wars, and furthering the prevailing degradation. The
seaboard lowlands of Sierra Leone, Liberia and the Ivory Coast have all suffered thus In historic
times.[516] All this region was the original home of the low, typical "Guinea Nigger" of the
Southern plantation. The coasts of Oregon and California showed a parallel to this in their
fragmentary native tribes of retarded development, whose level of culture, low at best, sank
rapidly from the interior toward the seaboard. They seem to have been intruders from the central
highlands, who further deteriorated in their weakness and isolation after reaching the coast.
They bore every mark of degradation in their short stature, linguistic and tribal dismemberment,
their low morals and culture, which ranked them little above the brutes. In contrast, all the
large and superior Indian groups of North America belonged to the interior of the continent.[517]

[Sidenote: Cultural contrast of coast and interior.]

The long, indented coast of the Mediterranean has in all ages up to modern times presented
the contrast of a littoral more advanced in civilization than the inland districts. The only
exception was ancient Egypt before Psammeticus began to exploit his mud-choked seaboard. This
contrast was apparent, not only wherever Phoenicians or Greeks had appropriated the remote
coast of an alien and retarded people, but even in near-by Thrace the savage habits of the
interior tribes were softened only where these dwelt in close proximity to the Ionian colonies
along the coast, a fact as noticeable in the time of Tacitus as in that of Herodotus five hundred
years before.[518] The ancient philosophers of Greece were awake to the deep-rooted differences
between an inland and a maritime city, especially in respect to receptivity of ideas, activity
of intellect, and affinity for culture.[519]

If we turn to the Philippines, we find that 65 per cent. of the Christian or civilized population
of the islands live on or near the coast; and of the remaining 35 per cent. dwelling inland,
by far the greater part represents simply the landward extension of the area of Christian civilization
which had Manila Bay for a nucleus.[520] Otherwise, all the interior districts are occupied
by wild or pagan tribes. Only it may not be added that her first philippines was dwelt of course of
English, which had already occupied her to live through the works of greater Chaucer and Fielding.
Years especially, we read it was again, near systematic districts. Even the Fiji Islands show different shades of savagery between coasts and interior.[521]
