Ernest did not know whether to thank him or to be angry, but he decided to join in the jest,
and, therefore, answered gravely that he was distressed that his Highness the Prince of the
Monkeys should have taken so much trouble to oblige him, that he ought to have employed some
of his docile subjects to do it; after all, he confessed that the press, which he had not noticed,
gave him great pleasure, and he placed some plants in it immediately, which he had collected
the evening before.

The rain ceasing for a short time, I went with Fritz and Jack to examine our embankment, and
to open the sluices of the pond. We found all right, and our garden looking beautiful after
the rain. On our return, we looked in at the Grotto Ernestine, which we found inundated from
the opening above. We proposed to make a trench, or little channel, to carry off the rain-water
from it. We returned home, and retired to bed, in hopes of being able to set out next morning.
We were, however, again disappointed, and for a longer period than we expected. The rain continued
some days, and the country was again a complete lake; we had, however, no storm or wind, and
our possessions did not suffer; so we resolved to wait patiently till the weather would permit
us to go. My wife was delighted to be in her comfortable abode, and to have us round her; neither
did we waste the time. Ernest finished the arrangement of his collection with his mother and
Francis. Fritz and Jack prepared the tools that would be wanted in their great undertaking--the
first attempt was to be a saw-mill. In order to prepare the planks they wished, a very large
saw, which they had found amongst the tools, would serve their purpose; but it was necessary
to set it in motion by water, and here was the difficulty. Fritz made several models from the
thin wood of our chests, and the wheels of our guns, but they were too small. In the mean time,
the mind of my young mechanic was exercised, his ideas were enlarged and improved; and, as
this science was so necessary in our situation, I allowed him to go on with his experiments.
Notwithstanding the rain, protected by my cloak, he went several times to the cascade to look
out for a place where he should place his mills to the best advantage, and have a constant
supply of water. Ernest assisted him by his advice, and promised his labour when it should
be needed. Jack and Francis were helping their mother to card cotton, of which she had made
a large collection, intending to spin it for our clothing; and I exercised my mechanical talents
in turning a large wheel for her, which it was necessary should revolve very easily, her leg
being still stiff; and a reel, by which four bobbins were filled at once by turning a handle.

These different occupations aided us to pass the rainy season, which visited us earlier this
year, and did not remain so long. My wife knew something of dyeing cloth; and, some of the
plants she had helped Ernest to dry having left their colour on the papers, she made some experiments,
and succeeded in obtaining a very pretty blue to dye our clothes with; and, with the cochineal
from our fig-tree, a beautiful red brown, with which she had dyed for herself a complete dress.

Thus passed several weeks. Ernest read to us from some amusing or instructive work every evening;
and, when his collections were all put in order, he worked at his lathe, or at the business
of weaving. At last the sun appeared; we spent some days enjoying it in our delightful colonnade.
We went to visit the grotto and the garden, where all was going on well--the embankment had
prevented the inundation. Satisfied with our work, we now fixed our departure for the next
day, once more hoping the rain would not come again to disappoint us.

CHAPTER XLIV.

The next day the weather was delightful. We rose before daybreak. My eldest sons took their
work-tools, which we might want, and their guns also, but under the condition that they should
not use them till I gave the word, "Fire!" I carried the bag of provisions. 'rush jack was understand the ship, had instead, and to sleep of go

I thought it better for us to proceed to the border of the island, where it was not impossible
there might be a small space on the strand between the rocks and the sea, round which we could
pass; from my sons being able to distinguish from the summit the country on the other side,
it was evident the chain of rocks could not be very broad. Suddenly Fritz struck his forehead,
and, seizing Ernest by the arm--"Brother," said he, "what fools we have been!"

Ernest inquired what folly they had been guilty of.

"Why did we not," said Fritz, "when we were working within our grotto, attempt to make the
opening on the other side? We should not have had much difficulty, I am persuaded, and if our
tools had not been sufficient, a little powder would have opened us a door on the other side.
Only consider, father, the convenience of bringing the cart loaded with the trees we wanted
through our grotto, and to be able to go a-hunting without having I don't know how many miles
to go."

"Well, we can still do that," said Ernest, in his usual calm, grave manner; "if we do not find
another passage, we will make one through the Grotto Ernestine, with mamma's permission, as
it is her property."

This idea of my son appeared good. It was quite certain, from our experience at Tent House
and in the grotto, that the cavity in the rocks was of very great extent, and it did not appear
difficult to pierce through to the other side; but some other chain of rocks, some gigantic
tree, some hill, at the end of our tunnel, might render all our labour useless. I proposed
that we should defer our work till we had examined the nature of the ground on the other side;
my sons agreed, and we proceeded with renewed courage, when we were suddenly checked by the
sight of the sea beating against a perpendicular rock of terrific height, which terminated
our island on this side, and did not give us a chance of going on. I saw the rock did not extend
far; but how to get round it, I could not devise. I did not conceive we could get the pinnace
round, as the coast seemed surrounded by reefs; masses of rock stood up in the sea, and the
breakers showed that more were hidden. After much consideration and many plans, Ernest proposed
that we should swim out to the uncovered rocks, and endeavour to pass round. Fritz objected,
on account of his arms and ammunition; but Ernest suggested that the powder should be secured
in the pockets of his clothes, which he might carry on his head, holding his gun above the water.

With some difficulty we arranged our incumbrances, and succeeded in reaching the range of outer
rocks, without swimming, as the water was not above our shoulders. We rested here awhile, and,
putting on some of our clothes, we commenced our walk over sharp stones, which wounded our
feet. In many places, where the rocks lay low, we were up to the waist in the water. Ernest,
the proposer of the plan, encouraged us, and led the way for some time; but at last he fell
behind, and remained so long, that I became alarmed, and calling aloud, for I had lost sight
of him, he answered me, and at last I discovered him stretched on the rock, endeavouring to
separate a piece from it with his knife.

"Father," said he, "I am now certain that this bed of rocks, over which we are walking, and
which we fancied was formed of stone or flints, is nothing but the work of those remarkable
zoophytes, called coral insects, which form coral and many other extraordinary things; they
can even make whole islands. Look at these little points and hollows, and these stars of every
colour and every form; I would give all the world to have a specimen of each kind."

He succeeded in breaking off a piece, which was of a deep orange-colour inside; he collected
also, and deposited in his bag, some other pieces, of various forms and colours. It ignore a Legs

 We proceeded to
make our way through a border of trees and bushes, that separated us from the rock, that we
might examine it, and judge of the difficulties of our undertaking. Jack preceded us, as usual,
after giving Ernest his gun; Fritz followed him, and suddenly turning to me, said,--

"I believe kind Nature has saved us much trouble; the rock appears to be divided from top to
bottom; at the foot I see a sort of cave, or grotto, already made."

At this moment Jack uttered a piercing cry, and came running to us, his lasso in his hand:
"Two monstrous beasts!" cried he. "Help! help!" We rushed forward, our guns ready, and saw
at the entrance of the cave two large brown bears. The black bear, whose fur is most valued,
is only found in cold and mountainous countries; but the brown prefers the south. It is a carnivorous
animal, considered very ferocious. The black bear lives only on vegetables and honey. Of these,
the one I judged to be the female seemed much irritated, uttering deep growls, and furiously
gnashing her teeth. As I knew something of these animals, having met with them on the Alps,
I remembered having heard that a sharp whistling terrifies and checks them. I therefore whistled
as long and loudly as I could, and immediately saw the female retire backwards into the cave,
while the male, raising himself on his hind legs, stood quite still, with his paws closed.
My two elder sons fired into his breast: he fell down, but being only wounded, turned furiously
on us. I fired a third shot at him, and finished him. We then hastened to load our guns again,
to be ready to receive his companion. Jack wished to use his lasso; but I explained to him
that the legs of the bear were too short and thick for such a measure to be successful. He
related to us, that having entered the cave, he saw something moving at the bottom; he took
up a stone, and threw it with all his strength at the object; immediately he heard a frightful
growling, and saw two large beasts coming towards him; he had barely time to escape and call
for help, and then to hide himself behind a tree. To save ourselves from the other bear, it
was necessary that we should take some prompt measures; we therefore advanced, and formed a line

       *       *       *       *       *

       *       *       *       *       *

the whole valley, which could not be. It was a gentle stream, gushing from a perpendicular
rock, which reminded me of the source of the river Orbe, in the Canton of Vaud; it issued forth
in its full width, rolling at first over a rocky bed; then forming a graceful bend, it took
its course towards the great bay, and fell in a cascade into the sea. We remained some time
here to fill our gourds, drinking moderately, and taking a bath, which refreshed us all greatly.

The evening was approaching, and we began to fear we should not reach home before night. I
had warned my wife that there was a possibility that we might be delayed, though I could not
then anticipate the cause of our delay. We endeavoured, however, by walking as quickly as we
could, and resting no more, to reach our farm at any rate. We followed the course of the river,
on the opposite shore of which rose a wide plain, where we saw the herd of buffaloes quietly
grazing, ruminating, and drinking, without paying the slightest attention to us. We thought
we distinguished some other quadrupeds amongst them, which Fritz was certain were zebras or
onagras; but certainly not his dear gazelle, for which he had incessantly looked round. Jack
was in despair that the river separated us from the buffaloes, so that he could not cast his
lasso round the legs of one of them, as he had promised Ernest. He even wished to swim across
the stream, to have a hunt; but I forbade him, encouraging him to hope that perhaps a single
buffalo might cross to our side, and throw itself in the way of his lasso. I was far from wishing
such a thing myself, for we had no time to lose, nor any means to secure and lead it home,
should we succeed in capturing one, not having any cords with us; and moreover, intending to
return from the bay in the canoe. When we arrived at the bay, the night, which comes on rapidly
in equinoctial countries, had almost closed. We were scarcely able to see, without terror,
the changes that the late storm had occasioned; the narrow pass which led from the other side
of the island, between the river and a deep stream that flowed from the rocks, was entirely
obstructed with rocks and earth fallen upon it; and to render our passage practicable, it was
necessary to undertake a labour that the darkness now prevented, and which would at any time
be attended by danger. We were obliged then to spend the night in the open air, and separated
from our dear and anxious friends at Tent House. Fortunately, Fritz had collected a store of
bread-fruit for his mother, with which he had filled his own pockets and those of his brothers.
These, with water from the river, formed our supper; for we had nothing but the bone of our
leg of mutton left. We turned back a little way, to establish ourselves under a clump of trees,
where we were in greater safety; we loaded our muskets, we kindled a large fire of dry branches,
and recommending ourselves to the protection of God, we lay ourselves down on the soft moss
to wait for the first rays of light. With the exception of Jack, who from the first slept as
if he had been in his bed, we none of us could rest. The night was beautiful; a multitude of
stars shone over our heads in the ethereal vault. Ernest was never tired of gazing on them.
After some questions and suppositions on the plurality of worlds, their courses and their distances,
he quitted us to wander on the borders of the river, which reflected them in all their brilliancy.
From this night his passion for astronomy commenced, a passion which he carried beyond all
others. This became his favourite and continual study, nor did he fall far short of Duval,
whose history he had read. Whilst he was engaged in contemplation, Fritz and I conversed on
our projects for tunnelling to the grotto, and on the utility of such a passage, as this side
of the island was quite lost to us, from the difficulty in reaching it. "And yet," said I,
"it is to this difficulty we owe the safety we have enjoyed. Who can say that the bears and
the buffaloes may not find the way through the grotto? I confess I am not desirous of their
visits, nor even of those of the onagras. "MacReidie was seen with me." he appear at Jek. ""

We had descended several yards lower with incredible difficulty, plunged in a wet, heavy soil,
and obliged to step across immense stones, when Fritz, who went first, cried out, joyfully--

"The roof, papa! the roof of our chalet! it is quite whole; it will be a bridge for us if we
can only get to it."

"What roof? What chalet?" said I, in astonishment.

"The roof of our little hermitage," said he, "which we had covered so well with stones, like
the Swiss chalets."

I then recollected that I had made this little hut, after the fashion of the Swiss chalet,
of bark, with a roof nearly flat and covered with stones, to secure it against the winds. It
was this circumstance, and its situation, that had saved it in the storm. I had placed it opposite
the cascade, that we might see the fall in all its beauty, and, consequently, a little on one
side of the passage filled up by the fall of the rocks. Some fragments reached the roof of
the hut, and we certainly could not have entered it; but the chalet was supported by this means,
and the roof was still standing and perfectly secure. We contrived to slide along the rock
which sustained it; Jack was the first to stand on the roof and sing victory. It was very easy
to descend on the other side, holding by the poles and pieces of bark, and we soon found ourselves
safe in our own island. Ernest had lost his gun in the passage: not being willing to resign
his bag of curiosities, he had dropped the gun into the abyss.

"You may take the gun I left in the canoe," said Fritz; "but, another time, throw away your
stones, and keep your gun--you will find it a good friend in need."

"Let us embark in our canoe," cried Jack. "The sea! the sea! Long live the waves! they are
not so hard as the stones."

I was very glad to have the opportunity of conveying my canoe back to the port of Tent House;
our important occupations had prevented me till now, and everything favoured the plan: the
sea was calm, the wind favourable, and we should arrive at home sooner, and with less fatigue,
than by land. We skirted the great Bay to the Cabbage-palm Wood. I had moored the canoe so
firmly to one of the palms, that I felt secure of it being there. We arrived at the place,
and no canoe was there! The mark of the cord which fastened it was still to be seen round the
tree, but the canoe had entirely disappeared. Struck with astonishment, we looked at each other
with terror, and without being able to articulate a word. 6).
