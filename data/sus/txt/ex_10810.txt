They entered the stately measures of the Spanish dance But the grace of movement which won
the murmuring applause of all around me, only increased the agony of my afflictions.  I saw
their linked arms--the compliant, willing movements of their mutual forms--and dark were the
images of guilt and hateful suspicion which entered my brain and grew to vivid forms, in action
before me. I fancied the fierce, passionate yearnings in the heart of Edgerton; I trembled
when I  conjectured what fancies filled the heart of Julia. I can not linger over the torturing
influence of those moments--moments which seemed ages! "What is it! How do you come here?" said it
hard.

"The cousin let me bleeder screws father!"

"At midnight - He should be able to stay."

I looked at my father, he had knocked down his eyes and stood motionless.

"It left I could not rest, "I said," I was that I was needed here, as I would have to be you.
"

The old man let himself sink into a chair and covered his face with both hands. "Go into your room,"
he murmured, "I want to be alone."

But I did not go. "Let me stay with you," I said softly. My father heard to me, he raised his
head and seemed to listen to outside. Suddenly he jumped up. "Hush!" he cried, "do you hear
it?" and looked at me with eyes wide open.

I stepped to the window and looked out. It was all dead and silent, only the elder branches
proposed to move from the night wind, against each other. "I hear nothing!" I said.

My father was still sleeping when he heard on something that filled
him with horror.

"I said it was no sin, "he said to himself," there is no wickedness
here, and the fountain is, until now at least, on my bottom.

"Then he turned to me."

I white, you do not believe it, my child, "he said," but it is nevertheless
certain, the rod has struck three times, and the news that I have
just too expensive to have to pay to vote all agree, it is a treasure
in our well, which is buried in the Swedish era is.

Why should I not lift it - we have abgedaemmt the source and the water is exhausted, and tonight
we have dug. "

"We?" I asked. "Of what other do you speak?"

"There is only one in town who understands that."

"You do not mean the gold-maker? This is not a good helper!"

"There is nothing ungodly with the tail hitting my child."

"But the drive it is to cheat." - My father had put back on the chair
and looked doubtfully as to himself.

Then he shook his head and said: "The sound spades forward to it, but then something happened
", - and breaking off, he continued:" Eighteen Your mother died, and when they became aware
that they must leave us, they broke in a bitter wines, which seemed
endless, until it fell in their sleep of death.

These were the last sounds I heard from your mother's mouth. "He paused a moment, he said hesitantly
as he shy away from the sound of his voice are: "Tonight, after eighteen years, since the spade
came across the box, I have heard it again. It was not only in my ear, as it is throughout the
years have been so many times, below me, from came the foundations of the earth up there .--
You must not speak with such work, but I felt as sections of the
iron in your dead mother's heart .-- I screamed, went out the lamp,
and - you see, "he continued dull added," so everything is gone.

"

I threw myself in front of my father on his knees and put my hands around his neck. "I'm no
longer a child, "I said," let us stand together, father, I know, this accident is in our house
has come. "

He said nothing, but he rested his damp forehead on my shoulder and it was the first time, that
he was looking at his child a support. How long have we been sitting, I do not know. Because
I felt that my cheeks were moist with tears of hot, from his old eyes flowed. I clung to him.
"Do not cry, father," I asked, "we will also poverty can bear. "

He ran over with his trembling hand my hair and said softly, so softly that I could barely understand:
"The poverty-bye, my child, but not the blame."
And now, my boy, was a bitter hour, but one that even now at my age
I appears to be the most comforting of my life. For the first time
I was my father give the love of his child, and from that moment on
she stopped him the most expensive and soon, the last thing he called
his on earth. While I was sitting next to him and secretly My tears
swallowed, shook me from my father's heart. I now knew that He stood
before the bankruptcy, but that was not the worst. In a sleepless
night, as he searched in vain on his hot pillow for a way out of misery,
he was the half-forgotten legend of the treasure in our fountains
come back to mind. The Thought it had followed since then, the day
when he sat over his books at night, when finally a heavy sleep on
his chest was. In his dreams he had the gold in see dark water burn,
and when he got up in the morning, always had him out to the well-driven,
hinabzustarren to spellbound into the mysterious depths. Were you simple enough to imagine that a woman would be true to her husband, who was
false to her own mother?"

"Fiend!" I muttered in her ear.

"Ha! ha! ha!" was the unmeasured response of the bel dame, loud enough for the whole house
to hear. I darted from her grasp, which would have detained me still, made my way--how I know
not--out of the house, and found myself almost gasping for breath, in the open air of the street.

She, at least, had been sagacious enough to find out my secret

OHAPTEB, XXVII

KINGSLEY.

THE fiendish suggestion of the mother, against the purity of her own child, almost divested
me, for the moment, of my own rancor--almost deprived me of my suspicions! Could anything have
been more thoroughly horrible and atrocious! It certainly betrayed how deep was the malignant
hatred which she had ever borne to myself, and of which her daughter was now required to bear
a portion. What a volume of human depravity was opened on my sight, by that single utterance
of this wretched mother. Guilt and sin! ye are, indeed, the masters everywhere! How universal
is your dominion! How ye rage--how ye riot among souls, and minds, and fancies--never utterly
overthrown anywhere--busy always--everywhere--sovereign in how many hapless regions of the
heart! Who is pure among men? Who can be sure of himself for a day--an hour? Precious few!
None, certainly, who do not distrust their own strength with a humility only to be won from
prayer--prayer coupled with moderate desires, and the presence of a constant thought, which
teaches that time is a mere agent of eternity, and he who works for the one only, will not
even be secure of peace during the period for which he works. Truly, he who lives not for the
future is the very last who may reasonably hope to enjoy the blessings of the present. "Harre, a
moment, "I said and waved him to contact me in the garden.

He looked at me strangely, for my evil message was probably written on my face; I too was when
I had drawn him into a corner of the garden, a good time and had His hand passed without a
word could I produce. But at last I told him everything, and then
I asked him.

"My father wants to go to you, is not too hard on him"

He had become deathly pale, and his eyes came an expression of despair,
perhaps only, of frightened me.

"Wait, Wait, what do you want to start with the old man?"

I cried.

He pressed his hand against his chest. "Nothing, Agnes," he said, as he sad smile looked at, "but
I have to go now from here."

I was frightened .-- "Why?" I asked, stammering.

"I may not be your father again."

"You will forgive him anyway, Wait!"

"Probably, Agnes, and I owe him more than that, but - he is not his
gray head in front of me .

Humiliate And then "- he sat casually yet - add," I also believe it is now with the most will
not. "

I said nothing then, I only saw how the luck, after yesterday I have the hand stretched, faded
into invisible distance, but it was to change anything, it was now on best way it wanted Harre.
I only went on: "When will you go Wait?" I knew hardly even what I said.

"Take care to your father visits me today," he replied, "until tomorrow morning am I finished
with everything I have to do here yet. Offend you and not me, I find easily a shelter. "

After these words we parted, the heart was too full when we could continue to can speak "- the story
teller was silent for a while, then said:".. The next morning saw I did once, and then not more,
the whole long life never again ".

She let her head drop to your chest, the hands that had rested on her lap, wall them around each
other softly, as if to assuage the pain so that, as once the heart The young blond girl, so
still was shaking the frail body of the old woman.

But they did not stay long in this position broken; violently pulling himself, raised them up
from the chair and walked to the window. "What I want to complain!" she said, pointing to the Finger on
the glass, her father's name was. "The man has suffered more than me. Let . Me also tell you yet
"- Harre was gone and he had my father in a warm excellent farewell
letters, they have seen no more.

Soon after, the last legal action against us did, and the opening of bankruptcy should in the near Term
success.

It was then the custom in our city that all public notices do not like now by the preacher in
church, but from the open window of the hall council meeting by the Stadtsekretaer were read
out, but before this happened, was half an hour with the little bell rung from the tower. As our
house was opposite the city hall, then had I so often observed, and also, as under the bell
sound children and idle people before the City Hall windows and gathered on the steps over the Ratskeller.
The same thing happened with the publication of a Konkursurtels,
but people then put the matter a importance among all unit, and the
word "The bell has rung about him," was considered a disgrace I .--
had also belongs in such cases without much thought, now I trembled
at the impression which this operation on the mind make my already
deeply bowed father would. 

He had trusted me that he is determined
to by a fellow councilman to mayor I turned, and the councilman, a
good-natured Schwaetzer had given him assurances that the publication
would happen this time without the bell. But I myself knew from a
safe Source, that this undertaking was a baseless. However, I left
my father in his innocent faith and tried only for him that day to
a short trip to the countryside to discuss with our relatives. But
he wanted, he said with a sad smile, his sinking ship does not leave
from total destruction. Since, in my fear, I remembered one that I
shed in the rear of our very deep and vaulted cellar, the bell Never
did hear beat. I was chosen
out from the beginning for a certain work, in which, my-self a victim, I was to carry out the
designs of destiny in the ease of other victims. I had struggled long not to believe this--not
to do this work. But the struggle was at last at an end.  I was convinced, finally. I was ready
for the work. I was resigned to my fate. But oh! how grateful once had one of these victims
seemed in my eyes! How beautiful, and still how dear was the other!

I rose from my seat and struggle, with the air of one strengthened by thoughtful resolution
for any act. Prayer could not have strengthened me more. I felt a singular degree of strength.
I can well understand that of fanaticism from my own feelings.  Nothing, in the shape of danger,
could have deterred me from the deed. I positively had no remaining fear. But, how was it to
be done? With this inquiry in my mind, still unanswered, I took a light, went into my study,
and drew from my escritoir the few small weapons which I had in possession. These are soon
named. One was a neat little dirk--broad in blade, double-edged, short--sufficient for all
my purposes. I examined my pistols and loaded them--a small, neat pair, the present of Edgerton
himself. This fact determined me not to use them.  I restored them to the escritoir; put the
dagger between the folds of my vest, and prepared to leave the house.

At this moment a heavy knocking was heard at the gate I resumed my seat in the piazza until
the servant should report the nature of the interruption. He was followed in by my friend Kingsley.

"I am glad to find you home," said he abruptly, grasping my hand; "home, and not a-bed. The
hour is late, I know, but the devil never keeps ordinary hours, and men, driven by his satanic
majesty, have some excuse for following his example."

This exordium promised something unusual. The manner of Kingsley betrayed excitement. Nay,
it was soon evident he had been taking a superfluous quantity of wine. His voice was thick,
and he spoke excessively loud in order to be intelligible.  There was something like a defying
desperation in his tones, in the dare-devil swagger of his movement, and the almost iron pressure
of his grasp upon my fingers. 

He nodded.

"And you have whacked Raugraf?"

His lips twitched with a satisfied smile full of hatred. "Well, so they
say, to the best of my knowledge," he said.

The old enemy of high school students said this in such a tone of satisfaction that all my doubts
about the truth vanished.

I could not help but laugh out loud.

"So tell me, tell me the whole story!"

"Well, Philipp - you know that I took Lore, right?â "So, am I to
understand that you two have reached an agreement?"

"Probably," he said .-- "She is a very pleasant person, and, since
her aunt died, she inherited a rather significant amount.

" I smiled back at him. "Well, Christoph, she is otherwise not that bad, you might have a lot of work
up ahead of you, in order to persuade her!

" He took a moment to think.

"I hardly know," he said, "we were standing, waiting in line, Lore and I â anyway, I only went there to
please her â and there was also that tall, pale guy who's always
staring at her, and who had just finished whispering something to
somebody else, and he came and asked her to dance."

"Was his behavior improper towards your lady?" "Outrageous! He doesn't have to do anything, it's
enough to look at his face, such a shameless expression!" "And Lore?"
I said, as my friend's expression turned to anger. "You think she would
have liked to dance with the handsome gentleman?"

The wrinkles on his forehead got deeper, as if a dark cloud suddenly
appeared above his eyes.

"I do not know," he said softly .-- "It's really not proper that
young girls are taught dances at the Latin school from Notknecht."

We shook hands.

"Good-bye, Philipp," he said, "you will receive the money from me shortly, but, other than that, you
probably won't hear from me very often; however, in a few years,
by God's grace, I'll return here, or maybe at my place."

He left.-- I found myself interrupting my work as a vague, but deep concern
about the future of youth games slowly crept into my heart.

I knew only too well that he would remain true
to his words, that his fantasy of that girl was quite satisfied and that all
conceivable forces of intellect would join together to make life
possible, as desired.

Shortly after, I went down to my landlords' apartment,
where I had lunch. It must have been too early, because no member
of the household was there; but in the next room, I met the little
seamstress, the âlame Marieâ, who was busy with the needle alone,
in silence, under a pile of white cloth.

As I had seen her often in the company of the two men, I
told her about yesterday's incident, hoping to learn more details about
its cause.


"You will only lose again. The hope of a gamester rises, in due degree, with the increasing
lightness of his pockets."

"Do not mistake me. I hope nothing from your hundred dollars; indeed, fifty will answer. I
propose to employ it only as a pretext. I expect to lose it, and lose it this very night. 
But it will give me an opportunity to ascertain what I have suspected--too late, indeed, to
save myself--that I have been the victim of false dice and figured cards. You say you will
let me have the money--will you go with me--Will you see me through?"

He extended his hand as he spoke, I grasped it. He shook it with a hearty feeling, while a
bright smile almost, dissipated the cloud from his face.

"You are a man, Clifford; and now, would you believe it, our excellent, immaculate young friend,
Mr. William Edgerton, refused me this money."

"Strange! Edgerton is not selfish--he is not mean! 

emma was usualy always cheery and happy, and had a fun personality, but now as the music roared
she drifted into the garden and felt a strange energy. she surrounded the arms of her william as
he asked her what was wrong, hed never seen her so speechless and occupied. why do you tremble
emma? asked william and she replied have you ever seen a apparition, everything is so different
here in the garden so secret so beautiful. williams wonders how emma comes to such a question
and asks why? emma replies i was sitting across from my dad and it
seemed he had already passed and was deceased, the appearance of a
dead man must be disgraceful. you sadden me emma says william, tell
me how i would appear as a corpse. emma where are you, i feel as hours
have past. did you hear any noises in the area? i want to go back
to the building, these trees seem not right. i didnt hear nothing
but the wind that pushing through the leaves. it was heavy breathing
replied emma a dying man bringing up the leaves! must be god from
heaven!

 I know
I have been the prey of sharpers. That is to say, I have every reason to believe so, and I
have had a hint to that effect. I have a spice of the devil in me, accordingly--a mocking,
mortifying devil, that jeers me with my d---d simplicity; and I propose to go and let the swindlers
know, in a way as little circuitous as possible, that I am not blind to the fact that they
have made an ass of me. There will be some satisfaction, in that. I will write myself down
an ass, for their benefit, only to enjoy the satisfaction of kicking a little like one. I invite
you on a kicking expedition."

I felt for my dagger in my bosom, as I answered: "Very good! Have you weapons?"

"Hickory! You see! a moderate axe-handle, that'll make its sentiments understood You are warned;
you see what you are to expect. I will not take you in. Are you ready for a scratch ?"

"Allons!" I replied indifferently. The truth is, my bosom was full of a recklessness of a far
more sweeping character than his own. I was in the mood for strife. But only under one condition - Friedrich.

Is she? - Knight.

Your beautiful daughter! - Friedrich jumped up, struck angrily with
his hand on the table and looked angrily at the knight.

Then he went with long strides up and down. - At last he stopped, looked again at the Knights long and
significant, and then spoke in a loud, strong voice that trembled at times only by a suppressed
rage, "Go back, Knight! and tells the infamous Manfred that tend to throw my castle in ruins, that
I would rather kill his own hand with my daughter, wants to know in his arms. - A knight, not a murderer,
you should be Gemal; our feud is not finished, can not be ended because it is the duty of every brave
knight to eradicate predators, and a robber is Manfred. - Tell him only, I have not forgotten
how he treacherously murdered the Count von Otter field, such as by him the nobles of LÃ¶wenau
castles and estates are pressed defiance of right, tell him that my sword rests not in the vagina,
but ready was to renew the fight. - Will he stood not believe you,
he may pick up by myself the answer to Blach field in silence on
the knight mounted his horse and galloped away without a glance to
the castle to throw back..

Friedrich was a long up and down until his anger was lost in a friendly
conversation with Conrad of Castle Rock gradually.

* * * * * Had the evening Conrad and Frederick Manfred's already forgotten the mission. The wine was
that in the future, what they dreamed of, saw everywhere only happiness
and joy, and therefore harmless, at ease forgot the sad truth that
every moment could produce a disaster.

       

Emma, ââhowever, was a bow window and looked out into the beautiful area, which illuminated the
moon.

She dreamed in the future over a thousand convenient structure flew
in her mind, in which she always saw himself on the side of her Adalbert.

The air was warm and lovely. A soft noise forests also called the memory of the past back into
her soul. To get this feeling to leave all, she crept slowly on the
balcony of the castle and saw "now with that quiet delight of their
father's corridors down with the lover of the evening glow of the
memories last seen happiness.

"Now floated the moon or just over a distant hill, then he sank slowly, and a pale trembling gloss
over flew again the oak woods, they were serious and dark as, the farthest
western clouds appeared in the passing floating in a pale golden
glow, and soon enveloped the whole area was in darkness, dark and
gruesome as punishes the future, the disaster.



I made some answer, half jest, half earnest, in a mood of mocking bitterness, which, perhaps,
more truly accorded with the temper of both of us. He did not perceive the bitterness, however.

"You jest, but mine is not altogether jest. Half-serious glimpses of what I tell you float
certainly before my eyes.  Such things may happen yet, and the southwest is the world in which
you are yet to see many wondrous things. The time must come when Texas shall stretch to Mexico.
These miserable slaves and reptiles--mongrel Spaniards and mongrel Indians--can not very long
bedevil that great country. It must fall into other hands. It must be ours; and who, when that
time comes, will carry into the field more thorough claims than mine. Master of myself, fearing
nothing, caring for nothing; with a gallant steed that knows my voice, and answers with whinny
and pricked ears to my encouragement; with a rifle that can clip a Mexican--dollar or man--at
a hundred yards, and a heart that can defy the devil over his own dish, and with but one spoon
between us--and who so likely to win his  principality as myself? Then would I assess myself a moment.

LÃ¶wenau was now brawling a hard combat, his goodwill and his love strained tenaciously with each
other, and frequently he would say the dub Adalbert, but the dub died on his lips at the thought of
Emma. - The love was victor. - Would you hate me as a son- Knight?
Friedrich.

You? - If you serious? LÃ¶wenau.

Could you actually trust me now joke? Friedrich.

It is yours, whether it
enjoys you.

LÃ¶wenau. I have been so, perhaps, but
from this moment I go to work! But it was not immediately been willing, but had requested
in particular a significant sum to the necessary preparations for the work. My poor father had
no will left, he gave out, and soon a second and third.he would say the name Adalbert, but the name died on his lips at the thought
of Emma. - The love was victor. - Would you despise me as a son-
Knight?

Friedrich. You? - If you serious?

Löwenau. Could you really trust me now joke?

Friedrich. It is yours,
if it loves you.

Löwenau. I have been so, perhaps, but
from this moment I go to work! But it was not immediately been willing, but had requested
in particular a significant sum to the necessary preparations for the work. My poor father had
no will left, he gave out, and soon a second and third.
