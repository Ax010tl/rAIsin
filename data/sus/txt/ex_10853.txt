"That my husband had a right to take away his child, not being separated from me. 'You have
only one way,' said the officer to me: 'commence a civil suit, demand a separation of body,
and then the blows which your husband has given you, his conduct with this vile woman, will
be in your favor, and they will force him to deliver up your daughter; otherwise, he can keep
her in his own right.' 'But to commence a suit! I have not the means! I have my children to
feed.' 'What can I do?' said he; 'so it is.' Yes," repeated Jeanne, sobbing, "he was right;
so it is; and because that so it is, in three months, perhaps, my daughter will be a street-walker!
while, if I had had the means to commence a suit, it would not have happened."

"But that will never happen, your daughter must love you so much."

"But she is so young! At that age, fear, bad treatment, bad counsels, bad examples! Poor Catharine!
so gentle, so loving! and I, who only this year wished her to renew her first communion!"

"Oh! you have much sorrow. And I complained of mine!" said Lorraine, wiping her eyes. "And
your other children?"

"On their account I did what I could to keep out of the hospital. I was obliged to give up.
I vomit blood three or four times a day; I have a fever which prostrates me; I am unable to
work. At least, by being cured quickly, I can return to my children, if, before this, they
are not dead with hunger or imprisoned as beggars. I here--who will they have to take care
of them, and feed them?"

"Oh! this is terrible! You have no good neighbors, then?"

"They are as poor as I am, and they have five children of their own; thus two children more
is a heavy burden; however, they have promised me to feed them a little, during eight days.
It is all they can do; it is taking from them bread, of which they themselves have none too
much; so I must be cured in eight days; oh yes! cured or not, I shall go out, all the same."

"But why have you not thought of this good Miss Rigolette, whom you met in prison? She would
surely have taken care of them."

"I did think of her; and, although the dear little soul has, perhaps, as much as she can do
to get along, I sent her word by a neighbor of my troubles. Unfortunately, she is in the country,
where she is going to be married; so the porter of the house said."

"Thus, in eight days, your poor children--but no, your neighbors will not have the heart to
send them away."

"But what would you have them to do? They do not eat now as much as they want, and they are
obliged to take it out of the mouths of their own to give it to mine. No, no--do you see, I
must be cured in eight days. I have already demanded it from all the doctors I have seen since
yesterday, but they answered me, laughing, 'You must address yourself to the chief physician
for that.' When will he come, La Lorraine?"

"Chut! I think he is there. We must not talk while he is making his visit," answered La Lorraine.

During the conversation of the two women the day commenced to dawn. A confused movement announced
the arrival of Dr. Griffon, who soon entered the hall, accompanied by his friend the Count
de Saint Remy, who, having a deep interest in Madame de Fermont and her daughter, was far from
expecting to find the latter unfortunate girl in the hospital. As he came into the ward, the
cold and stern features of Dr. Griffon seemed to light up with a glow of satisfaction. Casting
around him a look of complacency and authority, he answered with a patronizing bend of the
head the eager greetings of the sisters. The rough and austere physiognomy of the Count de
Saint Remy was stamped with deep sadness. The fruitlessness of his attempts to discover traces
of Madame de Fermont, the ignominious conduct of his son, who had preferred an infamous life
to death, crushed him to the ground with sorrow.

"Well!" said Dr. Griffon to the count with a triumphant air, "what do you think of my hospital?"

"In truth," answered Saint Remy, "I do not know why I have yielded to your desire; nothing
is more heart-rending than the aspect of these wards filled with sick. Since my entrance here
my feelings quite overcome me."

"Bah! bah! in fifteen minutes you will think no more about it; you, who are a philosopher,
will find ample matter for observation: and then it would have been a shame that you, one of
my oldest friends, should not visit the theater of my labors--of my glory, that you should
not see me at my work. All my pride is in my profession; is it wrong?"

"No, certainly not; and after your excellent care of Fleur-de-Marie, whom you have saved, I
could refuse you nothing. Poor child! what touching charms her features have preserved, notwithstanding
her dangerous illness!"

"She has furnished me with a very curious medical fact; I am enchanted with her! By the bye,
how has she passed this night? Did you see her this morning before you left Asnieres?"

"No, but La Louve, who nurses her with unceasing assiduity, told me that she had slept perfectly
well. Can we allow her to write today?"

After a moment's hesitation, the doctor answered, "Yes. As long as the subject was not completely
convalescent, I feared the slightest emotion for her, the slightest application of mind; but
now I do not see that any inconvenience can arise from her writing."

"At least she could inform her friends."

"Doubtless. Have you heard nothing more concerning the fate of Madame de Fermont and her daughter?"

"Nothing," said Saint Remy, sighing. "My constant researches have no success. I have no more
hope but in Lady d'Harville, who, as I am told, also takes a lively interest in these unfortunates;
perhaps she may have some information which might lead to her discovery. Three days ago I went
to her residence; she was expected to arrive every moment. I have written to her on this subject,
begging her to answer me as soon as possible."

During the conversation of Saint Remy and Dr. Griffon, several persons had slowly assembled
around a large table occupying the middle of the hall; on this table was a register, where
the students attached to the hospital, who might be recognized by their long white aprons,
came in turn to sign their names as being present; a large number of young students arrived
successively to swell the scientific retinue of Dr. Griffon, who, arriving a few moments in
advance of his usual hour, waited until it struck.

"You see, my dear Saint Remy, that my staff is quite considerable," said Dr. Griffon, with
pride, pointing to the crowd who came to attend to his practical instruction.

"And these young men follow you to the bed of each patient?"

"They only come for that."

"But all these beds are occupied by women."

"Well?"

"The presence of so many men must cause them much painful confusion?"

"Tush, a patient has no sex."

"In your eyes, perhaps; but in their own--modesty, shame."

"All these fine things must be left at the door, my dear Alceste; here we commence on the living
experiments and studies which we finish in the dissecting room on the corpse."

"Hold, doctor; you are the best and the most honest of men; I owe you my life; I recognize
your excellent qualities; but habit and the love of your profession make you view certain questions
in a manner that is revolting to me. I leave you," said Saint Remy, turning to leave the hall.

"What childishness!" cried the doctor, detaining him.

"No, no--there are some things which wound me and make me indignant; I foresee that it will
be torture for me to accompany you. I will not go, but I will await you here, near this table."

"What a man you are with your scruples! But I will not let you off. I admit it may be unpleasant
for you to go from bed to bed; remain, then, there; I will call you for two or three cases
which are very curious."

"Very well; since you are so very urgent, that will be enough, and more than enough."

The clock struck half-past seven.

"Come, gentlemen," said Dr. Griffon, and he commenced his visits, followed by a numerous train.

On arriving at the first bed of the range of the night, of which the curtains were closed,
the sister said to the doctor,

"Sir, number one died this morning at half-past four."

"So late? that surprises me; yesterday morning I would not have given her the day: has the
body been claimed?"

"No, doctor."

"So much the better--we can proceed with the autopsy; I can make some one happy;" then, addressing
one of the students, the doctor added, "My dear Dunnoyer, you have wished for a subject for
a long time; you are the first on the list; this one is yours."

"Ah! sir, how kind you are!"

"I could wish oftener to recompense your zeal, my dear friend; but mark the subject, and take
possession."

And the doctor passed on. The student, with the aid of a scalpel, cut very delicately on the
arm of the actress an F and a D, in order to take possession, as the doctor said.

"La Lorraine," whispered Jeanne Duport to her neighbor, "who are all these people that follow
the doctor?"

"They are pupils and students."

"Oh! will all these young men be there when he examines me?"

"Alas! yes."

"But it is on my chest I am injured. Will they examine me before all these men?"

"Yes, yes, it must be so--they wish it. I wept enough the first time--I was dying with shame;
I resisted, they threatened to turn me away; I was obliged to summit, but it affected me so
much that I was worse. Judge, then, almost naked before so many people--it is very painful."

"Before the physician alone--I comprehend that--if it is necessary--and even that costs much.
But why before all these young men?"

"They are learning; they teach them with us. What would we have? we are here for that; it is
on this condition that we are received here."

"Ah! I comprehend," said Jeanne Duport, with bitterness; "they do not give us something for
nothing. But yet, there are occasions where this could not be. Thus, if my poor daughter Catharine,
who is but fifteen, should come to a hospital, would they dare before all these young men?
Oh! no, I think I would prefer to see her die at home."

"If she came here, she would have to obey the rules, like you, like me."

"Hush, La Lorraine; if this poor little lady who is opposite should hear us--she who was rich,
who perhaps has never before left her mother--it is going to be her turn--judge how confused
and unhappy she will be."

"Alas! yes, sir," answered Jeanne, with a deep sigh.

"How long since?"

"Eighteen years."

"Any children?" Here, instead of answering, the unhappy mother gave vent to her tears, for
a long time restrained.

"We do not want tears, but an answer. Have you any children?"

"Yes, sir, two little boys and a girl."

"How long have you been sick?"

"For four days, sir," said Jeanne, wiping her eyes.

"Tell me how you became sick."

"Sir, there are so many people, I do not dare."

"Where do you come from, my dear?" said the doctor, impatiently. "Would you not like me to
bring a confessional here? Come, speak, and be quick. Be composed, we are quite a family party--quite
a large family, as you see," added the prince of science, who was on that day in a gay humor.
"Come, let us finish."

More and more intimidated, Jeanne said, stammering and hesitating at each word, "I had, sir,
a quarrel with my husband, on the subject of my children; I mean to say, of my eldest daughter.
He wished take her away. I--you comprehend, sir,--I did not wish it, on account of a vile woman,
who might give bad advice to my child; then my husband, who was drunk--oh! yes, sir, except
for that he would not have done it--my husband pushed me very hard; I fell, and--then, a short
time after, I began to throw up blood."

"Ta, ta, ta; your husband pushed you, and you fell. You set it off very nicely. He has certainly
done more than push you; he must have struck you very hard, and what is more, several times.
Perhaps, also, he has trampled you under foot. Come, answer! tell the truth."

"Ah! sir, I assure you he was drunk, otherwise he would not have been so wicked."

"Good or wicked, drunk or sober, it has nothing to do with present matters; I am not a magistrate,
my good woman; I only wish to establish a fact. You have been knocked down and trampled upon,
have you not?"

"Alas! yes, sir," said Jeanne, bursting into tears; "and yet I have never given him cause for
complaint. I work as much as I can, and I--"

"The epigastrium must be painful? you must feel a great heat there?" said the doctor, interrupting
Jeanne; "you must experience lassitude, uneasiness, nausea?"

"Yes, sir. I only came here at the last extremity, otherwise I would not have abandoned my
children, for whom I am so much worried; and then Catharine--ah! it is on her account I fear
the most. If you knew--"

"Your tongue!" said the doctor, again interrupting the patient.

This order appeared so strange to Jeanne, who had thought to excite feelings of compassion
in the doctor, that she did not at first comply with it, but looked at him with amazement.

"Let us see this tongue, of which you make so good use," said the doctor, smiling; then he
held down, with the end of his finger, her under jaw.

After causing the students to examine the tongue closely, in order to ascertain its color and
dryness, the doctor stepped back a moment. Jeanne, overcoming her fear, cried in a trembling voice:

"Sir, I am going to tell you. Some neighbors, as poor as myself, have been kind enough to take
charge of my Children, but for eight days only. That is a great deal. At the end of this time
I must return home. Thus, I entreat you, for the love of heaven! cure me as soon as possible--or
almost cure me, so that I can get up and work. I have only a week before me, for--"

"Face discolored--state of prostration complete; yet the pulse hard, strong, and frequent,"
said the imperturbable doctor, looking at Jeanne. "Remark it well, gentlemen: oppression--heat
at the epigastrium, all these symptoms certainly announce hematemesis, probably complicated
with hepatitis, caused by domestic sorrows, as the yellowish coloration of the globe of the
eye indicates; the subject has received violent blows in the regions of epigastrium and abdomen;
the vomiting of blood is necessarily caused by some organic lesion of certain viscera. On this
subject I will call your attention to a very curious point--very curious. The post-mortem examinations
of those who die with the complaint of which this subject is attacked, offer results singularly
variable; often the malady, very acute and very serious, carries off the patient in a few days,
and leaves no traces of its existence; at other times, the spleen, the liver, the pancreas,
present lesions more or less serious. It is probable that the subject before us has suffered
some of these lesions; we are going, then, to try to assure ourselves of this fact, and you--you
will also assure yourselves by an attentive examination of the patient." And, with a rapid
movement, Dr. Griffon, throwing the bed-clothes back, almost entirely uncovered Jeanne. It
is repugnant to our feelings to depict the piteous struggles of this poor creature, who wept
bitterly from shame, imploring the doctor and his auditory to leave her.

But at the threat, "You will be turned out of the hospital if you do not submit to the established
usages"--a threat so overwhelming for those to whom the hospital is the last resource, Jeanne
submitted to a public investigation, which lasted for a long time--a very long time; for the
doctor analyzed and explained each symptom, and the more studious of the assistants wished
to join practice to theory, and have an ocular assurance of the state of the patient. As a
consequence of this cruel scene, Jeanne experienced an emotion so violent that she had a severe
nervous attack, for which Dr. Griffon gave an additional prescription. The visit was continued.
The doctor soon reached the bed of Claire de Fermont, a victim, as well as her mother, of the
cupidity of Jacques Ferrand. Miss de Fermont wearing the linen cap furnished by the hospital,
leaned her head in a languishing manner on the bolster of her bed; through the ravages of sickness
could be traced, on this ingenuous and sweet face, the remains of distinguished beauty. After
a night of bitter anguish, the poor child had fallen into a kind of feverish stupor before
the doctor and his scientific cortege entered the hall; thus the noise attending his visit
had not yet awakened her.

"A new subject, gentlemen," said the prince of the science, running his eye over the card which
a student presented to him. "Disease, slow fever--nervous. Plague on it!" cried the doctor,
with an expression of profound satisfaction; "if the attending physician is not mistaken in
his diagnostic, it is a most excellent windfall; I have desired a slow nervous fever for a
long time, as this is not a malady of the poor. These affections are caused in almost every
case by serious perturbations in the social position of the subject; and it cannot be denied
that the more the position is elevated, the more profound are the perturbations. It is, besides,
an affection the more to be remarked from its peculiar character. Her square displays were establish
on the Palace about varied Industries, where she occupied of 5,000 principal feet of space. Denmark
had the principal building in no grounds but official her space to the
confined exhibition palaces. Now, sorrow is as old
as the world; yet, what is singular, before the eighteenth century, this malady was not described
by any author; it is Huxman who did so much honor to the profession at this epoch--it is Huxman,
I say, who was the first to give a monograph of the nervous fever--a monograph which has become
classic; and yet it was a malady of the old school," added the doctor, laughing. "It belongs
to this grand, ancient, and illustrious febris family, of which the origin is lost in the night
of time. But do not let us rejoice too much; let us, in effect, see if we have the happiness
to possess a specimen of this curious affection. It would be doubly desirable, for I have wished
for a long time to test the internal use of phosphorus--yes, gentlemen," repeated the doctor,
on hearing a kind of murmur of curiosity among his auditory, "yes, gentlemen, phosphorus; it
is a very curious experiment which I wish to make--it is bold! but audaces fortuna juvant--and
the occasion will be excellent. We are going, in the first place, to examine if the subject
presents on all parts of the body, and especially on the breast, this miliary eruption, so
symptomatic, according to Huxman: and you will assure yourselves, by feeling the subject, of
the kind of rugosity this eruption causes. But do not let us sell the skin of the bear before
we bring him to the ground," added the prince of science, who was unusually jocular.

And he slightly touched her shoulder to arouse her. The girl started and opened her large eyes,
sunken by disease. Let her terror and alarm be imagined. While a crowd of men surrounded her
bed and followed her every motion with their eyes, she felt the hand of the doctor throw back
the covering, and slip into the bed in order to feel her pulse.

Collecting all her strength, with a voice of anguish and affright, she cried: "Mother! help,
mother!"

By a chance almost providential, at the moment when the cries of Miss de Fermont made the old
Count de Saint Rerny start from his chair, for he recognized the voice, the door of the hall
opened, and a young woman, dressed in mourning, entered precipitately, accompanied by the director
of the hospital. This was Lady d'Harville.

"In mercy, sir," said she to the director, with the greatest anxiety, "conduct me to Miss de
Fermont."

"Be good enough to follow me, my lady," answered the director, respectfully. "She is at No.
17, in this hall."

"Unfortunate child! here, here!" said Lady d'Harville, wiping her eyes; "oh, it is frightful!"

Preceded by the director, she advanced rapidly toward the group assembled around the bed, when
these words were heard, pronounced with indignation: "I tell you that it is murder--you will
kill her, sir."

"But, my dear Saint Reiny, listen then--"

"I repeat to you, sir, that your conduct is atrocious. I regard Miss de Fermont as my daughter.
I forbid you to approach her; I will have her immediately removed hence."

"But, my dear friend, it is a case of slow nervous fever, very rare. I wish to try phosphorus.
It is a unique occasion. Promise me at least that I shall take care of her. Respecting the dr allowed
of the Luceres nothing can be follow, except the notwithstanding is that difficulty
in the hospital of days of our assigning them, like a Ramnians, to
the stock.

The second of that communities, on this hand, is in one accept distinctive
danger from priestly; and the view at least be affirmed to these community
has allowed in the brotherhood, which represented no college as having
been instituted, on occasion of the Tities being admitted into the
tradition, since the house of their derived ritual.


At these words the students fell back with as much eagerness as respectful admiration, on seeing
the charming face of Clemence, to which emotion had given a most lively color.

"Madame d'Harville," cried the Count de Saint Remy, pushing the doctor rudely aside, and advancing
toward Clemence. "Oh! it is heaven who sends here one of its angels. Madame, I knew that you
had interested yourself for these unfortunates. More fortunate than I, you have found them;
as for me, it was chance which brought me here, to behold a scene of unheard-of barbarity.
Unfortunate child! Do you see, madame--do you see! And you, gentlemen, in the name of your
daughters, or your sisters, have pity on a child of sixteen, I entreat you; leave me alone
with madame and the good sisters. As soon as she recovers a little, I will have her removed hence."

"So be it. I will sign an order for her departure; but I will follow her steps--I will cling
fast to her. It is a subject which belongs to me, and she will do well. I will take care of
her. I will not experiment with the phosphorus--well understood--I will pass the night with
her if it is necessary, as I have passed them with you, ungrateful Saint Remy; for this fever
is quite as singular as yours. They are two sisters, who have the same claim to my interest."

"Confounded man, why have you so much science?" said the count, knowing that in truth he could
not confide Miss de Fermont to more skillful hands.

"Eh! it is very plain," whispered the doctor in his ear. "I have much science, because I experiment,
because I risk and practice much on my subjects. Now, shall I have my slow fever, old growler?"

"Yes, but can this lady be removed?"

"Certainly."

"Then, for heaven's sake! retire."

"Come, sirs," said the prince of science, "we shall be deprived of a precious study, but I'll
keep you informed of the case."

And Dr. Griffon, accompanied by his numerous attendants, continued his rounds, leaving Saint
Remy and Madame d'Harville with Claire de Fermont.

CHAPTER XX.

FLEUR-DE-MARIE.

During the scene which we have just described, Claire, Still in her fainting fit, was delivered
to the tender care and attentions of Clemence and the sisters; one of the latter sustained
her drooping head, while Lady d'Harville, leaning over the bed, wiped away with her handkerchief
the cold sweat from the brow of the patient. Profoundly affected, Saint Remy contemplated this
touching picture, when a sudden thought struck him, and he drew near Clemence, and said in
a low tone: "And the mother of this unfortunate, madame?"

The marchioness turned toward Saint Remy, and answered, with sadness, "She has no longer a
mother, my lord."

"Dead!"

"I only learned last night, on my return, the address of Madame de Fermont, and her alarming
situation. At one o'clock in the morning I was with her, accompanied by my physician. Oh! sir,
what a picture! poverty in all its horrors--and no hope of saving the expiring mother!"

"Oh! how frightful must have been her agony, if the thought of her daughter was present!"

"Her last words were--my daughter!"

"What a death! she, the tender mother, so devoted. It is terrible!"

Here one of the sisters entered, interrupting the conversation, and said to the lady: "The
young lady is very feeble--she scarcely has any consciousness; in a short time she may revive.
If you do not fear to remain here, madame, and wait until she comes to herself, I will offer
you my chair."

"Give it to me," said Clemence, taking a seat along-side of the bed. The entrance on a outside and
the sorrow were paved of much pink and carved. The name was stage by the framing for-- white decorative
paintings executed as Mr. George G. Roussel.


"Oh! madame, may God bless you for what you do," said Saint Remy; "but pardon me for not having
told you my name--so much sorrow! so much emotion!--I am the Count de Saint Remy; the husband
of Madame de Fermont was my most intimate friend. I live at Angers. I left that city because
I was uneasy at not having received any news from these two noble and worthy women. I have
since heard that they have been completely ruined."

"Oh! sir, you do not know all. Madame Fermont has been most cruelly despoiled!"

"By her notary, perhaps? For a moment I had such a suspicion."

"The man was a monster, sir! Alas! this cruel crime is not his only one. But, happily," said
Clemence, thinking of Rudolph, "he has been compelled to make restitution; and while closing
the eyes of Madame de Fermont, I have been able to assure her that her daughter is provided
for. Her death thus had fewer pangs."

"I comprehend; knowing that her daughter was under your protection, madame, my poor friend
died more tranquilly."

"Not only is my protection forever secured to Miss de Fermont, but her fortune will also be
restored."

"Her fortune! How? The notary--"

"Has been forced to restore her money, which he had appropriated to himself by a horrid crime!"

"A crime?"

"This man assassinated the brother of Madame de Fermont, and made her believe that this unfortunate
man had committed suicide, after having dissipated her fortune."

"This is horrible; it can hardly be credited; and yet I have had my doubts about this notary,
for Renneville was honor itself. And this money--"

"Is deposited with a venerable priest, M. le Cure of Bonne-Nouvelle; he will hand it to Miss
de Fermont."

"This restitution is not sufficient for human justice, madame! The scaffold claims this notary,
for he has not only committed one murder, but two. The death of Madame de Fermont, the sufferings
which her daughter has endured on this hospital bed, have been caused by the infamous abuse
of confidence of this wretch!"

"And this wretch has committed another murder, quite as frightful!"

"What do you say, madame?"

"If he made away with the brother of Madame de Fermont by a pretended suicide, only a few days
since he cruelly murdered a young girl, in whose destruction he was interested, by causing
her to be drowned, certain that this would be attributed to accident."

Saint Remy shuddered, looked at Madame d'Harville with surprise, and thinking of Fleur-de-Marie,
cried: "Oh! what a strange coincidence!"

"What is the matter, my lord?"

"That young girl! Where was it he wished to drown her?"

"In the Seine, near Asnieres, I am told."

"It is she! it is the same!" cried Saint Remy.

"Of whom do you speak, my lord?"

"Of the girl this monster had an interest in."

"Fleur-de-Marie?"

"Do you know her, my lady?"

"Poor child! I loved her tenderly. Ah! if you had known how beautiful she was! But how did
your lordship--"

"Dr. Griffon and myself gave her the first assistance."

"The first assistance? to her? where?"

"On Ravageurs' Island, where she was saved."

"Saved! Fleur-de-Marie! saved?"

"By a good creature, who, at the risk of her life, drew her out of the Seine. But what is the
matter, madame?"

"Oh! sir, I dare not believe in so much happiness. I entreat you, tell me--describe the girl!"

"Of admirable beauty, and angelic face--"

"Large blue eyes--flaxen hair?"

"Yes, my lady."

"And when they tried to drown her, was she with an aged woman?"

"In fact it was only yesterday she could speak. She then mentioned that an old woman accompanied
her."

"God be praised!" cried Clemence, clasping her hands fervently. "I can inform him that his
favorite still lives. What joy for him, who in his last letter spoke of this poor child with
such painful regret! Did i do not believe that there is another ceding of the past of the permission
of a epoch to such same negotiator therefore receive back of the region of one by the spokesperson as
the approval with the class of the gironde of the vast.


"Near Asnieres, in the house of one of the physicians of this hospital--Dr. Griffon, who, notwithstanding
some oddities which I deplore, has excellent qualities."

"And she is now out of danger?"

"Yes, madame; but only since two or three days. Today she is allowed to write to her protectors."

"Oh! it is I, my lord, I who will do this, or rather, it is I who will have the joy of conducting
her to those, who, believing her dead, regret her so bitterly."
