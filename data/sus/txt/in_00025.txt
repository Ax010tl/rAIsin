CHAPTER I.

ABSCONDED.

Late as it was, though the handsome office-clock on the chimney-piece had already struck eleven,
Roland Sefton did not move. He had not stirred hand or foot for a long while now; no more than
if he had been bound fast by many strong cords, which no effort could break or untie. His confidential
clerk had left him two hours ago, and the undisturbed stillness of night had surrounded him
ever since he had listened to his retreating footsteps. "Poor Acton!" he had said half aloud,
and with a heavy sigh.

As he sat there, his clasped hands resting on his desk and his face hidden on them, all his
life seemed to unfold itself before him; not in painful memories of the past only, but in terrified
prevision of the black future.

How dear his native town was to him! He had always loved it from his very babyhood. The wide
old streets, with ancient houses still standing here and there, rising or falling in gentle
slopes, and called by quaint old names such as he never heard elsewhere; the fine old churches
crowning the hills, and lifting up delicate tall spires, visible a score of miles away; the
grammar school where he had spent the happiest days of his boyhood; the rapid river, brown
and swirling, which swept past the town, and came back again as if it could not leave it; the
ancient bridges spanning it, and the sharp-cornered recesses on them where he had spent many
an idle hour, watching the boats row in and out under the arches; he saw every familiar nook
and corner of his native town vividly and suddenly, as if he caught glimpses of them by the
capricious play of lightning.

And this pleasant home of his; these walls which inclosed his birth-place, and the birth-place
of his children! He could not imagine himself finding true rest and a peaceful shelter elsewhere.
The spacious old rooms, with brown wainscoted walls and carved ceilings; the tall and narrow
windows, with deep window-sills, where as a child he had so often knelt, gazing out on the
wide green landscape and the far distant, almost level line of the horizon. His boy, Felix,
had knelt in one of them a few hours ago, looking out with grave childish eyes on the sunset.
The broad, shallow steps of the oaken staircase, trodden so many years by the feet of all who
were dearest to him; the quiet chambers above where his mother, his wife, and his children
were at this moment sleeping peacefully. How unutterably and painfully sweet all his home was
to him!

Very prosperous his life had been; hardly overshadowed by a single cloud. His father, who had
been the third partner in the oldest bank in Riversborough, had lived until he was old enough
to step into his place. The bank had been established in the last century, and was looked upon
as being as safe as the Bank of England. The second partner was dead; and the eldest, Mr. Clifford,
had left everything in his hands for the last five years.

No man in Riversborough had led a more prosperous life than he had. His wife was from one of
the county families; without fortune, indeed, but with all the advantages of high connections,
which lifted him above the rank of mere business men, and admitted him into society hitherto
closed even to the head partner in the old bank; in spite even of the fact that he still occupied
the fine old house adjoining the bank premises. There was scarcely a townsman who was held
to be his equal; not one who was considered his superior. Though he was little over thirty
yet, he was at the head of all municipal affairs. He had already held the office of mayor for
one year, and might have been re-elected, if his wife had not somewhat scorned the homely bourgeois
dignity. There was no more popular man in the whole town than he was.

But he had been building on the sands, and the storm was rising. He could hear the moan of
the winds growing louder, and the rush of the on-coming floods drawing nearer. He must make
good his escape now, or never. If he put off flight till to-morrow, he would be crushed with
the falling of his house.

He lifted himself up heavily, and looked round the room. It was his private office, at the
back of the bank, handsomely furnished as a bank parlor should be. Over the fire-place hung
the portrait of old Clifford, the senior partner, faithfully painted by a local artist, who
had not attempted to soften the hard, stern face, and the fixed stare of the cold blue eyes,
which seemed fastened pitilessly upon him. He had never seen the likeness before as he saw
it now. Would such a man overlook a fault, or have any mercy for an offender? Never! He turned
away from it, feeling cold and sick at heart; and with a heavy, and very bitter sigh he locked
the door upon the room where he had spent so large a portion of his life. The place which had
known him would know him no more.

As noiselessly and warily as if he was a thief breaking into the quiet house, he stole up the
dimly-lighted staircase, and paused for a minute or two before a door, listening intently. At all times people pass. All, all, through the night, you hearing
about the passing and even understand what they say. Believe you, this is a part of this. Our main
room sits at the street level. With everything so close at hand ... Under the carnage, the grocery
side, a few steps to the fish market, in the square a pharmacy, confectionery, chocolate mill, house
maid, silk shop, drugstore, finally, to say all ... We canât complain. We are in a place so
central, you just have to walk to go to this or that party. We live near the Palace, near the the
Ministry of State, near Bringas office, near the Chapel Royal, near Stables, near the Armory, near
the Plaza de Oriente ... near you, the Fish, my cousin Augustine
â¦ At the time of appoint this person rang the doorbell and someone
entered the house.

"Is he,â said Bringas, âbut he has been in step by step â so
close â that you do not feel it." âIt was understood that visit,â
Rosalie said, laughing, â-and neither will you get three shots in
the room.

It's so weird ...â It is difficult is to set the social scale in
the house occupied by Bringas Amparo - the Amparo - Amparo, Ms. Amparo.

In these four ways she was named. He was at that point confuse all the
same by the friendly relations with which he could not say if he
felt subjugated by a sweet friend or a despotic love of favor.

The obligations of this young man in the house were many and the
cost of affection as assessed as a race which of course can be secured
with who came there in poor relation and annoyance.

This is the most distant relationship known, and should state that
the blood, among families and Sanchez Emperor PipaÃ³n, was of those
who take no more running than a greyhound.

Amparo's mother was CalderÃ³n as the mother of Rosalie, but very remote branches, whose junction
had been found (If a vacant upon) in a hunter's Palace that happened to service Vallabriga and the
infant D. Luis. Bringas had little intercourse with Sanchez the Emperor, but the father had once
received Rosalia in invaluable service for which she was with constant gratitude. Shortly before
his death, D called the unfortunate janitor of the Francisco School of Pharmacy and said:
"All my savings I have spent my illness. Do not let my poor daughters more than thirty days of funds for
the month. If you promise me to do for them everything you can, I
die in peace.

" Bringas, a kind-hearted man, promised to protect them as modest as passing and fulfilled his
promise. They then gave land to his father, InstalÃ¡ronse, the orphans in the smaller house
and cheaper than found, and made a vow of heroism; that the vow was
called forth in order to seek a living from their work.

The single women - single and honored as a patent but in a perpetual fast - those well-bred girls
had faith, and the first disappointment was not discouraged. Too bad they had happened without the
apparent protection of Bringas, and more or less disguised by other
friends SÃ¡nchez and relatives of the Emperor.

The social position of the Barca PipaÃ³n RosalÃ­a de Bringas was not, despite his contact with
families, of the Palace. She was calculated to encourage her aristocratic pretensions high-flying,
but had a cheesy orgullete that often inspired him with cupping nose
and declamatory evocations of merit and quality so notable of their
ancestors.

She also liked to name titles, describe palaces, and express expensive uniforms of good relations.
In a society like this or that and for variation in sixteen years
that had been very great in this society, I say, not invigorated
by work, and which have more value than elsewhere kin, recommendations,
cronyism and friends, the initiative individual is replaced by faith
in relationships.

The well-connected expect everything of the relatives who flatter or the chieftain to whom they serve,
and rarely expect from themselves anything. While they want in this life luxury, Mrs. Bringas did not yield to
any born or unborn child or relative. From that solid foundation dating back to the loftiness
of his orgullete Spanish, which service is the foundation of the
spirit inveterate laziness, idleness of many generations and the lack
of intellectual and moral education.

If that company before 68 differed somewhat from ours and the difference was that it was more
fussy and more lymphatic than was even more vain and lazy, and that was more highly serious and political
changes and empleomania, was a company that moved all of half a dozen bad destinations paid and certain
contempt hinted to the stupid not figure in the high payroll of the State or the Palace - even
were the lowest wallow.


"Good-night, of course," he replied, bending over her and kissing her tenderly.

"God bless you, my son," she said, putting both her hands upon his head, and pressing his face
close to her own. He could not break away from her fond embrace; but in a few moments she let
him go, bidding him get some rest before the night was passed.

Once more he stood in the dimly-lighted passage, listening at his wife's door, with his fingers
involuntarily clasping the handle. But he dared not go in. If he looked upon Felicita again
he could not leave her, even to escape from ruin and disgrace. An agony of love and of terror
took possession of him. Never to see her again was horrible; but to see her shrink from him
as a base and dishonest man, his name an infamy to her, would be worse than death. Did she
love him enough to forgive a sin committed chiefly for her sake? In the depths of his own soul
the answer was no.

He stole down stairs again, and passed out by a side door into the streets. It was raining
heavily, and the wind was moaning through the deserted thoroughfares, where no sound of footsteps
could be heard. Behind him lay his pleasant home, never so precious as at this moment. He looked
up at the windows, the two faintly lit up, and that other darkened window of the chamber he
had not dared to enter. In a few hours those women, so unutterably dear to him, would be overwhelmed
by the great sorrow he had prepared for them; those children would become the inheritors of
his sin. He looked back longingly and despairingly, as if there only was life for him; and
then hurrying on swiftly he lost sight of the old home, and felt as a drowning wretch at sea
feels when the heaving billows hide from him the glimmering light of the beacon, which, however,
can offer no harbor of refuge to him.

CHAPTER II.

PHEBE MARLOWE.

Though the night had been stormy, the sun rose brightly on the rain-washed streets, and the
roofs and walls stood out with a peculiar clearness, and with a more vivid color than usual,
against the deep blue of the sky. It was May-day, and most hearts were stirred with a pleasant
feeling as of a holiday; not altogether a common day, though the shops were all open, and business
was going on as usual. The old be-thought themselves of the days when they had gone a-Maying;
and the young felt less disposed to work, and were inclined to wander out in search of May-flowers
in the green meadows, or along the sunny banks of the river, which surrounded the town. Early,
very early considering the ten miles she had ridden on her rough hill-pony, came a young country
girl across one of the ancient bridges, with a large market-basket on her arm, brimful of golden
May-flowers, set off well by their own glossy leaves, and by the dark blue of her dress. She
checked her pony and lingered for a few minutes, looking over the parapet at the swift rushing
of the current through the narrow arches. A thin line of alders grew along the margin of the
river, with their pale green leaves half unfolded; and in the midst of the swirling waters,
parting them into two streams, lay a narrow islet on which tall willow wands were springing,
with soft, white buds on every rod, and glistening in the sunshine. Not far away a lofty avenue
of lime-trees stretched along the banks, casting wavering shadows on the brown river; while
beyond it, on the summit of one of the hills on which the town was built, there rose the spires
of two churches built close together, with the gilded crosses on their tapering points glittering
more brightly than anything else in the joyous light. For a little while the girl gazed dreamily
at the landscape, her color coming and going quickly, and then with a deep-drawn sigh of delight
she roused herself and her pony, and passed on into the town.

The church clocks struck nine as she turned into Whitefriars Road, the street where the old
bank of Riversborough stood. The houses on each side of the broad and quiet street were handsome,
old-fashioned dwelling-places, not one of which had as yet been turned into a shop. The most
eminent lawyers and doctors lived in it; and there was more than one frontage which displayed
a hatchment, left to grow faded and discolored long after the year of mourning was ended. Here
too was the judge's residence, set apart for his occupation during the assizes. But the old
bank was the most handsome and most ancient of all those urban mansions. It had originally
stood alone on the brow of the hill overlooking the river and the Whitefriars Abbey. Toward
the street, when Ronald Sefton's forefathers had realized a fortune by banking, now a hundred
years ago, there had been a new frontage built to it, with the massive red brick workmanship
and tall narrow windows of the eighteenth century. But on the river side it was still an old
Elizabethan mansion, with gabled roofs standing boldly up against the sky; and low broad casements,
latticed and filled with lozenge-shaped panes; and half-timber walls, with black beams fashioned
into many forms: and with one story jutting out beyond that below, until the attic window under
the gable seemed to hang in mid-air, without visible support, over the garden sloping down
a steep bank to the river-side.

Phebe Marlowe, in her coarse dark blue merino dress, and with her market-basket of golden blossoms
on her arm, walked with a quick step along the quiet street, having left her pony at a stable
near the entrance to the town. There were few persons about; but those whom she met she looked
at with a pleasant, shy, slight smile on her face, as if she almost claimed acquaintance with
them, and was ready, even wishful, to bid them good-morning on a day so fine and bright. Two
or three responded to this inarticulate greeting, and then her lips parted gladly, and her
voice, clear though low, answered them with a sweet good-humor that had something at once peculiar
and pathetic in it. She passed under a broad archway at one side of the bank offices, leading
to the house entrance, and to the sloping garden beyond. A private door into the bank was ajar,
and a dark, sombre face was peering out of it into the semi-darkness. Phebe's feet paused for
an instant.

"Good-morning, Mr. Acton," she said, with a little rustic courtesy. Cienfuegos extended the roadway from the Mount, south to the Arsenal; still, it
is considered a part of Broad Street. The new Prado dates back to the original plans drawn up
by Don Luis de las Casas.

The Count of Santa Clara finished the first phase of house-building. He went on to create another
development further north (usually referred to as Neptune Prado), with the Lions at the far end.
Water comes from the ditch that crosses the Botanical Garden station of the railway that goes from
Havana to Guiness. The trench discharges at the bottom of the Harbor, next to the Arsenal.

A sombre place in gloomy weather, yet so decorated with old china vases, and great brass salvers,
and silver cups and tankards catching every ray of light, that the whole room glistened in
this bright May-day. In the broad cushioned seat formed by the sill of the oriel window, which
was almost as large as a room itself, there sat the elder Mrs. Sefton, Roland Sefton's foreign
mother, with his two children standing before her. They had their hands clasped behind them,
and their faces were turned toward her with the grave earnestness children's faces often wear.
She was giving them their daily Bible lesson, and she held up her small brown hand as a signal
to Phebe to keep silence, and to wait a moment until the lesson was ended.

"And so," she said, "those who know the will of God, and do not keep it, will be beaten with
many stripes. Remember that, my little Felix."

"I shall always try to do it," answered the boy solemnly. "I'm nine years old to-day; and when
I'm a man I'm going to be a pastor, like your father, grandmamma; my great-grandfather, you
know, in the Jura. Tell us how he used to go about the snow mountains seeing his poor people,
and how he met with wolves sometimes, and was never frightened."

"Ah! my little children," she answered, "you have had a good father, and a good grandfather,
and a good great-grandfather. How very good you ought to be."

"We will," cried both the children, clinging round her as she rose from her chair, until they
caught sight of Phebe standing in the doorway. 

Upon entering the first of the above-named characters, put his hand familiarly on the Leonardo
shoulder, called him by that name, and you treated him for you. They had been classmates Philosophy
in the College of San Carlos from 1827 to 1828, in whose last O'Reilly had left to go to Spain
and continue his studies until he received a lawyer, as received, making the patriotic dollars
just a few months before the day that we are speaking, with the use of Mayor. After two years away,
this was the first time who were, having had no occasion or mood Leonardo went to greet him,
perhaps because, While former classmates, he had not stopped being a member of a family the
proudest Havana, the first greatness of Spain. On the other hand, broke single and married again
a Madrid, a source of more to their tastes and interests were very different now than they were
when they were attending together to hear the eloquent philosopher friendly lessons Francisco
Javier de la Cruz.

The occasion of that influx of gentlemen and their servants was none other than the table dance
to be held in the evening the same day, at the top of the palace in the street San Ignacio at
the corner of Teniente Rey, hired for their duties by the Philharmonic Society in 1828. Since the days
of Carnival, in late February, when the celebrations coincided public through the marriage
of the Princess of Naples, María Cristina Fernando VII Spain, the Company aforesaid had not
reopened their classrooms. Now it was as to dismiss the year 1830, it is known that the main
people of Havana, only to right to attend to his duties, he left the camp since early December
and no returned to the city until long after Reyes. On the eve of the soiree, youth both sexes
flocked to stores to fashion and new costumes made new ornaments, jewelry and gloves.


"All men die," he went on, "and it is a pleasant thing to lie down quietly in one's own grave,
where the wicked cease from troubling, and the weary are at rest. He could rest soundly in
the grave."

"I will go and see," cried Madame, catching Phebe by the arm.

"Pray God you may find him dead," he answered, with a low, miserable laugh, ending in a sob.
He was mad; neither Madame nor Phebe had a doubt of it. They put the children before them,
and bade them run away to the nursery, while they followed up the broad old staircase. Madame
went into her son's bedroom; but in a few seconds she returned to Phebe with an anxious face.

"He is not there," she said, "nor Felicita. She is in her own sitting-room, where she likes
not to be followed. It is her sacred place, and I go there never, Phebe."

"But she knows where Mr. Sefton is," answered Phebe, "and we must ask her. We cannot leave
poor Mr. Acton alone. If nobody else dare disturb her, I will."

"She will not be vexed with you," said Madame Sefton. "Knock at this door, Phebe; knock till
she answers. I am miserable about my son."

Several times Phebe knocked, more loudly each time, until at last a low voice, sounding far
away, bade them go in. Very quietly, as if indeed they were stepping into some holy place barefooted,
they crossed the threshold.

CHAPTER III.

FELICITA.

The room was a small one, with a dim, many-colored light pervading it; for the upper part of
the mullioned casement was filled with painted glass, and even the panes of the lower part
were of faintly tinted green. Like all the rest of the old house, the walls were wainscoted,
but here there was no piece of china or silver to sparkle; the only glitter was that of the
gilding on the handsomely bound books arranged in two bookcases. In this green gloom sat Felicita
Sefton, leaning back in her chair, with her head resting languidly on the cushions, and her
dark eyes turned dimly and dreamily toward the quietly opening door.

"Phebe Marlowe!" she said, her eyes brightening a little, as the fresh, sweet face of the young
country girl met her gaze. Phebe stepped softly forward into the dim room, and laid the finest
of the golden flowers she had gathered that morning upon Felicita's lap. It brought a gleam
of spring sunshine into the gloom which caught Felicita's eye, and she uttered a low cry of
delight as she took it up in her small, delicate hand. Phebe stooped down shyly and kissed
the small hand, her face all aglow with smiles and blushes.

"Felicita," said Madame, her voice altering a little, "where is my son this morning?"

"Roland!" she repeated absently; "Roland? Didn't he say last night he was going to London?"

"To London!" exclaimed his mother.

"Yes," she answered, "he bade me good-by last night; I remember now. He said he would not disturb
me again; he was going by the mail-train. He was sorry to be away on poor little Felix's birthday.
I recollect quite distinctly now."

"He said not one word to me," said Madame. "It is strange."

"Very strange," asserted Felicita languidly, as if she were wandering away again into the reverie
they had broken in upon.

"Did he say when he would be back?" asked his mother.

"In a few days, of course," she answered.

"But he has not told Acton," resumed Madame.

"Who did you say?" inquired Felicita.

"The head clerk, the manager when Roland is away," she said. "He has not said anything to him."

"Very strange," said Felicita again. It was plainly irksome to her to be disturbed by questions
like these, and she was withdrawing herself into the remote and unapproachable distance where
no one could follow her. Her finely-chiselled features and colorless skin gave her a singular
resemblance to marble; and they might almost as well have addressed themselves to a marble image.

"Come," said Madame, "we must see Acton again."

They found him in the bank parlor, where Roland was usually to be met with at this hour. There
was an unspoken hope in their hearts that he would be there, and so deliver them from the undefined
trouble and terror they were suffering. But only Acton was there, seated at Roland's desk,
and turning over the papers in it with a rapid and reckless hand. His face was hidden behind
the great flap of the desk, and though he glanced over it for an instant as the door opened
he concealed himself again, as if feigning unconsciousness of any one's presence. If you choose the Monji, I don't
think we need to bother The Lady, who receives tired pretensions and memorials every day.
The poor girl is sad because she is not able to help everybody. Do you know who can give you
the dowry? Nothing crosses your mind?

"I knew it," he exclaimed. "Oh, my dear young master! God grant he may get away safe. All is lost!"

"What do you mean?" cried Madame, forgetting one terror in another, and catching him by the
arm; "what is lost?"
