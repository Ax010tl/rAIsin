Though the desert and steppe have bred conquerors, they are the last parts of the earth's surface
to yield to conquest from without. The untameable spirit of freedom in the shepherd tribes
finds an ally against aggression in the trackless sands, meager water and food supply of their
wilderness. Pursuit of the retreating tribesmen is dangerous and often futile. They need only
to burn off the pasture and fill up or pollute the water-holes to cripple the transportation
and commissariat of the invading army. This is the way the Damaras have fought the German subjugation
of Southwest Africa.[1109] Moreover, the paucity of economic and political possibilities in
deserts and grasslands discourages conquest. Conquest pays only where it is a police measure
to check depredations on the bordering agricultural lands, or where such barren areas are transit
lands to a desirable territory beyond. It is chiefly the "Gates of Herat" and the lure of India
which have drawn Russian dominion across the scorched plains of Turkestan. Tart fields, BELGRAVIA,

 More recently "dry farming"
and scientific agriculture adapted to semi-arid conditions have "pushed the desert off the

pastures to the western border of the state.

Pastoral nomadism has been gradually dislodged from Europe, except in the salt steppes of the
Caspian depression, where a vast tract, 300,000 square miles in area and wholly unfit for agriculture,
still harbors a sparse population of Asiatic Kalmuck and Kirghis hordes, leading the life of
the Asiatic steppes.[1115] In Asia, too, the regions of pastoral nomadism have been curtailed,
but in Africa they still maintain for the most part the growing, expanding geographical forms
which they once showed in Europe, when nomadism prevailed as far as the Alps and the Rhine.
In Africa shepherd tribes cover not only the natural grasslands, but lap over into many districts
destined by nature for agriculture. Hence it is safe to predict that a conspicuous part of
the future economic and cultural history of the Dark Continent will consist in the release
of agricultural regions from nomad occupancy and dominion.

[Sidenote: Supplementary agriculture of pastoral nomads.]

Though agriculture is regarded with contempt and aversion by pastoral nomads and is resorted
to for a livelihood only when they lose their herds by a pest or robbery, or find their pasture
lands seriously curtailed, nevertheless nomadism yields such a precarious and monotonous subsistence
that it is not infrequently combined with a primitive, shifting tillage. The Kalmucks of the
Russian steppes employ men to harvest hay for the winter feeding. The Nogai Tartars practice
a little haphazard tillage on the alluvial hem of the steppe streams.[1116] Certain Arab tribes
living east of the Atbara and Gash Rivers resort with their herds during the dry season to
the fruitful region of Cassala, which is inundated by the drainage streams from Abyssinia,
and there they cultivate dourra and other grains.[1117] The Bechuana tribes inhabiting the
rich, streamless grassland of the so-called Kalahari Desert rear small herds of goats and cultivate
melons and pumpkins; among the other Bechuana tribes on the eastern margin of the desert, the
men hunt, herd the cattle and milk the cows, while the women raise dourra, maize, pumpkins,
melons, cucumbers and beans.[1118] [Compare maps pages 105, 487.]

Such supplementary agriculture usually shifts with the nomad group. But where high mountains
border rainless tracts, their piedmont districts regularly develop permanent cultivation. Here
periodic rains or melting snows on the ranges fill the drainage streams, whose inundation often
converts their alluvial banks into ready-made fields. The reliability of the water supply anchors
here the winter villages of the nomads, which become centers of a limited agriculture, while
the pasture lands beyond the irrigated strips support his flocks and herds. Where the piedmont
of the Kuen Lun Mountains draws a zone of vegetation around the southern rim of the Takla Makan
Desert, Mongol shepherds raise some wheat, maize and melons as an adjunct to their cattle and
sheep; but their tillage is often rendered intermittent by the salinity of the irrigating streams.[1119]
Along the base of the Tian Shan Mountains, the felt yurt of the Gobi nomad gives place to Turki
houses with wheat and rice fields, and orchards of various fruits; so that the whole piedmont
highway from Hami to Yarkand presents an alternation of desert and oasis settlement.[1120]
Even the heart of arid Arabia shows fertile oases under cultivation where the lofty Nejd Plateau,
with its rain-gathering peaks over five thousand feet high, varies its wide pastures with well
tilled valleys abounding in grain fields and date-palm groves.[1121] Along the whole Saharan
slope of the Atlas piedmont a series of parallel wadis and, farther out in the desert, a zone
of artesian wells, sunk to the underground bed of hidden drainage streams from the same range,
form oases which are the seat of permanent agriculture and more or less settled populations.
The Saharan highlands of Tibesti, whose mountains rise to 8,300 feet, condense a little rain
and permit the Tibbus to raise some grain and dates in the narrow valleys.[1122]

[Sidenote: Irrigation and horticulture.]

The few and limited spots where the desert or steppe affords water for cultivation require
artificial irrigation, the importation of plants, and careful tillage, to make the limited
area support even a small social group. Hence they could have been utilized by man only after
he had made considerable progress in civilization.[1123] Oasis agriculture is predominantly
intensive. Gardens and orchards tend to prevail over field tillage. The restricted soil and
water must be forced to yield their utmost. While on the rainy or northern slope of the Atlas
in Algiers and Tunis farms abound, on the Saharan piedmont are chiefly plantations of vegetables,
orchards and palm groves.[1124] In Fezzan at the oasis of Ghat, Barth found kitchen gardens
of considerable extent, large palm groves, but limited fields of grain, all raised by irrigation;
and in the flat hollow basin forming the oasis of Murzuk, he found also fig and peach trees,
vegetables, besides fields of wheat and barley cultivated with much labor.[1125] In northern
Fezzan, where the mountains back of Tripoli provide a supply of water, saffron and olive trees
are the staple articles of tillage. The slopes are terraced and irrigated, laid out in orchards
of figs, pomegranates, almonds and grapes, while fields of wheat and barley border the lower
courses of the wadis.[1126] In the "cup oases" or depressions of the Sahara, the village is
always built on the slope, because the alluvial soil in the basin is too precious to be used
for house sites.[1127]

[Sidenote: Effect of diminishing water supply.]

The water supply in deserts and steppes, on which permanent agriculture depends, is so scant
that even a slight diminution causes the area of tillage to shrink. Here a fluctuation of snowfall
or rainfall that in a moist region would be negligible, has conspicuous or even tragic results.
English engineers who examined the utilization of the Afghan streams for irrigation reported
that the natives had exploited their water supply to the last drop; that irrigation converted
the Kabul River and the Heri-rud at certain seasons of the year into dry channels.[1128] In
the Turkoman steppes it has been observed that expanding tillage, by the multiplication of
irrigation canals, increased the loss of water by evaporation, and hence diminished the supply.
Facts like these reveal the narrow margin between food and famine, which makes the uncertain
basis of life for the steppe agriculturist. Even slight desiccation contracts the volume and
shortens the course of interior drainage streams; therefore it narrows the piedmont zone of
vegetation and the hem of tillage along the river banks. The previous frontier of field and
garden is marked by abandoned hamlets and sand-buried cities, like those which border the dry
beds of the shrunken Khotan rivers of the Tarim basin.[1129] The steppe regions in the New
World as well as the Old show great numbers of these ruins. Barth found them in the northern
Sahara, dating from Roman days.[1130] They occur in such numbers in the Syrian Desert, in the
Sistan of Persia, in Baluchistan, the Gobi, Takla Makan Desert, Turfan and the Lop Nor basin,
that they indicate a marked but irregular desiccation of central and western Asia during the
historical period.[1131]

[Sidenote: Scant diet of nomads.]

If a scant water supply places sedentary agriculture in arid lands upon an insecure basis,
it makes the nomad's sources of subsistence even more precarious. It keeps him persistently
on low rations, while the drought that burns his pastures and dries up well and wadi brings
him face to face with famine. The daily food of the Bedouin is meal cooked in sour camel's
milk, to which bread and meat are added only when guests arrive. His moderation in eating is
so great that one meal of a European would suffice for six Arabs.[1132] The daily food of the
shepherd agriculturists on the Kuen Lun margin of the Takla Makan Desert is bread and milk;
meat is indulged in only three or four times a month.[1133] The Tartars, even in their days
of widest conquest, showed the same habitual frugality. "Their victuals are all things that
may be eaten, for we saw some of them eat lice." The flesh of all animals dying a natural death
is used as food; in summer it is sun-dried for winter use, because at that time the Tartars
live exclusively on mare's milk which is then abundant. A cup or two of milk in the morning
suffices till evening, when each man has a little meat. One ram serves as a meal for fifty
or a hundred men. Bones are gnawed till they are burnished, "so that no whit of their food
may come to naught." Genghis Khan enacted that neither blood nor entrails nor any other part
of a beast which might be eaten should be thrown away.[1134] Scarcity of food among the Tibetan
and Mongolian nomads is reflected in their habit of removing every particle of meat from the
bone when eating.[1135] A thin decoction of hot tea, butter and flour is their staple food.
Many Turkoman nomads, despite outward appearance of wealth, eat only dried fish, and get bread
only once a month, while for the poor wheat is prohibited on account of its cost.[1136] The
Saharan Tibbus, usually on a starvation diet, eat the skin and powdered bones of their dead
animals.[1137]

The privations and hardships of life in the deserts and steppes discourage obesity. The Koko-Nor
Mongols of the high Tibetan plateau are of slight build, never fat.[1138] The Bedouin's physical
ideal of a man is spare, sinewy, energetic and vigorous, "lean-sided and thin," as the Arab
poet expresses it.[1139] The nomadic tribesmen throughout the Sahara, whether of Hamitic, Semitic
or Negro race, show this type, and retain it even after several generations of settlement in
the river valleys of the Sudan. The Bushmen, who inhabit the Kalahari Desert, have thin wiry
forms and are capable of great exertion and privations.[1140]

[Sidenote: Checks to population.]

Though the conquering propensities of nomadic tribes make large families desirable, in order
to increase the military strength of the horde, and though shepherd folk acquiring new and
rich pastures develop patriarchal families, as did the Jews after the conquest of Canaan, nevertheless
the limited water and food supply of desert and grassland, as well as the relatively low-grade
economy of pastoral life, impose an iron-bound restriction upon population, so that as a matter
of fact patriarchal families are rare. When natural increase finds no vent in emigration and
dispersal, marriage among nomads becomes less fruitful.[1141] Artificial limitation of population
occurs frequently among desert-dwellers. In the Libyan oasis of Farafeah, the inhabitants never
exceed eighty males, a limit fixed by a certain Sheik Murzuk.[1142] Poverty of food supply
explains the small number of children in the typical Turkoman family. Among the Koko-Nor Tibetans,
monogamy is the rule, polygamy the exception and confined to the few rich, while families never
include more than two or three children.[1143] According to Burckhardt, three children constitute
a large family among the Bedouins, much to the regret of the Bedouins themselves. Mohammedans
though they are, few practice polygamy, while polyandry and female infanticide existed in heathen
times.[1144] Desert peoples seem to be naturally monogamous.[1145]

[Sidenote: Trade of nomads.]

The prevailing poverty, monotony and unreliability of subsistence in desert and steppe, as
well as the low industrial status, necessitate trade with bordering agricultural lands. The
Bedouins of Arabia buy flour, barley for horse feed, coffee and clothing, paying for them largely
with butter and male colts. The northern tribes resort every year to the confines of Syria,
when they are visited by pedlers from Damascus and Aleppo.[1146] The tribes from Hasa and the
Nejd pasture land bring horses, cattle and sheep to the city of Koweit at the head of the Persian
Gulf to barter for dates, clothing and firearms; and large encampments of them are always to
be seen near this town.[1147] Arabia and the Desert of Kedar sold lambs, rams and goats to
the markets of ancient Tyre.[1148] The pastoral tribes of ancient Judea in times of scarcity
went to Egypt for grain, which they purchased either with money or cattle. The picture of Jacob's
sons returning from Egypt to Canaan with their long lines of asses laden with sacks of corn
is typical for pastoral nomads; so is their ultimate settlement, owing to protracted famine,
in the delta land of Goshen. Umph! He'letter anglaise a first-category.

 Among the Bedouins, blacksmiths and saddlers are the only professional
artisans; these are regarded with contempt and are never of Bedouin stock.[1157] In the ancient
world, industry reached its zero point in Arabia, and in modern times shows meager development
there. On the other hand the Saharan Arabs developed an hereditary guild of expert well-makers,
which seems to date back to remote times, and is held in universal honor.[1158]

[Sidenote: Oriental rugs.]

It is to the tent-dwellers of the world, however, that we apparently owe the oriental rug.
This triumph of the weaver's art seems to have originated among pastoral nomads, who developed
it in working up the wool and hair of their sheep, goats and camels; but it early became localized
as a specialized industry in the towns and villages of irrigated districts on the borders of
the grazing lands, where the nomads had advanced to sedentary life. Therefore in the period
of the Caliphate, from 632 to 1258, we find these brilliant flowers of the loom, blooming like
the Persian gardens, in Persian Farsistan, Khusistan, Kirman and Khorasan. We find them spreading
the mediæval fame of Shiraz, Tun, Meshed, Amul, Bukhara and Merv. The secret of this preeminence
lay partly in the weaver's inherited aptitude and artistic sense for this textile work, derived
from countless generations of shepherd ancestors; partly in their proximity to the finest raw
materials, whose quality was equalled nowhere else, because it depended upon the character
of the pasturage, probably also upon the climatic conditions affecting directly the flocks
and herds.[1159]

A map showing the geographical distribution of Eastern rug-making reveals the relation of the
industry to semi-arid or saline pastures, and makes the mind revert at once to the blankets
of artistic design and color, woven by the Navajo Indians of our own rainless Southwest. Rug
weaving in the Old World reached its finest development in countries like Persia, Turkestan,
western Afghanistan, Baluchistan, western India and the plateau portions of Asia Minor, countries
where the rainfall varies from 10 to 20 inches or even less, [See map page 484.] where nomadism
claims a considerable part of the population, and where the ancestry of all traces back to
some of the great shepherd races, like Turkomans and Tartars. These peoples are hereditary
specialists in the care, classification, and preparation of wools.[1160] Weavers of rugs form
an industrial class in the cities of Persia and Asia Minor, where they obey largely the taste
of the outside world in regard to design and color;[1161] whereas the nomads, weaving for their
own use, adhere strictly to native colors and designs. Their patterns are tribal property,
each differing from that of the other; and though less artistic than those of the urban workers,
are nevertheless interesting and consistent, while the nomad's intuitive sense of color is
fine.[1162]

[Sidenote: Architecture of nomad conquerors.]

The principles of design and color which these tent-dwellers had developed in their weaving,
they applied, after their conquest of agricultural lands, to stone and produced the mosaic,
to architecture and produced the Alhambra and the Taj Mahal.[1163] Whether Saracens of Spain
or Turkoman conquerors of India, they were ornamentists whose contribution to architecture
was decoration. Working in marble, stone, metals or wood, they wrought always in the spirit
of color and textile design, rather than in the spirit of form. The walls of their mosques,
palaces and tombs reproduce the beauty of the rugs once screening the doors of their felt tents.
The gift of color they passed on to the West, first through the Moors of Sicily and Spain,
later through Venetian commerce. Their influence can be seen in the exquisite mosaic decoration
in the cloister of Mont Reale of once Saracenic Palermo, and in the Ducal Palace and St. Mark's
Cathedral of beauty-loving Venice.[1164] This has been almost their sole contribution to the
art of the world.

Pastoral nomads can give political union to civilized peoples; they can assimilate and spread
ready-made elements of civilization, but to originate or develop them they are powerless. Between
the art, philosophy and literature of China on the one side, and of the settled districts of
Persia on the other, lies the cultural sterility of the Central Asia plateau. Its outpouring
hordes have only in part acquired the civilization of the superior agricultural peoples whom
they have conquered; from Kazan and Constantinople to Delhi, from Delhi to Peking they have
added almost nothing to the local culture.

[Sidenote: Arid lands as areas of arrested development.]

Deserts and steppes lay an arresting hand on progress. Their tribes do not develop; neither
do they grow old. They are the eternal children of the world. Genuine nomadic peoples show
no alteration in their manners, customs or mode of life from millennium to millennium. The
interior of the Arabian desert reveals the same social and economic status,[1165] whether we
take the descriptions of Moses or Mohammed or Burckhardt or more recent travelers. The Bedouins
of the Nubian steppes adhere strictly to all their ancient customs, and reproduce to-day the
pastoral nomadism of Abraham and Jacob.[1166] Genealogies were not more important to the biblical
house of David and stem of Jesse than they are for the modern Kirghis tribesman, who as a little
child learns to recite the list of his ancestors back to the seventh generation. The account
which Herodotus gives of the nomads of the Russian steppes agrees in minute details with that
of Strabo written five centuries later,[1167] with that of William de Rubruquis in 1253, and
with modern descriptions of Kalmuck and Kirghis life. The Gauchos or Indian pastoral halfbreeds
of the Argentine plains were found by Wappäus in 1870 to accord accurately with Avara's description
of them at the end of the eighteenth century.[1168] The restless tenants of the grasslands
come and go, but their type never materially changes. Their culture is stationary amid persistent
movement. Only when here or there in some small and favored spot they are forced to make the
transition to agriculture, or when they learn by long and close association with sedentary
nations the lesson of drudgery and progress, do the laws of social and economic development
begin to operate in them. As a rule, they must first escape partly or wholly the environment
of their pasture lands, either by emigration or by the intrusion into their midst of alien
tillers of the soil.

But while the migrant shepherd originates nothing, he plays an historical rôle as a transmitter
of civilization. Asiatic nomads have sparsely disseminated the culture of China, Persia, Egypt
and Yemen over large areas of the world. The Semite shepherds of the Red Sea deserts, through
their merchants and conquerors, long gave to the dark Sudan the only light of civilization
which it received, Mohammed, a Bedouin of the Ishmaelite tribe, caravan leader on the desert
highways between Mecca and Syria, borrowed from Jerusalem the simple tenets of a monotheistic
religion, and spread them through his militant followers over a large part of Africa and Asia.

[Sidenote: Mental and moral qualities of nomads.]

The deserts and grasslands breed in their sons certain qualities and characteristics-courage,
hardihood, the stiff-necked pride of the freeman, vigilance, wariness, sense of locality,[1169]
keen powers of observation stimulated by the monotonous, featureless environment, and the consequent
capacity to grasp every detail.[1170] Though robbery abroad is honorable and marauder a term
with which to crown a hero, theft at home is summarily dealt with among most nomads. The property
of the unlocked tent and the far-ranging herd must be safeguarded.[1171] The Tartars maintained
a high standard of honesty among themselves and punished theft with death.[1172] Wide dispersal
in small groups is reflected in the diversity of dialects among desert peoples;[1173] in the
practice of hospitality, whether among Bedouins of the Nejd, Kirghis of the Central Asia plateau,[1174]
or semi-nomadic Boers of South Africa;[1175] in the persistence of feuds and of the duty of
blood revenge, which is sanctioned by the Koran.

Isolation tends to breed among nomads pride of race and a repugnance to intermixture. The ideal
of the pastoral Israelites was a pure ethnic stock, protected by stern inhibition of intermarriage
with other tribes. Therefore, Moses enjoined upon them the duty of exterminating the peoples
of Canaan whom they dispossessed.[1176] While the urban Arabs show a medley of breeds, dashed
with a strain of negro blood, among the nomad Bedouins, mixture is exceptional and is regarded
as a disgrace.[1177] The same thing is true among the nomad Arabs of Algeria, and there it
has placed a stumbling block in the way of the French colonial administration, by preventing
the appearance of half-breeds who might bridge the gap between the colonials and natives. Where
pastoral Semites have settled in agricultural lands, intermixture on a wide scale has followed,
as in the Sudan from Niger to Nile; but even here, when a tribe or clan has retained a strictly
pastoral life in the grassland, and has held itself aloof from the agricultural districts of
the Negro villages, relatively pure survivals are to be found, as among the Cow or Bush Fulani
of Bornu.[1178] On the other hand, the Hausa, a migrant trading folk of mingled Arab and Negro
blood, spread northward along the trans-Saharan caravan route to the oasis of Air before the
fourteenth century, and there have infused into the local Berber stock a strong Negro strain.[1179]
Among the nomads of Central Asia, one wave of race movement has so often followed and overtaken
another, that it has produced a confused blending of breeds. The mixtures are so numerous that
pure types are exceptional,[1180] and the exclusiveness of the desert Semites disappears.

[Sidenote: Religion of pastoral nomads.]

Though all these desert-born characteristics and customs have a certain interest for the sociologist,
they possess only minor importance in comparison with the religious spirit of pastoral nomads,
which is always fraught with far-reaching historical results. The evidence of history shows
us that there is such a thing as a desert-born genius for religion. Huc and Gabin testify to
the deeper religious feeling of the Buddhist nomads of the Central Asia plateaus, as compared
with the lowland Chinese. (1156) everything arrive to the male who is expect upon.

air stimulates the faculties of the desert-dweller, but the featureless, monotonous surroundings
furnish them with little to work upon. The mind, finding scant material for sustained logical
deduction, falls back upon contemplation. Intellectual activity is therefore restricted, narrow,
unproductive; while the imagination is unfettered but also unfed. First and last, these shepherd
folk receive from the immense monotony of their environment the impression of unity.[1182]
Therefore all of them, upon outgrowing their primitive fetish and nature worship, gravitate
inevitably into monotheism. Their religion is in accord with their whole mental make-up; it
is a growth, a natural efflorescence. Therefore it is strong. Its tenets form the warp of all
their intellectual fabrics, permeate their meager science and philosophy, animate their more
glorious poetry. It has moreover the fanaticism and intolerance characterizing men of few ideas
and restricted outlook upon life. Therewith is bound up a spirit of propaganda. The victories
of the Jews in Palestine, Syria and Philistia were the victories of Jehovah; the conquests
of Saladin were the conquests of Allah; and the domain of the Caliphate was the dominion of Islam.
