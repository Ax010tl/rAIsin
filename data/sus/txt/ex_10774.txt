               HISTORY OF THE THIRTY YEARS' WAR IN GERMANY.

                               BOOK IV.

The weak bond of union, by which Gustavus Adolphus contrived to hold together the Protestant
members of the empire, was dissolved by his death: the allies were now again at liberty, and
their alliance, to last, must be formed anew.  By the former event, if unremedied, they would
lose all the advantages they had gained at the cost of so much bloodshed, and expose themselves
to the inevitable danger of becoming one after the other the prey of an enemy, whom, by their
union alone, they had been able to oppose and to master.  Neither Sweden, nor any of the states
of the empire, was singly a match with the Emperor and the League; and, by seeking a peace
under the present state of things, they would necessarily be obliged to receive laws from the
enemy.  Union was, therefore, equally indispensable, either for concluding a peace or continuing
the war.  But a peace, sought under the present circumstances, could not fail to be disadvantageous
to the allied powers.  With the death of Gustavus Adolphus, the enemy had formed new hopes;
and however gloomy might be the situation of his affairs after the battle of Lutzen, still
the death of his dreaded rival was an event too disastrous to the allies, and too favourable
for the Emperor, not to justify him in entertaining the most brilliant expectations, and not
to encourage him to the prosecution of the war.  Its inevitable consequence, for the moment
at least, must be want of union among the allies, and what might not the Emperor and the League
gain from such a division of their enemies?  He was not likely to sacrifice such prospects,
as the present turn of affairs held out to him, for any peace, not highly beneficial to himself;
and such a peace the allies would not be disposed to accept.  They naturally determined, therefore,
to continue the war, and for this purpose, the maintenance of the existing union was acknowledged
to be indispensable.

But how was this union to be renewed? and whence were to be derived the necessary means for
continuing the war?  It was not the power of Sweden, but the talents and personal influence
of its late king, which had given him so overwhelming an influence in Germany, so great a command
over the minds of men; and even he had innumerable difficulties to overcome, before he could
establish among the states even a weak and wavering alliance.  With his death vanished all,
which his personal qualities alone had rendered practicable; and the mutual obligation of the
states seemed to cease with the hopes on which it had been founded.  Several impatiently threw
off the yoke which had always been irksome; others hastened to seize the helm which they had
unwillingly seen in the hands of Gustavus, but which, during his lifetime, they did not dare
to dispute with him.  Some were tempted, by the seductive promises of the Emperor, to abandon
the alliance; others, oppressed by the heavy burdens of a fourteen years' war, longed for the
repose of peace, upon any conditions, however ruinous.  The generals of the army, partly German
princes, acknowledged no common head, and no one would stoop to receive orders from another.
Unanimity vanished alike from the cabinet and the field, and their common weal was threatened
with ruin, by the spirit of disunion.

Gustavus had left no male heir to the crown of Sweden: his daughter Christina, then six years
old, was the natural heir.  The unavoidable weakness of a regency, suited ill with that energy
and resolution, which Sweden would be called upon to display in this trying conjuncture.  The
wide reaching mind of Gustavus Adolphus had raised this unimportant, and hitherto unknown kingdom,
to a rank among the powers of Europe, which it could not retain without the fortune and genius
of its author, and from which it could not recede, without a humiliating confession of weakness.
Though the German war had been conducted chiefly on the resources of Germany, yet even the
small contribution of men and money, which Sweden furnished, had sufficed to exhaust the finances
of that poor kingdom, and the peasantry groaned beneath the imposts necessarily laid upon them.
The plunder gained in Germany enriched only a few individuals, among the nobles and the soldiers,
while Sweden itself remained poor as before.  For a time, it is true, the national glory reconciled
the subject to these burdens, and the sums exacted, seemed but as a loan placed at interest,
in the fortunate hand of Gustavus Adolphus, to be richly repaid by the grateful monarch at
the conclusion of a glorious peace.  But with the king's death this hope vanished, and the
deluded people now loudly demanded relief from their burdens.

But the spirit of Gustavus Adolphus still lived in the men to whom he had confided the administration
of the kingdom.  However dreadful to them, and unexpected, was the intelligence of his death,
it did not deprive them of their manly courage; and the spirit of ancient Rome, under the invasion
of Brennus and Hannibal, animated this noble assembly.  The greater the price, at which these
hard-gained advantages had been purchased, the less readily could they reconcile themselves
to renounce them:  not unrevenged was a king to be sacrificed.  Called on to choose between
a doubtful and exhausting war, and a profitable but disgraceful peace, the Swedish council
of state boldly espoused the side of danger and honour; and with agreeable surprise, men beheld
this venerable senate acting with all the energy and enthusiasm of youth. Surrounded with watchful
enemies, both within and without, and threatened on every side with danger, they armed themselves
against them all, with equal prudence and heroism, and laboured to extend their kingdom, even
at the moment when they had to struggle for its existence.

The decease of the king, and the minority of his daughter Christina, renewed the claims of
Poland to the Swedish throne; and King Ladislaus, the son of Sigismund, spared no intrigues
to gain a party in Sweden.  On this ground, the regency lost no time in proclaiming the young
queen, and arranging the administration of the regency.  All the officers of the kingdom were
summoned to do homage to their new princess; all correspondence with Poland prohibited, and
the edicts of previous monarchs against the heirs of Sigismund, confirmed by a solemn act of
the nation.  The alliance with the Czar of Muscovy was carefully renewed, in order, by the
arms of this prince, to keep the hostile Poles in check.  The death of Gustavus Adolphus had
put an end to the jealousy of Denmark, and removed the grounds of alarm which had stood in
the way of a good understanding between the two states.  The representations by which the enemy
sought to stir up Christian IV.  against Sweden were no longer listened to; and the strong
wish the Danish monarch entertained for the marriage of his son Ulrick with the young princess,
combined, with the dictates of a sounder policy, to incline him to a neutrality. At the same
time, England, Holland, and France came forward with the gratifying assurances to the regency
of continued friendship and support, and encouraged them, with one voice, to prosecute with
activity the war, which hitherto had been conducted with so much glory.  Whatever reason France
might have to congratulate itself on the death of the Swedish conqueror, it was as fully sensible
of the expediency of maintaining the alliance with Sweden. The it, successes, "i stop, and with what
to a browser would have look in their debris," i think we were all pathetic privations! You've
were ache their successes!

"It was very real discipline, and were really previous-- and perhaps (i can altogether state it was
in age) just a little stir. At acceleration, and when i had complete, my arms were looking in way, and
Talbot cleared his pharynx of successes of he replied.  The death of Gustavus, far from breaking
up the alliance between France and Sweden, had only rendered it more necessary for both, and
more profitable for France.  Now, for the first time, since he was dead who had stretched his
protecting arm over Germany, and guarded its frontiers against the encroaching designs of France,
could the latter safely pursue its designs upon Alsace, and thus be enabled to sell its aid
to the German Protestants at a dearer rate.

Strengthened by these alliances, secured in its interior, and defended from without by strong
frontier garrisons and fleets, the regency did not delay an instant to continue a war, by which
Sweden had little of its own to lose, while, if success attended its arms, one or more of the
German provinces might be won, either as a conquest, or indemnification of its expenses.  Secure
amidst its seas, Sweden, even if driven out of Germany, would scarcely be exposed to greater
peril, than if it voluntarily retired from the contest, while the former measure was as honourable,
as the latter was disgraceful.  The more boldness the regency displayed, the more confidence
would they inspire among their confederates, the more respect among their enemies, and the
more favourable conditions might they anticipate in the event of peace.  If they found themselves
too weak to execute the wide-ranging projects of Gustavus, they at least owed it to this lofty
model to do their utmost, and to yield to no difficulty short of absolute necessity.  Alas,
that motives of self-interest had too great a share in this noble determination, to demand
our unqualified admiration! For those who had nothing themselves to suffer from the calamities
of war, but were rather to be enriched by it, it was an easy matter to resolve upon its continuation;
for the German empire was, in the end, to defray the expenses; and the provinces on which they
reckoned, would be cheaply purchased with the few troops they sacrificed to them, and with
the generals who were placed at the head of armies, composed for the most part of Germans,
and with the honourable superintendence of all the operations, both military and political.

But this superintendence was irreconcileable with the distance of the Swedish regency from
the scene of action, and with the slowness which necessarily accompanies all the movements
of a council.

To one comprehensive mind must be intrusted the management of Swedish interests in Germany,
and with full powers to determine at discretion all questions of war and peace, the necessary
alliances, or the acquisitions made.  With dictatorial power, and with the whole influence
of the crown which he was to represent, must this important magistrate be invested, in order
to maintain its dignity, to enforce united and combined operations, to give effect to his orders,
and to supply the place of the monarch whom he succeeded.  Such a man was found in the Chancellor
Oxenstiern, the first minister, and what is more, the friend of the deceased king, who, acquainted
with all the secrets of his master, versed in the politics of Germany, and in the relations
of all the states of Europe, was unquestionably the fittest instrument to carry out the plans
of Gustavus Adolphus in their full extent.

Oxenstiern was on his way to Upper Germany, in order to assemble the four Upper Circles, when
the news of the king's death reached him at Hanau.  This was a heavy blow, both to the friend
and the statesman. Sweden, indeed, had lost but a king, Germany a protector; but Oxenstiern,
the author of his fortunes, the friend of his soul, and the object of his admiration.  Though
the greatest sufferer in the general loss, he was the first who by his energy rose from the
blow, and the only one qualified to repair it.  His penetrating glance foresaw all the obstacles
which would oppose the execution of his plans, the discouragement of the estates, the intrigues
of hostile courts, the breaking up of the confederacy, the jealousy of the leaders, and the
dislike of princes of the empire to submit to foreign authority.  But even this deep insight
into the existing state of things, which revealed the whole extent of the evil, showed him
also the means by which it might be overcome.  It was essential to revive the drooping courage
of the weaker states, to meet the secret machinations of the enemy, to allay the jealousy of
the more powerful allies, to rouse the friendly powers, and France in particular, to active
assistance; but above all, to repair the ruined edifice of the German alliance, and to reunite
the scattered strength of the party by a close and permanent bond of union. The dismay which
the loss of their leader occasioned the German Protestants, might as readily dispose them to
a closer alliance with Sweden, as to a hasty peace with the Emperor; and it depended entirely
upon the course pursued, which of these alternatives they would adopt. Every thing might be
lost by the slightest sign of despondency; nothing, but the confidence which Sweden showed
in herself, could kindle among the Germans a noble feeling of self-confidence.  All the attempts
of Austria, to detach these princes from the Swedish alliance, would be unavailing, the moment
their eyes became opened to their true interests, and they were instigated to a public and
formal breach with the Emperor.

Before these measures could be taken, and the necessary points settled between the regency
and their minister, a precious opportunity of action would, it is true, be lost to the Swedish
army, of which the enemy would be sure to take the utmost advantage.  It was, in short, in
the power of the Emperor totally to ruin the Swedish interest in Germany, and to this he was
actually invited by the prudent councils of the Duke of Friedland.  Wallenstein advised him
to proclaim a universal amnesty, and to meet the Protestant states with favourable conditions.
In the first consternation produced by the fall of Gustavus Adolphus, such a declaration would
have had the most powerful effects, and probably would have brought the wavering states back
to their allegiance.  But blinded by this unexpected turn of fortune, and infatuated by Spanish
counsels, he anticipated a more brilliant issue from war, and, instead of listening to these
propositions of an accommodation, he hastened to augment his forces.  Spain, enriched by the
grant of the tenth of the ecclesiastical possessions, which the pope confirmed, sent him considerable
supplies, negociated for him at the Saxon court, and hastily levied troops for him in Italy
to be employed in Germany.  The Elector of Bavaria also considerably increased his military
force; and the restless disposition of the Duke of Lorraine did not permit him to remain inactive
in this favourable change of fortune.  But while the enemy were thus busy to profit by the
disaster of Sweden, Oxenstiern was diligent to avert its most fatal consequences.

Less apprehensive of open enemies, than of the jealousy of the friendly powers, he left Upper
Germany, which he had secured by conquests and alliances, and set out in person to prevent
a total defection of the Lower German states, or, what would have been almost equally ruinous
to Sweden, a private alliance among themselves.  Offended at the boldness with which the chancellor
assumed the direction of affairs, and inwardly exasperated at the thought of being dictated
to by a Swedish nobleman, the Elector of Saxony again meditated a dangerous separation from
Sweden; and the only question in his mind was, whether he should make full terms with the Emperor,
or place himself at the head of the Protestants and form a third party in Germany.  Similar
ideas were cherished by Duke Ulric of Brunswick, who, indeed, showed them openly enough by
forbidding the Swedes from recruiting within his dominions, and inviting the Lower Saxon states
to Luneburg, for the purpose of forming a confederacy among themselves.  The Elector of Brandenburg,
jealous of the influence which Saxony was likely to attain in Lower Germany, alone manifested
any zeal for the interests of the Swedish throne, which, in thought, he already destined for
his son.  At the court of Saxony, Oxenstiern was no doubt honourably received; but, notwithstanding
the personal efforts of the Elector of Brandenburg, empty promises of continued friendship
were all which he could obtain. With the Duke of Brunswick he was more successful, for with
him he ventured to assume a bolder tone.  Sweden was at the time in possession of the See of
Magdeburg, the bishop of which had the power of assembling the Lower Saxon circle.  The chancellor
now asserted the rights of the crown, and by this spirited proceeding, put a stop for the present
to this dangerous assembly designed by the duke. We and he were not circles? Are we or we not
circles? Do you or do you put to see with spirited-populate himself, whose white-equitable, the doctors,

"I had win more too for journey, and i appeared it miscarried he was
on journey was proceeding in which them appeared.  He himself opened the proceedings, and conducted the deliberations.  After receiving
from all the assembled estates assurances of unshaken fidelity, perseverance, and unity, he
required of them solemnly and formally to declare the Emperor and the league as enemies.  But
desirable as it was for Sweden to exasperate the ill-feeling between the emperor and the estates
into a formal rupture, the latter, on the other hand, were equally indisposed to shut out the
possibility of reconciliation, by so decided a step, and to place themselves entirely in the
hands of the Swedes.  They maintained, that any formal declaration of war was useless and superfluous,
where the act would speak for itself, and their firmness on this point silenced at last the
chancellor.  Warmer disputes arose on the third and principal article of the treaty, concerning
the means of prosecuting the war, and the quota which the several states ought to furnish for
the support of the army. Oxenstiern's maxim, to throw as much as possible of the common burden
on the states, did not suit very well with their determination to give as little as possible.
The Swedish chancellor now experienced, what had been felt by thirty emperors before him, to
their cost, that of all difficult undertakings, the most difficult was to extort money from
the Germans.  Instead of granting the necessary sums for the new armies to be raised, they
eloquently dwelt upon the calamities occasioned by the former, and demanded relief from the
old burdens, when they were required to submit to new.  The irritation which the chancellor's
demand for money raised among the states, gave rise to a thousand complaints; and the outrages
committed by the troops, in their marches and quarters, were dwelt upon with a startling minuteness
and truth.

In the service of two absolute monarchs, Oxenstiern had but little opportunity to become accustomed
to the formalities and cautious proceedings of republican deliberations, or to bear opposition
with patience.  Ready to act, the instant the necessity of action was apparent, and inflexible
in his resolution, when he had once taken it, he was at a loss to comprehend the inconsistency
of most men, who, while they desire the end, are yet averse to the means.  Prompt and impetuous
by nature, he was so on this occasion from principle; for every thing depended on concealing
the weakness of Sweden, under a firm and confident speech, and by assuming the tone of a lawgiver,
really to become so.  It was nothing wonderful, therefore, if, amidst these interminable discussions
with German doctors and deputies, he was entirely out of his sphere, and if the deliberateness
which distinguishes the character of the Germans in their public deliberations, had driven
him almost to despair.  Without respecting a custom, to which even the most powerful of the
emperors had been obliged to conform, he rejected all written deliberations which suited so
well with the national slowness of resolve.  He could not conceive how ten days could be spent
in debating a measure, which with himself was decided upon its bare suggestion.  Harshly, however,
as he treated the States, he found them ready enough to assent to his fourth motion, which
concerned himself.  When he pointed out the necessity of giving a head and a director to the
new confederation, that honour was unanimously assigned to Sweden, and he himself was humbly
requested to give to the common cause the benefit of his enlightened experience, and to take
upon himself the burden of the supreme command.  But in order to prevent his abusing the great
powers thus conferred upon him, it was proposed, not without French influence, to appoint a
number of overseers, in fact, under the name of assistants, to control the expenditure of the
common treasure, and to consult with him as to the levies, marches, and quarterings of the
troops.  Oxenstiern long and strenuously resisted this limitation of his authority, which could
not fail to trammel him in the execution of every enterprise requiring promptitude or secrecy,
and at last succeeded, with difficulty, in obtaining so far a modification of it, that his
management in affairs of war was to be uncontrolled. The chancellor finally approached the
delicate point of the indemnification which Sweden was to expect at the conclusion of the war,
from the gratitude of the allies, and flattered himself with the hope that Pomerania, the main
object of Sweden, would be assigned to her, and that he would obtain from the provinces, assurances
of effectual cooperation in its acquisition.  But he could obtain nothing more than a vague
assurance, that in a general peace the interests of all parties would be attended to.  That
on this point, the caution of the estates was not owing to any regard for the constitution
of the empire, became manifest from the liberality they evinced towards the chancellor, at
the expense of the most sacred laws of the empire.  They were ready to grant him the archbishopric
of Mentz, (which he already held as a conquest,) and only with difficulty did the French ambassador
succeed in preventing a step, which was as impolitic as it was disgraceful.  Though on the
whole, the result of the congress had fallen far short of Oxenstiern's expectations, he had
at least gained for himself and his crown his main object, namely, the direction of the whole
confederacy; he had also succeeded in strengthening the bond of union between the four upper
circles, and obtained from the states a yearly contribution of two millions and a half of dollars,
for the maintenance of the army.

These concessions on the part of the States, demanded some return from Sweden.  A few weeks
after the death of Gustavus Adolphus, sorrow ended the days of the unfortunate Elector Palatine.
For eight months he had swelled the pomp of his protector's court, and expended on it the small
remainder of his patrimony.  He was, at last, approaching the goal of his wishes, and the prospect
of a brighter future was opening, when death deprived him of his protector.  But what he regarded
as the greatest calamity, was highly favourable to his heirs.  Gustavus might venture to delay
the restoration of his dominions, or to load the gift with hard conditions; but Oxenstiern,
to whom the friendship of England, Holland, and Brandenburg, and the good opinion of the Reformed
States were indispensable, felt the necessity of immediately fulfilling the obligations of
justice.  At this assembly, at Heilbronn, therefore, he engaged to surrender to Frederick's
heirs the whole Palatinate, both the part already conquered, and that which remained to be
conquered, with the exception of Manheim, which the Swedes were to hold, until they should
be indemnified for their expenses.  The Chancellor did not confine his liberality to the family
of the Palatine alone; the other allied princes received proofs, though at a later period,
of the gratitude of Sweden, which, however, she dispensed at little cost to herself.

Impartiality, the most sacred obligation of the historian, here compels us to an admission,
not much to the honour of the champions of German liberty.  However the Protestant Princes
might boast of the justice of their cause, and the sincerity of their conviction, still the
motives from which they acted were selfish enough; and the desire of stripping others of their
possessions, had at least as great a share in the commencement of hostilities, as the fear
of being deprived of their own. Gustavus soon found that he might reckon much more on these
selfish motives, than on their patriotic zeal, and did not fail to avail himself of them. 
Each of his confederates received from him the promise of some possession, either already wrested,
or to be afterwards taken from the enemy; and death alone prevented him from fulfilling these
engagements. What prudence had suggested to the king, necessity now prescribed to his successor.
If it was his object to continue the war, he must be ready to divide the spoil among the allies,
and promise them advantages from the confusion which it was his object to continue.  Thus he
promised to the Landgrave of Hesse, the abbacies of Paderborn, Corvey, Munster, and Fulda;
to Duke Bernard of Weimar, the Franconian Bishoprics; to the Duke of Wirtemberg, the Ecclesiastical
domains, and the Austrian counties lying within his territories, all under the title of fiefs
of Sweden. This spectacle, so strange and so dishonourable to the German character, surprised
the Chancellor, who found it difficult to repress his contempt, and on one occasion exclaimed,
"Let it be writ in our records, for an everlasting memorial, that a German prince made such
a request of a Swedish nobleman, and that the Swedish nobleman granted it to the German upon
German ground!"

After these successful measures, he was in a condition to take the field, and prosecute the
war with fresh vigour.  Soon after the victory at Lutzen, the troops of Saxony and Lunenburg
united with the Swedish main body; and the Imperialists were, in a short time, totally driven
from Saxony.  The united army again divided:  the Saxons marched towards Lusatia and Silesia,
to act in conjunction with Count Thurn against the Austrians in that quarter; a part of the
Swedish army was led by the Duke of Weimar into Franconia, and the other by George, Duke of
Brunswick, into Westphalia and Lower Saxony.

The conquests on the Lech and the Danube, during Gustavus's expedition into Saxony, had been
maintained by the Palatine of Birkenfeld, and the Swedish General Banner, against the Bavarians;
but unable to hold their ground against the victorious progress of the latter, supported as
they were by the bravery and military experience of the Imperial General Altringer, they were
under the necessity of summoning the Swedish General Horn to their assistance, from Alsace.
This experienced general having captured the towns of Benfeld, Schlettstadt, Colmar, and Hagenau,
committed the defence of them to the Rhinegrave Otto Louis, and hastily crossed the Rhine to
form a junction with Banner's army.  But although the combined force amounted to more than
16,000, they could not prevent the enemy from obtaining a strong position on the Swabian frontier,
taking Kempten, and being joined by seven regiments from Bohemia.  In order to retain the command
of the important banks of the Lech and the Danube, they were under the necessity of recalling
the Rhinegrave Otto Louis from Alsace, where he had, after the departure of Horn, found it
difficult to defend himself against the exasperated peasantry.  With his army, he was now summoned
to strengthen the army on the Danube; and as even this reinforcement was insufficient, Duke
Bernard of Weimar was earnestly pressed to turn his arms into this quarter.

Duke Bernard, soon after the opening of the campaign of 1633, had made himself master of the
town and territory of Bamberg, and was now threatening Wurtzburg.  But on receiving the summons
of General Horn, without delay he began his march towards the Danube, defeated on his way a
Bavarian army under John de Werth, and joined the Swedes near Donauwerth.  This numerous force,
commanded by excellent generals, now threatened Bavaria with a fearful inroad.  The bishopric
of Eichstadt was completely overrun, and Ingoldstadt was on the point of being delivered up
by treachery to the Swedes.  Altringer, fettered in his movements by the express order of the
Duke of Friedland, and left without assistance from Bohemia, was unable to check the progress
of the enemy.  The most favourable circumstances combined to further the progress of the Swedish
arms in this quarter, when the operations of the army were at once stopped by a mutiny among
the officers.

All the previous successes in Germany were owing altogether to arms; the greatness of Gustavus
himself was the work of the army, the fruit of their discipline, their bravery, and their persevering
courage under numberless dangers and privations. "it've been figgering," he answer.

  All the decisive
advantages of the war, had been violently gained by a barbarous sacrifice of the soldiers'
lives in winter campaigns, forced marches, stormings, and pitched battles; for it was Gustavus's
maxim never to decline a battle, so long as it cost him nothing but men.  The soldiers could
not long be kept ignorant of their own importance, and they justly demanded a share in the
spoil which had been won by their own blood. Yet, frequently, they hardly received their pay;
and the rapacity of individual generals, or the wants of the state, generally swallowed up
the greater part of the sums raised by contributions, or levied upon the conquered provinces.
For all the privations he endured, the soldier had no other recompense than the doubtful chance
either of plunder or promotion, in both of which he was often disappointed.  During the lifetime
of Gustavus Adolphus, the combined influence of fear and hope had suppressed any open complaint,
but after his death, the murmurs were loud and universal; and the soldiery seized the most
dangerous moment to impress their superiors with a sense of their importance.  Two officers,
Pfuhl and Mitschefal, notorious as restless characters, even during the King's life, set the
example in the camp on the Danube, which in a few days was imitated by almost all the officers
of the army.  They solemnly bound themselves to obey no orders, till these arrears, now outstanding
for months, and even years, should be paid up, and a gratuity, either in money or lands, made
to each man, according to his services.  "Immense sums," they said, "were daily raised by contributions,
and all dissipated by a few.  They were called out to serve amidst frost and snow, and no reward
requited their incessant labours.  The soldiers' excesses at Heilbronn had been blamed, but
no one ever talked of their services.  The world rung with the tidings of conquests and victories,
but it was by their hands that they had been fought and won."

The number of the malcontents daily increased; and they even attempted by letters, (which were
fortunately intercepted,) to seduce the armies on the Rhine and in Saxony.  Neither the representations
of Bernard of Weimar, nor the stern reproaches of his harsher associate in command, could suppress
this mutiny, while the vehemence of Horn seemed only to increase the insolence of the insurgents.
The conditions they insisted on, were that certain towns should be assigned to each regiment
for the payment of arrears.  Four weeks were allowed to the Swedish Chancellor to comply with
these demands; and in case of refusal, they announced that they would pay themselves, and never
more draw a sword for Sweden.

These pressing demands, made at the very time when the military chest was exhausted, and credit
at a low ebb, greatly embarrassed the chancellor.  The remedy, he saw, must be found quickly,
before the contagion should spread to the other troops, and he should be deserted by all his
armies at once.  Among all the Swedish generals, there was only one of sufficient authority
and influence with the soldiers to put an end to this dispute.  The Duke of Weimar was the
favourite of the army, and his prudent moderation had won the good-will of the soldiers, while
his military experience had excited their admiration.  He now undertook the task of appeasing
the discontented troops; but, aware of his importance, he embraced the opportunity to make
advantageous stipulations for himself, and to make the embarrassment of the chancellor subservient
to his own views.
