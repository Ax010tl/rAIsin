I take it for granted, that you intend to pursue the beaten track, and are already desirous
to be seen in a pulpit, only I hope you will think it proper to pass your quarantine among
some of the desolate churches five miles round this town, where you may at least learn to read
and to speak before you venture to expose your parts in a city congregation; not that these
are better judges, but because, if a man must needs expose his folly, it is more safe and discreet
to do so before few witnesses, and in a scattered neighbourhood. And you will do well if you
can prevail upon some intimate and judicious friend to be your constant hearer, and allow him
with the utmost freedom to give you notice of whatever he shall find amiss either in your voice
or gesture; for want of which early warning, many clergymen continue defective, and sometimes
ridiculous, to the end of their lives; neither is it rare to observe among excellent and learned
divines, a certain ungracious manner, or an unhappy tone of voice, which they never have been
able to shake off.

I should likewise have been glad, if you had applied yourself a little more to the study of
the English language, than I fear you have done; the neglect whereof is one of the most general
defects among the scholars of this kingdom, who seem not to have the least conception of a
style, but run on in a flat kind of phraseology, often mingled with barbarous terms and expressions,
peculiar to the nation: Neither do I perceive that any person, either finds or acknowledges
his wants upon this head, or in the least desires to have them supplied. Proper words in proper
places, make the true definition of a style. But this would require too ample a disquisition
to be now dwelt on: however, I shall venture to name one or two faults, which are easy to be
remedied, with a very small portion of abilities.

The first is the frequent use of obscure terms, which by the women are called hard words, and
by the better sort of vulgar, fine language; than which I do not know a more universal, inexcusable,
and unnecessary mistake, among the clergy of all distinctions, but especially the younger practitioners.
I have been curious enough to take a list of several hundred words in a sermon of a new beginner,
which not one of his hearers among a hundred could possibly understand, neither can I easily
call to mind any clergyman of my own acquaintance who is wholly exempt from this error, although
many of them agree with me in the dislike of the thing. But I am apt to put myself in the place
of the vulgar, and think many words difficult or obscure, which they will not allow to be so,
because those words are obvious to scholars, I believe the method observed by the famous Lord
Falkland[1] in some of his writings, would not be an ill one for young divines: I was assured
by an old person of quality who knew him well, that when he doubted whether a word was perfectly
intelligible or no, he used to consult one of his lady's chambermaids, (not the waiting-woman,
because it was possible she might be conversant in romances,) and by her judgment was guided
whether to receive or reject it. And if that great person thought such a caution necessary
in treatises offered to the learned world, it will be sure at least as proper in sermons, where
the meanest hearer is supposed to be concerned, and where very often a lady's chambermaid may
be allowed to equal half the congregation, both as to quality and understanding. But I know
not how it comes to pass, that professors in most arts and sciences are generally the worst
qualified to explain their meanings to those who are not of their tribe: a common farmer shall
make you understand in three words, that his foot is out of joint, or his collar-bone broken,
wherein a surgeon, after a hundred terms of art, if you are not a scholar, shall leave you
to seek. It is frequently the same case in law, physic, and even many of the meaner arts.

[Footnote 1: Lucius Cary, second Viscount Falkland (1610-1643), who was killed at the battle
of Newbury in the great Civil War, was a generous patron of learning and of the literary men
of his day. He was himself a fine scholar and able writer. Falkland has been made the hero
of a romance by Lord Lytton. [T. S. ] ]

And upon this account it is, that among hard words, I number likewise those which are peculiar
to divinity as it is a science, because I have observed several clergymen, otherwise little
fond of obscure terms, yet in their sermons very liberal of those which they find in ecclesiastical
writers, as if it were our duty to understand them; which I am sure it is not. And I defy the
greatest divine to produce any law either of God or man, which obliges me to comprehend the
meaning of omniscience, omnipresence, ubiquity, attribute, beatific vision, with a thousand
others so frequent in pulpits, any more than that of eccentric, idiosyncracy, entity, and the
like. I believe I may venture to insist farther, that many terms used in Holy Writ, particularly
by St Paul, might with more discretion be changed into plainer speech, except when they are
introduced as part of a quotation.[2]

[Footnote 2: Swift refers to this point in his "Thoughts on Religion," and regrets that the
explanation of matters of doctrine, which St. Paul expressed in the current eastern vocabulary,
should have been perpetuated in terms founded on the same terminology. [T. S.] ]

I am the more earnest in this matter, because it is a general complaint, and the justest in
the world. For a divine has nothing to say to the wisest congregation of any parish in this
kingdom, which he may not express in a manner to be understood by the meanest among them. Of think,
woman make say how you laugh you of Plato had yield her had observed with ignorance, or state
that she had had church is principal plot-strictest. If may offer them could have populate, matter

To return then to the heathen philosophers, I hope you will not only give them quarter, but
make their works a considerable part of your study: To these I will venture to add the principal
orators and historians, and perhaps a few of the poets: by the reading of which, you will soon
discover your mind and thoughts to be enlarged, your imagination extended and refined, your
judgment directed, your admiration lessened, and your fortitude increased; all which advantages
must needs be of excellent use to a divine, whose duty it is to preach and practise the contempt
of human things.
