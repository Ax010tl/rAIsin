INTERVIEW MILLIE SIMPKINS "BLACK MAMIE" 1004 10th Avenue, No. Nashville, Tennessee

I claims I's 109 ye'ars ole en wuz bawn neah Winchester, Tennessee. Mah marster wuz Boyd Sims
en mah missis wuz Sarah Ann Ewing Sims. Mah mammy wus named Judy Ewing en mah daddy wuz Moses
Stephens en he wus "free bawn." He wuz de marster's stable boy en followed de races. He run
'way en nebber kum back.

Mah fust missis wuz very rich. She had two slave 'omen ter dress her eve'y mawnin' en I brought
her breakfust ter her on a silvah waitah. She wuz ma'ied three times, her second husband wuz
Joe Carter en de third wuz Judge Gork.

Mah fust missis sold me kaze I wuz stubborn. She sent me ter de "slave yard" at Nashville.
De yard wuz full ob slaves. I stayed dere two weeks 'fore marster Simpson bought me. I wuz
sold 'way fum mah husband en I nebber se'd 'im 'gin. I had one chile which I tuk wid me.

De slave yard wuz on Cedar Street. A Mr. Chandler would bid de slaves off, but 'fore dey started
biddin' you had ter tek all ob yo Clothes off en roll down de hill so dey could see dat you
didn't hab no bones broken, er sores on yer. (I wouldin' tek mine off). Ef nobody bid on you,
you wuz tuk ter de slave mart en sold. I wuz sold dere. A bunch ob dem wuz sent ter Mississippi
en dey had dere ankles fas'end tergedder en dey had ter walk w'iles de tradahs rid.

W'en I wuz sold ter marster Simpkins, mah second mistress made me a house slave en I wuked
only at de big house en mah wuk wus ter nuss en dress de chilluns en he'ps mah missis in her
dressin'.

De young slaves wuz hired out ter nuss de white chilluns. I wuz hired as nuss girl at seven
y'ars ole en started cookin' at ten. I nebber had a chance ter go ter schul.

I'm de mammy ob 14 chilluns, seven boys en seven gals. I wuz next ter de olest ob four chillun.
Mah missis useter hire me out ter hotels en taverns.

Sum marsters fed dare slaves meat en sum wouldin' let dem hab a bite. One marster we useter
'yer 'bout would grease his slaves mouth on Sunday mawnin', en tell dem ef any body axed ef
dey had meat ter say "yes, lots ob hit".

W'en dey got ready ter whup dem dey'd put dem down on a pit widout any clothes, stand back
wid a bull whup en cut de blood out. I member de niggers would run 'way en hide out.

De only fun de young folks had wuz w'en de ole folks had a quiltin'. W'ile de ole folks wuz
wukin' on de quilt de young ones would git in 'nuther room, dance en hab a good time. Dey'd
hab a pot turned down at de do'er ter keep de white folks fum 'yearin' dem. De white folks
didn't want us ter l'arn nothin' en ef a slave picked up a lettle piece ob papah, dey would
yell "put dat down you--you wan't ter git in our business."

De white folks wouldin' let de slaves pray, ef dey got ter pray hit wuz w'iles walkin' 'hind
de plow. White folks would whup de slaves ef dey 'yeard dem sing er pray.

I wuz a big girl w'en dey build de Capitol. I played on de hill 'fore hit wuz built en I toted
blocks fum dere w'en hit wuz bein' built. I wuz livin' in Dickson County w'en Fort Donelson
wuz tuk. I seed de fust gun boat dat kum up de Cumberland River. I wuz standin' in de Do'er
w'en I se'd hit kumin', but hit didn't tek me long ter git back in de back ob de house. I wuz
skeered dey would shoot.

Mah marster run a fer'y en atter de gun boat kum up de riber, he got skeered en gib mah ole
man de fer'y, en w'en de soldiers kum ter tek Fort Negley he set dem 'cross de river.

A man at Ashland City dat made whisk'y would hab Mr. Simpkins bring a load ob logs up ter Ashland
City en den bring a load ob whiskey down en hide hit so de Yankees would'nt git hit.

Mah marster had a fish trap at de mouth ob Harper en w'en de gun boat passed dey shot thro'
de trap.

I wuz right 'yer w'en de Civil wah wuz gwin on, en de soldiers wuz dressed up en beatin' de drums.

No honey we didn't git nothin' w'en we wuz freed. Jes druv 'way widout nothin' ter do wid.
We got in a waggin en druv ter nuther man's plantashun. Mah ole man made a crap dere. Sum ob
de slaves might hab got sump'in but I dunno nobody dat did. I wuz skeered ter op'n mah do'er
atter dark on 'count ob Ku Klux Klan, dey wuz red hot.

I member w'en de sta'rs fell. I wuz small but de ole folks run out en looked at dem, kum back
set down en cried, dey tho't hit me'nt de worl' wuz kumin' ter an end.

De peeple wuz skeered w'en dey se'd de comet wid de long tail. Dey tho't hit wuz a sign ob wah.

I'se cooked eve'y since I wuz freed. I stayed in Henry Galbles kitchen five long y'ars, en
since I'se had dese strokes hit's broke me up 'till I kin do nothin'. I 'long ter de Methodist
Church. I think de young peeples ez turrible, en dis white en black mar'iags not be 'lowed.

De songs I member ez:

"Dark wuz de Night". "Good Ole Daniel".

I'se nebber voted but I'se electioneered fer dem. Hab nebber had any frens in office.

I wuz 'yer w'en Henry Clay en James K. Polk wuz runnin'. I wuz hired at de ole City Hotel ovuh
on de river. I wuz din'in room servant dere. Mah marster would hab me sing a song fer him 'bout
de Democrats. "Hooray de kuntry ez risin'; rise up en drown ole Clay en his pizen". I guess
ole Clay wuz a right good fellow but he played cards wid de niggers in de cellar.

De only thing I member 'bout de 'structshun time wuz sum ob de whites didn't wan' de niggers
ter vote.

I stays 'yer wid mah daughter. Dat ez de only support I hab since I had deze strokes en bin
unable ter do fer mahse'f.

Ex-Slave Stories

Subject: Joseph Leonidas Star, # 133 Quebec Place, Knoxville, Tennessee

If the poetic strain in the Dunbar Negroes of the south is an inheritance and not "just a gift
from On High," Knoxville, Tennessee's aged Negro Poet,--born Joseph Leonidas Star,--but prominently
known in the community as "Lee" Star, Poet, Politician and Lodge Man,--thinks that Georgia's
poetic genius Paul Lawrence Dunbar, "maybe took his writin' spells" from him.

"My grandfather and Paul Lawrence Dunbar's grandfather was cousins. He were a much younger
man than I am, for I was eighty-one years old the twenty-sixth of December, 1937. So I reckon
I give it down to my kin-man. But it seem to me, that Poets is just born thataway. Po'try is
nothin' but Truth anyway, and it's Truth was sets us free. And that makes me a free-born citizen
bothways and every ways. I were born free. I were always happy-natured and I expect to die
thataway. One of my poems is named, 'Be Satisfied!' and I say in it that if a man's got somethin'
to eat, and teeth to bite, he should be satisfied. You cant take your goods with you. Old man
Rockefeller, when he died here awhile back, went away from here 'thout his hat and shoes. That's
the way its goin' to be with all us, no matter what our color is."

"The people 'round here calls me "Lee" Star, and I want to tell you, Lee Star is a free-born
man. But of course, things bein' as they were, both my mother and father were slaves. That
is for a few years. They lived in Greenville, Tennessee. My mother, Maria Guess, was free'd
before the emancipation, by the good words of her young white mistress, who told 'me [TR: 'em]
all when she was about to die, she wanted 'em to set Maria free, 'cause she didn't want her
little playmate to be nobodys else's slave. They was playmates you see. My mother was eleven
years old when she was freed."

"When she was about fourteen and my father Henry Dunbar wanted to marry he had to first buy
his freedom. In them times a slave couldn't marry a free'd person. So he bought his freedom
from his Marster Lloyd Bullen, and a good friend of Andrew Johnson, the presi-dent. My father
an' him was friends too. So he bought his freedom, for just a little of somethin' I disremember
what, 'cause they didn't aim to make him buy his freedom high. He made good money though. He
was a carpenter, blacksmith, shoe maker and knowed a lot more trades. His Master was broadhearted,
and good to his slaves, and he let 'em work at anything they want to, when they was done their
part of white folks chore-work."

"Both my father and mother was learned in the shoe makin' trade. When they come to Knoxville
to live, and where I was born, they had a great big shoe shop out there close to where Governor
Brownlow lived. Knoxville just had three streets, two runnin' east and west and one run north
and south. I well remember when General Burnside come to Knoxville. That was endurin' the siege
of Knoxville. Before he marched his men out to the Battle of Fort Saunders, he stopped his
solider [TR: soldier] band in front of our shoe shop and serenaded my mother and father. I
was a little boy and I climed up on the porch bannisters and sat there and lissen' to that music."

"I remember another big man come here once when I was a boy and I served the transient trade
at a little eatin' place right where the Atkin Ho-tel is now. Jeff Davis come there to eat,
when he stopped over between trains. That was in 1869. No, I disremember what he eat or how
he behave. He didnt seem no different from any other man. He was nince lookin' wore a long
tail coat and his boots was plenty blacked. He favored pictures of Abraham Lincoln. Was about
middle-height and had short, dark chin-whiskers. I were very busy at the time, an' if they
was any excitement I didnt know it."

"Yes, I've seen many a slave in my day. One of my boy playmates was a slave child. His name
is Sam Rogan and he lives now at the County Poor Farm. I make it a point not to dwell too much
on slave times. I was learned different. I've had considerable schoolin', went to my first
school in the old First Presbyterian church. My teachers was white folks from the North. They
give us our education and give us clothes and things sent down here from the North. That was
just after the surrender. I did see a terrible sight once. A slave with chains on him as long
as from here to the street. He was in an ole' buggy, settin' between two white men and they
was passin' througn Knoxville. My mother and father wouldnt lissen' to me tell 'em about it
when I got home. And I hope I forget everything I ever knowed or heard about salves [TR: slaves],
and slave times."

Joseph Leonidas Star, no longer works at the shoemakers trade. He writes poetry and lives leisurely
in a three room frame shanty, in a row of shabbier ones that face each other disconsolately
on a typical Negro alleyway, that has no shade trees and no paving. "Lee's" house is the only
one that does not wabble uneasily, flush with the muddy alley. His stands on a small brick
foundation, a few feet behind a privet hedge in front, with a brick wall along the side in
which he has cemented a few huge conch shells.

After fifty-four years residence here, a political boss in his ward, and the only Negro member
of the Young White Men's Republican League, Star's influence in his community is attested by
the fact that when he "destructed", the Knoxville City Council to "please do somethin' about
it, Knoxville being too big a city to keep callin' street's alleys," the City Council promptly
and unanimously voted to change the name of King's Alley to Quebec Place.

When the interviewer called, Star's door was padlocked. But he appeared soon, having received
word by the grape-vine system that some one "was to see him",--"They told me it was the Sherriff"
he laughed. He came down the long muddy alley at a lively clip. He claimes he is able to walk
about 20 miles each day, just to keep in condition. He wore a broad-brimmed black "derby-hat",
a neatly pressed serge suit in two tones, a soiled white pleated shirt and a frazzled-edged
black bow tie. His coat lapels and vest-front were adorned with badges and emblems, including
his Masonic pins, a Friendship Medal, his Republican button and a silver crucifix. The Catholic
church, according to Lee, is the only one in Knoxville which permits the black man to worship
under the same roof with his white brothers.

Many of Star's poems have been published in the local and state papers. He keeps a record of
deaths of all citizens, and has done so for sixty years. He calls the one, which records murders
and hanging, his "Doomsday Book", and "encoached" in it he claims is an accurate date record
of all such events of importance in his lifetime. His records are neatly inscribed in a printing
form and very legible. His conversation is marked by grammatical incongruities, but he does
not speak the Negro dialect.

INTERVIEW DAN THOMAS 941 Jefferson Street Nashville, Tennessee

"I wuz bawn in slavery in 1847 at Memphis, Tennessee en mah marster wuz Deacon Allays. Mah

"I voted three times in mah life but lawdy dat wuz a long time ago. I voted fer Teddy Roosevelt

"Hab no tales handed down by mah peeple. W'en I would try ter git info'mation, atter I got

"Oh mah goodness! Hit jes par'lises me ter see how dem young peeple ez doin' terday. Lawdy

hab gone astray. Wuz tole lots 'bout de Ku Klux Klan en how dey would catch en whup de cul'ed

"I member seein' Andrew Jackson, General Grant en Abraham Lincoln, member seein' General Andrew
Jackson git'in ready fer war by marchin' his soldiers erroun'. I se'd 'im ride his big white
hoss up en down ter see how dey marched."

"One song I lack'd best ob all wuz, 'Mah ole Mammy ez De'd en Gon',' 'Let me Sit B'neath de
Willow Tree.' Don't member uther songs now."

INTERVIEW Sylvia Watkins 411 14th Avenue N. Nashville, Tennessee.

I'se said ter be 91 y'ars ole. I wuz young w'en de War wuz goin' on. I wuz bawn in Bedford
County. Mah mammy wuz named Mariah. She had six chillun by mah daddy en three by her fust husband.

Mah missis wuz named Emily Hatchet en de young missises wuz Mittie en Bettie, dey wuz twins.
We had good clothes ter w'ar en w'en we went ter de table hit wuz loaded wid good food en we
could set down en eat our stomachs full. Oh Lawd I wish dem days wuz now so I'd hab sum good
food. Ob course, we had ter wuk in de fiel's en mek w'at we et.

Wen we'd finish our day's wuk our missis would let us go out en play hide en seek, Puss in
de corner, en diff'ent games.

Mah mammy wuz sold in Virginia w'en she wuz a gurl. She sezs 'bou 60 ob em wuz put in de road
en druv down 'yer by a slave trader, lak a bunch ob cattle. Mah mammy en two ob mah sistahs
wuz put on a block, sold en carried ter Alabama. We neber 'yeard fum dem nomo', en dunno whar
dey ez.

I wuz willed ter mah young missis w'en she ma'ried. I wuz young en, ob course, she whuped me,
but she wasn't mean ter me. I needed eve'y whupin' she eber gib me, cause I wuz allus fightin'.
Mah missis allus called me her lettle nig.

Mah daddy could only see mah mammy Wednesday en Saturday nites, en ef'n he kum wid'out a pass
de pat-rollers would whup 'im er run 'im 'til his tongue hung out. On dem nites we would sit
up en look fer daddy en lots ob times he wuz out ob bref cose he had run so much.

Mah white folks had a loom en we wove our own clothes. I wuz nuss en house girl en l'arned
how ter sew en nit. Mah young missis wuz blind 'fore she died. I useter visit her once a Ye'r
en she'd load me down wid things ter tek home, a linsey petticoat, ham bones, cracklins en
diff'ent things. She died 18 years ago almos' a 100 ye'r ole.

De white folks wouldn't let de slaves hab a book er papah fer fear dey'd l'arn sumpin', en
ef dey wan'ed ter pray dey'd tu'n a kettle down at dere cabin do'er. I member yearin' mah mammy
pray "Oh Father op'n up de do'ers en sho us lite." I'd look up ter de ceiling ter see ef he
wuz gonna op'n up sumpin'; silly, silly me, thinkin' such. I's 'longs ter de Missionary Baptist
chuch but I don't git ter go very off'n.

I wuz tole 'fore freedum dat de slaves would git a mule, land en a new suit, but our missis
didn't gib us a thing. She promis' me, mah br'rer, en three sistahs ef'n we would stay wid
her a ye'r, en he'p her mek a crop she would gib us sump'in ter start us a crop on w'en we
lef' her.

Mah daddy's marster wus named Bob Rankin, he gib mah daddy a hog, sum chickens, let him hab
a cow ter milk en land ter raise a crop on. He wan'ed mah daddy ter git us tergedder ter he'p
daddy raise a crop but since mah missis had promised us so much, daddy let us stay wid her
a ye'r. On de nite mah daddy kum fer us, mah missis sezs I've not got nuthin ter gib you, fer
I won't hab nobody ter do nuthin fer me. We went wid our daddy. We lived dere on Marster Rankin's
farm fer ye'rs in fact so long we tho't de place 'longed ter mah daddy. We had a house wid
big cracks in hit, had a big fier place, a big pot dat hong on de fier en a skillet dat we
cooked corn bread in. Had a hill ob taters under de house, would raise up a plank, rake down
in de dirt git taters, put dem in de fier ter roast. We had meat ter eat in de middle ob de
day but none at mawnin' er nite. We got one pair ob shoes a ye'r, dey had brass on de toes.
I uster git out en shine de toes ob mine, we called hit gol' on our shoes. We wuked in de fiel'
wid mah daddy, en I know how ter do eberting dere ez ter do in a fiel' 'cept plow, I wuz allus
ter slender ter hold a plow. We had grease lamps. A thing lak a goose neck wid platted rag
wick in hit. Would put grease in hit.

Durin' slavery ef one marster had a big boy en 'nuther had a big gal da marsters made dem libe
tergedder. Ef'n de 'oman didn't hab any chilluns, she wuz put on de block en sold en 'nuther
'oman bought. You see dey raised de chilluns ter mek money on jes lak we raise pigs ter sell.

Mah mammy tole me 'bout de sta'rs fallin' en den I se'ed de second fallin' ob sta'rs. Dey didn't
hit de groun' lak de fust did. I member de comet hit had a long tail. I lef' mah daddy en kum
ter Nashville wid missis Nellie Rankin, (daddy's young missus) in 1882; hab bin 'yer eber since.
I'se dun house wuk fer a lot ob peeples. Kep house fer a 'oman in Belle Meade fer 14 ye'rs.
Now I'se aint able ter do nothin. I'se bin ma'ried twice. Ma'ried Jimm Ferguson, libed wid
'im 20 ye'ars he d'ed. Two ye'ars later I mar'ed George Watkins, lived wid him 8 ye'ars; two
ye'ars ago he died. I'se neber had any chilluns. I kep wan'in ter 'dopt a lettle gal, de fust
husban' wouldn't do hit. 'Bout 5-1/2 ye'ars ago de second husban' George kum in wid a tiny
baby, sezs 'yer ez a boy baby I 'dopted. I sezs dat ez you own baby cose hits jes like yer.
He denied hit, but eben now de boy ez e'zackly lak George. He's six ye'rs ole en gwine ter
school. I'se got mah hands full tryin' ter raise 'im 'lone. W'en George died he had a small
inshorance policy. I paid mah taxes, I owns dis home, en bought mahself three hogs. I sold
two en kilt one. Den I got three mor' jes' a short time ago. Sum kind ob zeeze got among dem
en dey all d'ed.

Yas I'se voted four er five times, but neber had any frens in office. I don' think dis white-black
mar'iage should be 'lowed. Dey should be whupped wid a bull whup.

As far as I know de ex-slaves hab wuked at diff'ent kins ob jobs en now sum I know ez in de
po-house, sum git' in relief order en urthers ez lak mahself, hab dere homes en gettin' 'long
