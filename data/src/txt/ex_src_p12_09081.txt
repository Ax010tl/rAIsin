MARSE CHAN.

A TALE OF OLD VIRGINIA.

BY THOMAS NELSON PAGE.

Century Magazine April, 1884.

One afternoon, in the autumn of 1872, I was riding leisurely down the sandy road that winds
along the top of the water-shed between two of the smaller rivers of eastern Virginia. The
road I was travelling, following "the ridge" for miles, had just struck me as most significant
of the character of the race whose only avenue of communication with the outside world it had
formerly been. Their once splendid mansions, now fast falling to decay, appeared to view from
time to time, set back far from the road, in proud seclusion among groves of oak and hickory
now scarlet and gold with the early frost. Distance was nothing to this people; time was of
no consequence to them. They desired but a level path in life, and that they had, though the
way was longer and the outer world strode by them as they dreamed.

I was aroused from my reflections by hearing some one ahead of me calling, "Heah!--heah-whoo-oop,
heah!"

Turning the curve in the road, I saw just before me a negro standing, with a hoe and a watering-pot
in his hand. He had evidently just gotten over the "worm-fence" into the road, out of the path
which led zigzag across the "old field" and was lost to sight in the dense growth of sassafras.
When I rode up, he was looking anxiously back down this path for his dog. So engrossed was
he that he did not even hear my horse, and I reined in to wait until he should turn around
and satisfy my curiosity as to the handsome old place half a mile off from the road.

The numerous out-buildings and the large barns and stables told that it had once been the seat
of wealth, and the wild waste of sassafras that covered the broad fields gave it an air of
desolation that greatly excited my interest. Entirely oblivious of my proximity, the negro
went on calling, "Whoo-oop, heah!" until along the path, walking very slowly and with great
dignity, appeared a noble-looking old orange and white setter, gray with age, and corpulent
with excessive feeding. As soon as he came in sight, his master began:

"Yes, dat you! You gittin' deaf as well as bline, I s'pose! Kyarnt heah me callin', I reckon?
Whyn't yo' come on, dawg?"

The setter sauntered slowly up to the fence and stopped without even deigning a look at the
speaker, who immediately proceeded to take the rails down, talking meanwhile:

"Now, I got to pull down de gap, I s'pose! Yo' so sp'ilt yo' kyahn' hardly walk. Jes' ez able
to git over it as I is! Jes' like white folks--t'ink 'cuz you's white and I's black, I got
to wait on yo' all de time. Ne'm mine, I ain' gwi' do it!"

The fence having been pulled down sufficiently low to suit his dogship, he marched sedately
through, and, with a hardly perceptible lateral movement of his tail, walked on down the road.
Putting up the rails carefully, the negro turned and saw me.

"Sarvent, marster," he said, taking his hat off. Then, as if apologetically for having permitted
a stranger to witness what was merely a family affair, he added: "He know I don' mean nothin'
by what I sez. He's Marse Chan's dawg, an' he's so ole he kyahn git long no pearter. He know
I'se jes' prodjickin' wid 'im."

"Who is Marse Chan?" I asked; "and whose place is that over there--and the one a mile or two
back--the place with the big gate and the carved stone pillars?"

"Marse Chan," said the darkey, "he's Marse Channin'--my young marster; an' dem places--dis
one's Weall's, an' de one back dyar wid de rock gate-pos's is ole Cun'l Chahmb'lin's. Dey don'
nobody live dyar now, 'cep' niggers. Arfter de war some one or nudder bought our place, but
his name done kind o' slipped me. I nuvver hearn on 'im befo'; I think dey's half-strainers.
I don' ax none on 'em no odds. I lives down de road heah, a little piece, an' I jes' steps
down of a evenin' and looks arfter de graves."

"Well, where is Marse Chan?" I asked.

"Hi! don' you know? Marse Chan, he went in de army. I wuz wid 'im. Yo' know he warn' gwine
an' lef' Sam."

"Will you tell me all about it?" I said, dismounting.

Instantly, and as if by instinct, the darkey stepped forward and took my bridle. I demurred
a little; but with a bow that would have honored old Sir Roger, he shortened the reins, and
taking my horse from me, led him along.

"Now tell me about Marse Chan," I said.

"Lawd, marster, hit's so long ago, I'd a'most forgit all about it, ef I hedn' been wid him
ever sence he wuz born. Ez 'tis, I remembers it jes' like 'twuz yistiddy. Yo' know Marse Chan
an' me--we wuz boys togedder. I wuz older'n he wuz, jes' de same ez he wuz whiter'n me. I wuz
born plantin' corn time, de spring arfter big Jim an' de six steers got washed away at de upper
ford right down dyar b'low de quarters ez he wuz a bringin' de Chris'mas things home; an' Marse
Chan, he warn' born tell mos' to der harves' arfter my sister Nancy married Cun'l Chahmb'lin's
Torm, 'bout eight years arfterwards.

"Well, when Marse Chan wuz born dey wuz de grettes' doin's at home you ever did see. De folks
all hed holiday, jes' like in de Chris'mas. Ole marster (we didn' call 'im ole marster tell
arfter Marse Chan wuz born--befo' dat he wuz jes' de marster, so)--well, ole marster, his face
fyar shine wid pleasure, an' all de folks wuz mighty glad, too, 'cause dey all loved ole marster,
and aldo' dey did step aroun' right peart when ole marster wuz lookin' at 'em, dyar warn' nyar
han' on de place but what, ef he wanted anythin', would walk up to de back poach, an' say he
warn' to see de marster. An' ev'ybody wuz talkin' 'bout de young marster, an' de maids an'
de wimmens 'bout de kitchen wuz sayin' how 'twuz de purties' chile dey ever see; an' at dinner-time
de mens (all on 'em hed holiday) come roun' de poach an' ax how de missis an' de young marster
wuz, an' ole marster come out on de poach an' smile wus'n a 'possum, an' sez, 'Thankee! Bofe
doin' fust rate, boys;' an' den he stepped back in de house, sort o' laughin' to hisse'f, an'
in a minute he come out ag'in wid de baby in he arms, all wrapped up in flannens an' things,
an' sez, 'Heah he is, boys.' All de folks den, dey went up on de poach to look at 'im, drappin'
dey hats on de steps, an' scrapin' dey feets ez dey went up. An' pres'n'y ole marster, lookin'
down at we all chil'en all packed togedder down deah like a parecel o' sheep-burrs, cotch sight
o' me (he knowed my name, 'cause I use' to hole he hoss fur 'im sometimes; but he didn' know
all de chil'en by name, dey wuz so many on 'em), an' he sez, 'Come up heah.' So up I goes tippin',
skeered like, an' old marster sez, 'Ain' you Mymie's son?' 'Yass, seh,' sez I. 'Well,' sez
he, 'I'm gwine to give you to yo' young Marse Channin' to be his body-servant,' an' he put
de baby right in my arms (it's de truth I'm tellin' you!), an' yo' jes' ought to a-heard de
folks sayin', 'Lawd! marster, dat boy'll drap dat chile!' 'Naw, he won't,' sez marster; 'I
kin trust 'im.' And den he sez: 'Now, Sam, from dis time you belong to yo' young Marse Channin';
I wan' you to tek keer on 'im ez long ez he lives. You are to be his boy from dis time. An'
now,' he sez, 'carry 'im in de house.' An' he walks arfter me an' opens de do's fur me, an'
I kyars 'im in my arms, an' lays 'im down on de bed. An' from dat time I wuz tooken in de house
to be Marse Channin's body-servant.

"Well, you nuvver see a chile grow so. Pres'n'y he growed up right big, an' ole marster sez
he must have some edication. So he sont 'im to school to ole Miss Lawry down dyar, dis side
o' Cun'l Chahmb'lin's, an' I use' to go 'long wid 'im an' tote he books an' we all's snacks;
an' when he larnt to read an' spell right good, an' got 'bout so-o big, old Miss Lawry she
died, an' ole marster said he mus' have a man to teach 'im an' trounce 'im. So we all went
to Mr. Hall, whar kep' de school-house beyant de creek, an' dyar we went ev'y day, 'cep' Sat'd'ys
of co'se, an' sich days ez Marse Chan din' warn' go, an' ole missis begged 'im off.

"Hit wuz down dyar Marse Chan fust took notice o' Miss Anne. Mr. Hall, he taught gals ez well
ez boys, an' Cun'l Chahmb'lin he sont his daughter (dat's Miss Anne I'm talkin' about). She
wuz a leetle bit o' gal when she fust come. Yo' see, her ma wuz dead, an' ole Miss Lucy Chahmb'lin,
she lived wid her brudder an' kep' house for 'im; an' he wuz so busy wid politics, he didn'
have much time to spyar, so he sont Miss Anne to Mr. Hall's by a 'ooman wid a note. When she
come dat day in de school-house, an' all de chil'en looked at her so hard, she tu'n right red,
an' tried to pull her long curls over her eyes, an' den put bofe de backs of her little han's
in her two eyes, an' begin to cry to herse'f. Marse Chan he was settin' on de een' o' de bench
nigh de do', an' he jes' reached out an' put he arm roun' her an' drawed her up to 'im. An'
he kep' whisperin' to her, an' callin' her name, an' coddlin' her; an' pres'n'y she took her
han's down an' begin to laugh.

"Well, dey 'peared to tek' a gre't fancy to each udder from dat time. Miss Anne she warn' nuthin'
but a baby hardly, an' Marse Chan he wuz a good big boy 'bout mos' thirteen years ole, I reckon.
Hows'ever, dey sut'n'y wuz sot on each udder an' (yo' heah me!) ole marster an' Cun'l Chahmb'lin
dey 'peared to like it 'bout well ez de chil'en. Yo' see Cun'l Chahmb'lin's place j'ined ourn,
an' it looked jes' ez natural fur dem two chil'en to marry an' mek it one plantation, ez it
did fur de creek to run down de bottom from our place into Cun'l Chahmb'lin's. I don' rightly
think de chil'en thought 'bout gittin' married, not den, no mo'n I thought 'bout marryin' Judy
when she wuz a little gal at Cun'l Chahmb'lin's, runnin' 'bout de house, huntin' fur Miss Lucy's
spectacles; but dey wuz good frien's from de start. Marse Chan he use' to kyar Miss Anne's
books fur her ev'y day, an' ef de road wuz muddy or she wuz tired, he use' to tote her; an'
'twarn' hardly a day passed dat he didn' kyar her some'n' to school--apples or hick'y nuts,
or some'n'. He wouldn' let none o' de chil'en tease her, nudder. Heh! One day, one o' de boys
poked he finger at Miss Anne, an' arfter school Marse Chan he axed 'im 'roun' hine de school-house
out o' sight, an' ef he didn' whop 'im!

"Marse Chan, he wuz de peartes' scholar ole Mr. Hall hed, an' Mr. Hall he wuz mighty proud
o' 'im. I don' think he use' to beat 'im ez much ez he did de udders, aldo' he wuz de head
in all debilment dat went on, jes' ez he wuz in sayin' he lessons.

"Heh! one day in summer, jes' 'fo' de school broke up, dyah come up a storm right sudden, an'
riz de creek (dat one yo' cross' back yonder), an' Marse Chan he toted Miss Anne home on he
back. He ve'y off'n did dat when de parf wuz muddy. But dis day when dey come to de creek,
it had done washed all de logs 'way. 'Twuz still mighty high, so Marse Chan he put Miss Anne
down, an' he took a pole an' waded right in. Hit took 'im long up to de shoulders. Den he waded
back, an' took Miss Anne up on his head an' kyar'd her right over. At fust she wuz skeered;
but he tol' her he could swim an' wouldn' let her git hu't, an' den she let 'im kyar her 'cross,
she hol'in' his han's. I warn' 'long dat day, but he sut'n'y did dat thing.

"Ole marster he wuz so pleased 'bout it, he giv' Marse Chan a pony; an' Marse Chan rode 'im
to school de day arfter he come, so proud, an' sayin' how he wuz gwine to let Anne ride behine
'im; an' when he come home dat evenin' he wuz walkin'. 'Hi! where's yo' pony?' said ole marster.
'I give 'im to Anne,' says Marse Chan. 'She liked 'im, an'--I kin walk.' 'Yes,' sez ole marster,
laughin', 'I s'pose you's already done giv' her yo'se'f, an' nex' thing I know you'll be givin'
her this plantation and all my niggers.'

"Well, about a fortnight or sich a matter arfter dat, Cun'l Chahmb'lin sont over an' invited
all o' we all over to dinner, an' Marse Chan wuz 'spressly named in de note whar Ned brought;
an' arfter dinner he made ole Phil, whar wuz his ker'ige-driver, bring roun' Marse Chan's pony
wid a little side-saddle on 'im, an' a beautiful little hoss wid a bran'-new saddle an' bridle
on 'im; an' he gits up an' meks Marse Chan a gre't speech, an' presents 'im de little hoss;
an' den he calls Miss Anne, an' she comes out on de poach in a little ridin' frock, an' dey
puts her on her pony, an' Marse Chan mounts his hoss, an' dey goes to ride, while de grown
folks is a-laughin' an' chattin' an' smokin' dey cigars.

"Dem wuz good ole times, marster--de bes' Sam ever see! Dey wuz, in fac'! Niggers didn' hed
nothin' 't all to do--jes' hed to 'ten' to de feedin', an' cleanin' de hosses, an' doin' what
de marster tell 'em to do; an' when dey wuz sick, dey had things sont 'em out de house, an'
de same doctor come to see 'em whar 'ten' to de white folks when dey wuz po'ly. Dyar warn'
no trouble nor nothin'.

"Well, things tuk a change arfter dat. Marse Chan he went to de bo'din' school, whar he use'
to write to me constant. Ole missis use' to read me de letters, an' den I'd git Miss Anne to
read 'em ag'in to me when I'd see her. He use' to write to her too, an' she use' to write to
him too. Den Miss Anne she wuz sont off to school too. An' in de summer time dey'd bofe come
home, an' yo' hardly knowed whether Marse Chan lived at home or over at Cun'l Chahmb'lin's.
He wuz over dyah constant. 'Twuz always ridin' or fishin' down dyah, in de river; or sometimes
he' go over dyah, an' 'im an' she'd go out an' set in de yard onder de trees; she settin' up
mekin' out she wuz knittin' some sort o' bright-cullored some'n', wid de grarss growin' all
up 'g'inst her, an' her hat th'owed back on her neck, an' he readin' to her out books; an'
sometimes dey'd bofe read out de same book, fust one an' den todder. I use' to see 'em! Dat
wuz when dey wuz growin' up like.

"Den ole marster he run for Congress, an' ole Cun'l Chahmb'lin he wuz put up to run 'g'inst
ole marster by de Dimicrats; but ole marster he beat 'im. Yo' know he wuz gwine do dat! Co'se
he wuz! Dat made ole Cun'l Chahmb'lin mighty mad, and dey stopt visitin' each udder reg'lar,
like dey had been doin' all 'long. Den Cun'l Chahmb'lin he sort o' got in debt, an' sell some
o' he niggers, an' dat's de way de fuss begun. Dat's whar de lawsuit cum from. Ole marster
he didn' like nobody to sell niggers, an' knowin' dat Cun'l Chahmb'lin wuz sellin' o' his,
he writ an' offered to buy his M'ria an' all her chil'en, 'cause she hed married our Zeek'yel.
An' don' yo' t'ink, Cun'l Chahmb'lin axed ole marster mo' 'n th'ee niggers wuz wuth fur M'ria.
Befo' old marster bought her, dough, de sheriff cum an' levelled on M'ria an' a whole parecel
o' udder niggers. Ole marster he went to de sale, an' bid for 'em; but Cun'l Chahmb'lin he
got some one to bid 'g'inst ole marster. Dey wuz knocked out to ole marster dough, an' den
dey hed a big lawsuit, an' ole marster wuz agwine to co't, off an' on, fur some years, till
at lars' de co't decided dat M'ria belonged to ole marster. Ole Cun'l Chahmb'lin den wuz so
mad he sued ole marster for a little strip o' lan' down dyah on de line fence, whar he said
belonged to 'im. Ev'ybody knowed hit belonged to ole marster. Ef yo' go down dyah now, I kin
show it to yo', inside de line fence, whar it hed done bin ever since long befo' ole marster
wuz born. But Cun'l Chahmb'lin wuz a mons'us perseverin' man, an' ole marster he wouldn' let
nobody run over 'im. No, dat he wouldn'! So dey wuz agwine down to co't about dat, fur I don'
know how long, till ole marster beat 'im.

"All dis time, yo' know, Marse Chan wuz a-goin' back'ads an' for'ads to college, an' wuz growed
up a ve'y fine young man. He wuz a ve'y likely gent'man! Miss Anne she hed done mos' growed
up, too--wuz puttin' her hyar up like ole missis use' to put hers up, an' 'twuz jes' ez bright
ez de sorrel's mane when de sun cotch on it, an' her eyes wuz gre't big dark eyes, like her
pa's, on'y bigger an' not so fierce, an' 'twarn' none o' de young ladies ez purty ez she wuz.
She an' Marse Chan still set a heap o' sto' by one 'nudder, but I don' t'ink dey wuz easy wid
each udder ez when he used to tote her home from school on his back. Marse Chan he use' to
love de ve'y groun' she walked on, dough, in my 'pinion. Heh! His face 'twould light up whenever
she come into chu'ch, or anywhere, jes' like de sun hed come th'oo a chink on it suddenly.

"Den ole marster lost he eyes. D' yo' ever hyah 'bout dat? Heish! Didn' yo'? Well, one night
de big barn cotch fire. De stables, yo' know, wuz under de big barn, an' all de hosses wuz
in dyah. Hit 'peared to me like 'twarn' no time befo' all de folks an' de neighbors dey come,
an' dey wuz a-totin' water, an' a-tryin' to save de po' critters, an' dey got a heap on 'em
out; but de ker'ige-hosses dey wouldn' come out, an' dey wuz a-runnin' back'ads an' for'ads
inside de stalls, a-nikerin' an' a-screamin', like dey knowed dey time hed come. Yo' could
heah 'em so pitiful, an' pres'n'y ole marster said to Ham Fisher (he wuz de ker'ige-driver),
'Go in dyah an' try to save 'em; don' let 'em bu'n to death.' An' Ham he went right in. An'
jes' arfter he got in, de shed whar it hed fus' cotch fell in, an' de sparks shot 'way up in
de air; an' Ham didn' come back, an' de fire begun to lick out under de eaves over whar de
ker'ige-hosses' stalls wuz, an' all of a sudden ole marster tu'ned and kissed ole missis, who
wuz standin' nigh him, wid her face jes' ez white ez a sperit's, an', befo' anybody knowed
what he wuz gwine do, jumped right in de do', an' de smoke come po'in' out behine 'im. Well,
seh, I nuvver 'specks to hyah tell Judgment sich a soun' ez de folks set up. Ole missis she
jes' drapt down on her knees in de mud an' prayed out loud. Hit 'peared like her pra'r wuz
heard; for in a minit, right out de same do', kyarin' Ham Fisher in his arms, come ole marster,
wid his clo'es all blazin'. Dey flung water on 'im, an' put 'im out; an', ef you b'lieve me,
yo' wouldn' a-knowed 'twuz ole marster. Yo' see, he hed find Ham Fisher done fall down in de
smoke right by de ker'ige-hoss' stalls, whar he sont him, an' he hed to tote 'im back in his
arms th'oo de fire what hed done cotch de front part o' de stable, an' to keep de flame from
gittin' down Ham Fisher's th'ote he hed tuk off his own hat and mashed it all over Ham Fisher's
face, an' he hed kep' Ham Fisher from bein' so much bu'nt; but he wuz bu'nt dreadful! His beard
an' hyar wuz all nyawed off, an' his face an' han's an' neck wuz scorified terrible. Well,
he jes' laid Ham Fisher down, an' then he kind o' staggered for'ad, an' ole missis ketch' 'im
in her arms. Ham Fisher, he warnt bu'nt so bad, an' he got out in a month or two; an' arfter
a long time, ole marster he got well, too; but he wuz always stone bline arfter dat. He nuvver
could see none from dat night.

"Marse Chan he comed home from college toreckly, an' he sut'n'y did nuss ole marster faithful--jes'
like a 'ooman. Den he took charge o' de plantation arfter dat; an' I use' to wait on 'im jes'
like when we wuz boys togedder; an' sometimes we'd slip off an' have a fox-hunt, an' he'd be
jes' like he wuz in ole times, befo' ole marster got bline, an' Miss Anne Chahmb'lin stopt
comin' over to our house, an' settin' onder de trees, readin' out de same book.

"He sut'n'y wuz good to me. Nothin' nuvver made no diffunce 'bout dat. He nuvver hit me a lick
in his life--an' nuvver let nobody else do it, nudder.

"I 'members one day, when he wuz a leetle bit o' boy, ole marster hed done tole we all chil'en
not to slide on de straw-stacks; an' one day me an' Marse Chan thought ole marster hed done
gone 'way from home. We watched him git on he hoss an' ride up de road out o' sight, an' we
wuz out in de field a-slidin' an' a-slidin', when up comes ole marster. We started to run;
but he hed done see us, an' he called us to come back; an' sich a whoppin' ez he did gi' us!

"Fust he took Marse Chan, an' den he teched me up. He nuvver hu't me, but in co'se I wuz a-hollerin'
ez hard ez I could stave it, 'cause I knowed dat wuz gwine mek him stop. Marse Chan he hed'n
open he mouf long ez ole marster wuz tunin' 'im; but soon ez he commence warmin' me an' I begin
to holler, Marse Chan he bu'st out cryin', an' stept right in befo' ole marster, an' ketchin'
de whop, sed:

"'Stop, seh! Yo' sha'n't whop 'im; he b'longs to me, an' ef you hit 'im another lick I'll set
'im free!'

"I wish yo' hed see ole marster. Marse Chan he warn' mo'n eight years ole, an' dyah dey wuz--ole
marster stan'in' wid he whop raised up, an' Marse Chan red an' cryin', hol'in' on to it, an'
sayin' I b'longst to 'im.

"Ole marster, he raise' de whop, an' den he drapt it, an' broke out in a smile over he face,
an' he chuck' Marse Chan onder der chin, an' tu'n right roun' an' went away, laughin' to hisse'f,
an' I heah' 'im tellin' ole missis dat evenin', an' laughin' 'bout it.

"'Twan' so mighty long arfter dat when dey fust got to talkin' 'bout de war. Dey wuz a-dictatin'
back'ads an' for'ads 'bout it fur two or th'ee years 'fo' it come sho' nuff, you know. Ole
marster, he wuz a Whig, an' of co'se Marse Chan he tuk after he pa. Cun'l Chahmb'lin, he wuz
a Dimicrat. He wuz in favor of de war, an' ole marster and Marse Chan dey wuz agin' it. Dey
wuz a-talkin' 'bout it all de time, an' purty soon Cun'l Chahmb'lin he went about ev'vywhar
speakin' an' noratin' 'bout Firginia ought to secede; an' Marse Chan he wuz picked up to talk
agin' 'im. Dat wuz de way dey come to fight de duil. I sut'n'y wuz skeered fur Marse Chan dat
mawnin', an' he was jes' ez cool! Yo' see, it happen so: Marse Chan he wuz a-speakin' down
at de Deep Creek Tavern, an' he kind o' got de bes' of ole Cun'l Chahmb'lin. All de white folks
laughed an' hoorawed, an' ole Cun'l Chahmb'lin--my Lawd! I t'ought he'd 'a' bu'st, he wuz so
mad. Well, when it come to his time to speak, he jes' light into Marse Chan. He call 'im a
traitor, an' a ab'litionis', an' I don' know what all. Marse Chan, he jes' kep' cool till de
ole Cun'l light into he pa. Ez soon ez he name ole marster, I seen Marse Chan sort o' lif'
up he head. D' yo' ever see a hoss rar he head up right sudden at night when he see somethin'
comin' to'ds 'im from de side an' he don' know what 'tis? Ole Cun'l Chahmb'lin, he went right
on. He said ole marster hed taught Marse Chan; dat ole marster wuz a wuss ab'litionis' dan
he son. I looked at Marse Chan, an' sez to myse'f: 'Fo' Gord! old Cun'l Chahmb'lin better min',
an' I hedn' got de wuds out, when ole Cun'l Chahmb'lin 'cuse' ole marster o' cheatin' 'im out
o' he niggers, an' stealin' piece o' he lan'--dat's de lan' I tole you 'bout. Well, seh, nex'
thing I knowed, I heahed Marse Chan--hit all happen right 'long togedder, like lightnin' an'
thunder when dey hit right at you--I heah 'im say:

"'Cun'l Chahmb'lin, what you say is false, an' yo' know it to be so. You have wilfully slandered
one of the pures' an' nobles' men Gord ever made, an' nothin' but yo' gray hyars protects you.
