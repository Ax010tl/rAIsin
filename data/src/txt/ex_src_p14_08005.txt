"I seed many Yankees during de war in Alabama. When de war ended dey tole me I wuz free. I
wuz so glad I didn' know whut to do. De Yankees tole me I wuz free. I went wid 'em. I stayed
wid 'em from May till August. Den I slipped away from 'em. I had no clothes and shoes till
de Yankees come. Yes, Sir, I went barefooted. Dey gimme clothes and shoes, but I slipped away
from 'em because dey wanted me to do things I didn' want to do.

"White folks, if I must tell you, I must. I think Jesus sent you to me so I can tell my story.
Dey just wanted me to forage aroun' and git chickens, collards, taters en anybody's hogs I
could git. I didn' have no slips or shoes, no unner clothes for 40 years befo' de Yankees come,
but I slipped away. I didn' want to do what dey wanted me t'do.

"De pore white folks done tolerable well but de rich slave owners didn' 'low 'em to come on
dere plantations. Dey didn' 'low free niggers to come on de plantations if dey could help it,
but dey couldn' hep it. Dey slipped in dere at night when de marster didn' know it.

"My marster owned three plantations and 300 slaves. He started out wid 2 'oman slaves and raised
300 slaves. One wuz called short Peggy, and the udder wuz called long Peggy. Long Peggy had
25 chillun. Long Peggy, a black 'oman, wuz boss ob de plantation. Marster freed her atter she
had 25 chilluns, just think o' dat, raisin' 300 slaves wid two 'omans. It sho is de truf do'.

"There wuz no jails but dey had whippin' pos' on de plantations. When a nigger done anything
he wuz tied and whupped, dare ain't no scars on my back, no nary a one. Dere wuz slave auction
blocks at Rolesville, en down to Rosinburg, Harpsborough, below Zebulon, next place, Smithfield.

"White folks didn' hep me to read an' write. If I wuz caught wid a book I had better run an'
git in a hole somewhar. Dey didn' low me to hab nothing to do wid books.

"My marster preached to us on Sunday. He wuz a preacher. My marster preached to his slaves.
No slaves didn' run away from my marster. He wuz too good to 'em. De slaves from other places
run away do', an' when dey caught 'em dey whupped 'em too.

"Yes Sir, my marster gib us Christmas. Sometimes he gib us two weeks befo' we went to work
agin Christmas. Licker wuz no mo 'en water. Brandy, de highest price of any of it wuz 40 cts.
a gallon. We had a plenty uv licker, but nobody got drunk. Sometimes a white man got drunk
en now en den a nigger would git drunk.

"All worked for one an'er den. I tell you dis young bunch ain't right, dey don't do right,
dey don't work fer one an'er.

"I never married befo' de war. Nobody married on marster's plantation, but dey had 'omans.
My 'oman wuz mighty good to me. I slep' anywhar I could befo' de war ended, in de shuck pen,
cotton seed house, an' went barefooted in slavery days. I married Helen Jones atter de war.
I had four chilluns by her, 2 gals an' 2 boys. One o' dem boys is livin' now, but I doan know
whar he is. I had one child by my 'oman in slavery time. My 'oman died in Greene County Alabama.
I been married twice. I married another 'oman named Amy Gumpton in Wake County. She had four
chillun by me, one, a boy is in de navy yard, a girl in Brooklyn, New York, one in Wake County,
a farmer, an' one died. I lub de southern people, but de debbil got de bes' of 'em; dey wuz
good to me.

"I doan think Mr. Abraham Lincoln wuz a good man, no sir-ree, de debbil got him atter he whupped
and won all de lan'. He wanted to gib it back agin. De debbil got de bes' o' him. He didn'
lib long atter he whupped, did he?"

JOHN SMITH

10 Pettigrew St., Raleigh, N.C. Age 77.

"My mother was named Charlotte Smith and father was named Richmond Sanders. You know niggers
were sold an' traded an' given away just like stock, horses, mules an' de like in slavery time.

"My mother belonged to John Smith and father belonged to Richmond Sanders. I belonged first
to John Smith, but was give away when I was a child to Solomon Gardner. John Smith's plantation
was in Johnston County near Smithfield. Solomon Gardner's place was in Wake County. All these
people are dead an' gone. My uncle, Ben Thomas, died 'bout one month ago in Johnston County.
He was the last of the old gang. Mother and father said we got reasonably good food and clothes.
The houses were small and poorly furnished but were warm and they got on very well. There was
'bout twenty-five slaves on the place and they worked long hours under overseers.

"The rules were strict about books, goin' visiting an' having meetings of any kind. No slave
was allowed to carry guns or hunt without some white man with him unless his marster give him
a pass. Dey caught rabbits in gums, birds in traps an' hunted possums wid dogs at night. Dere
was not much time for fishin' cept at lay-by time and at de Fourth of July. Den slaves an'
whites sometime went fishin' in de Neuse River together. At Christmas de holidays was give
slaves and den dey had plenty to eat, shoes, etc.

"Slaves were sold at Smithfield on a auction block but a lot were carried to Richmond, Va.
and to Fayetteville, N.C. Children were not made to work till dey got 12 or 14 years old unless
it was some light work around de house, mindin' de table, fannin' flies, an' pickin' up chips
to start a fire, scratchin' marster's head so he could sleep in de evenings an' washin' missus
feet at night 'fore she went to bed. Some of de missus had nigger servants to bathe 'em, wash
dere feet an' fix dere hair. When one nigger would wash de missus feet dare would be another
slave standin' dere wid a towel to dry 'em for her. Some of dese missus atter de war died poor.
Before dey died dey went from place to place livin' on de charity of dere friends.

"I was born 2nd Sunday in May 1860. I remember seein' de Yankees but I know very little 'bout
'em. Guess mos' all dem Yankees are dead now. De ones dat whupped an' de ones dat got whupped
are mos' all dead. I lerned to read an' write since slavery. I remember de Yankees. Dey give
us chilluns hardtack. Dey had cans on dere backs an' guns, blue clothes an' brass buttons on
dere clothes. Dey had covered wagons in front an' dey was walkin'. I remember seein' dem kill
a hog and take part of de hog an' carry it off on dere backs.

"De only time I saw anything in de slave situation dat made a big impression on my mind was
when Marster Thomas tied my Aunt Anne Thomas to a peach tree and whupped her. I will never
forgit how she cried. Another thing I 'members, my uncle teached me to cuss folks. His name
was Needum Thomas. I can remember fore I could walk better than I can remember happenings now.

"Atter de war my daddy took mother an' moved to Dr. Leach's in Wake County, next year we went
to Mrs. Betsy Jordan's plantation in Johnston County. The fourth year atter the war they put
me to work. We stayed with the Jordans several years then we moved to Mr. Thomas' where my
aunt was whupped in slavery time an' de marster dat owned some of our people in slavery time.
We stayed there a few years. Then we moved to John Avery's near Smithfield. Father bought a
place there an' paid for it.

"Father believed in whuppin like de white folks did. He cut de blood out of me wid a switch
an' scarred me up an' I left him. When I was twenty-one, a free man, I went back an' paid father
for every day I was away from him from de time I ran away at 16 years old till I was twenty-one.
I owed him dat 'cause I was his until I was free. I believes dat is why God has allowed me
to live such a long time, 'cause I paid a just debt. Daddy said before he died I had done more
for him dan de other chilluns. He whupped me too much but atter all he was my father an' I
loved him an' paid him all I owed him for de time I was away.

"I married three times in Raleigh. I married Juliva Smith, she lived one and one half years.
We had one child dat lived six days. I have no more chilluns. I married Mahalda Rand. She lived
a year and three months and the third an' last time I married Maggie Taylor. I lived with her
eleven years an' she died. I am single now.

"Haywood Smith was my first father-in-law. He is 'bout 108 years ole. He lives at de County home.

"I am livin' right in dis world tryin' to be ready when God calls me. Slavery was bad. Workin'
the colored people over two hundred years without giving 'em anything but dere food an' clothes.
Yes slavery was bad."

JOSEPHINE SMITH Ex-Slave Story

An interview with Josephine Smith, 94 years old of 1010 Mark Street, Raleigh, N.C.

"I wuz borned in Norfolk, Virginia an' I doan know who we belonged to, but I 'members de day
we wuz put on de block at Richmond. I wuz jist todlin' roun' den, but me an' my mammy brought
a thousand dollars. My daddy, I reckon, belonged ter somebody else, an' we wuz jist sold away
from him jist lak de cow is sold away from de bull.

"A preacher by de name of Maynard bought me an' mammy an' carried us ter Franklinton, whar
we lived till his daughter married Doctor John Leach of Johnston County; den I wuz give ter her.

"All my white folkses wuz good ter me, an' I reckon dat I ain't got no cause fer complaint.
I ain't had much clothes, an' I ain't had so much ter eat, an' a many a whuppin', but nobody
ain't nebber been real bad ter me.

"I 'members seein' a heap o' slave sales, wid de niggers in chains, an' de spec'ulators sellin'
an' buyin' dem off. I also 'members seein' a drove of slaves wid nothin' on but a rag 'twixt
dere legs bein' galloped roun' 'fore de buyers. 'Bout de wust thing dat eber I seed do' wuz
a slave 'oman at Louisburg who had been sold off from her three weeks old baby, an' wuz bein'
marched ter New Orleans.

"She had walked till she wuz give out, an' she wuz weak enough ter fall in de middle o' de
road. She wuz chained wid twenty or thirty other slaves an' dey stopped ter rest in de shade
o' a big oak while de speculators et dere dinner. De slaves ain't havin' no dinner. As I pass
by dis 'oman begs me in God's name fer a drink o' water, an' I gives it ter her. I ain't neber
be so sorry fer nobody.

"Hit wuz in de mont' of August an' de sun wuz bearin' down hot when de slaves an' dere drivers
leave de shade. Dey walk fer a little piece an' dis 'oman fall out. She dies dar side o' de
road, an' right dar dey buries her, cussin', dey tells me, 'bout losin' money on her.

"Atter de war I comes ter Raleigh an' wucks fer Major Russ den I cooks a year on Hillsboro
Street fer somebody who I can' 'member right now, den I goes ter Louisburg ter cook in Mr.
Dedman's hotel, an' hearin' 'bout Melissa I fin's dat she am my sister, so I goes ter Mis'
Mitchel's an' I gits her.

"A few years atter de war I marries Alex. Dunson wuz a body slave fer Major Fernie Green an'
went through all de war. Me an' him lived tergether sixty years, I reckon, an' he died de night
'fore Thanksgivin' in 1923.

"Slavery wuzn't so good, case it divided famblies an' done a heap o' other things dat wuz bad,
but de wuck wuz good fer ever'body. It's a pity dat dese youngins nowadays doan know de value
o' wuck lak we did. Why when I wuz ten years old I could do any kind o' house wuck an' spin
an' weave ter boot. I hope dat dese chilluns will larn somethin' in school an' church. Dats
de only way dey can larn it."

NELLIE SMITH

Main St. Dunn, North Carolina Route 6

"My name is Nellie Smith. I wus born on a plantation in Harnett County in 1856, near where
Linden now stands. I belonged to ole man Jack Williams. His wife wus dead when I wus borned.
There were many acres in the plantation; it wus a large one. I don't know exactly how many
acres. There were 'bout fifty slaves on the place. The slave houses were on a hill. Marster
lived in the big house; and it wus a big one too.

"I do not remember ever goin' hongry when I wus a slave. Father wus the butler and mother wus
a house woman, and we got plenty to eat. My mother wus named Rosetta Williams and father wus
named Atlas Williams. I do not remember my grandmother and grandfather, but I remember my great
grandmother.

"We had good home made clothes and good beds. Jack Williams wus good to his slaves. He wus
good to me and my mother and father, I have heard 'em say that he wus always good to 'em. Our
livin' with him wus good and we loved him. He thought a lot o' his niggers. He had six children
of his own 4 boys and 2 girls; the boys Dr. Jack Williams, Dr. Jim Williams, William Williams,
Jim Williams; the girls Mary and Martha.

"I did little work in slavery time. Sometimes I fanned flies off the table at meal times and
did other light work. They made children do very little work in slavery time. We children played
base, an' hide the switch.

"I saw a jail for slaves in Fayetteville, North Carolina, but I never saw a slave sold. I saw
an overseer whup a man once but he certainly didn't hurt him much. He done more talkin' dan
whuppin.

"We went to the white folks' church but they would not allow any of us any books. No one taught
us to read an' write. My father ran away once because he would not take a whuppin'. When he
came back they did not do or say anything to 'im. Jack Williams would not allow a patteroller
to whup a nigger on his land. If they could git on his land dey were safe. He had overseers
at the plantation. I remember one whose name wus Buck Buckannon. When we got sick Dr. Jack
Williams looked after us. When Marster Jim Williams got to be a doctor he looked after us.

"Yes, I remember de Yankees. Dey went to our house one Sunday mornin'. Dey did not fight on
our side of the river; dey fought on de other side o' de river near de Smith House. It wus
the battle of Averysboro. De Smith House wus a hospital. Dey came into the house, my sister
Irene wus house girl. The Yankees put deir pistols to her head and said, 'You better tell me
where dem things are hid. Tell us where de money and silver is hid at.' Sister did not tell.
Boss had started off wid de silver dat mornin'. De Yankees caught him, took it, an' his boots,
horse and all he had. He come back home barefooted. Dey got mos' everthing at Marster's house.
Dey took my mother's shawl, an' a lot of things belongin' to de slaves.

"I have heard o' de Ku Klux Klan, ha! ha! Yes, I have. I heard tell of dey beatin' up people,
but I never got into any tangle wid 'em. I just don't know bout all dem old folks Lincoln,
Davis, Booker Washington. I think slavery wus a bad thing cause dey sold families apart, fathers
from their wives and children, and mothers away from their children. Two of my sisters were
fixed up to be sold when the war ended."

"I wus borned January 22, 1858 ter Martha an' Green Womble in Chatham County, near Lockville.
My father 'longed ter Mr. John Womble an' mammy 'longed ter Captain Elias Bryant. Dey had six
chilluns, I bein' nex' ter de oldes'.

"Father wus a carpenter an' by his havin' a trade he got along better before an' atter de war
dan de other niggers. Mammy wus housekeeper an' cook an' she always wus neat as a pin an' as
quick as lightnin'. Both families wus good ter dere slaves, givin' dem plenty ter eat an' enough
ter wear.

"I stayed wid mammy on Captain Bryant's plantation, an' I doan 'member doin' any wurk at all
'cept lookin' atter de babies onct in a long while.

"When de Yankees come Marse wus off ter de war so dey tuck de place wid out any trouble at
all. Dey wusn't as good ter us as our white folkses wus an' somehow we doan feel right 'bout
'em takin' Marse's stuff, but we knows hit ain't no use ter say nothin' 'bout hit.

"At last de war wus ober, de Captain wus too busted ter hire us ter stay on, so we moved over
ter Mr. Womble's place den.

"Life wus a heap different from what hit wus 'fore de surrender. We ain't had no fun now case
when we has time we is too tired an' when we do have time is soldom. No mo' dances an' parties
fer us. We ain't eben got de 'lasses ter have a candy pullin'. We ain't got de 'ligion we had
'fore de war, so prayer meetin' am not hilt often. De Yankees gived us a school but dey ain't
give us nothin' ter eat so we's got ter wurk, we ain't got no time fer edgercation.

"I growed up in dis han' mouth way an' when I wus thirteen I seed Henry Smith who wus rentin'
a little farm dar near us. He wus young an' slim an' yaller. My folks wanted me ter marry Bill
Bunn but he wus thirty-odd, black an' heavy, an' I ain't laked him.

remember how many children they had but one or two o' 'em are living in Raleigh now, some place
on North Street. I had good food and clothing and a good place to sleep. I was not big enough
to work much but they were good to me. I jest done little things aroun' the house.

"I remember seein' the Yankees. I seen 'em take things. Yes, I wus big enough to see 'em shoot
hogs, an' cows, an' kill the chickens. They went through the house and took what they wanted.
After the war we moved over about the Asylum on the Haywood Place. We went to Bryant Green's

"I stayed in Arkansas 40 years, and then came back to Raleigh. I am partly paralyzed. I have

grape fruit juice, one half pound coffee per week. This amounts to about eighty cents worth
rations per week. The charity don't have much to give.

"I have been back from Arkansas nine years the seventh of last April. I was never teached no

her mother's.

"My mammy, Virginia Burns, wus borned in Fayetteville, Cumberland County. She never knowed
her parents an' frum de fust she can 'member she is a bound girl.

"Frum de fust she could 'member she wus bound out ter a Mis' Frizelle what beat her, give her
scraps lak a dog, an' make her wuck lak a man. Dey eben makes her git on de well sweep an'
go down in de well an' clean hit out. She said dat she wus skeerd nigh ter death.

"She wus a grown woman when she 'cided dat she can't stand de treatment no mo'. She has cut
wood since she wus big enough ter pick up de axe an' she makes up her min' ter quit.

"Dey wus a-fixin' ter chain her up an' beat her lak dey usually done when she 'cides ter go

"Fust she runs ter de Marster's bedroom an' slips on a pair of his ole shoes, den she goes
out ter de big chicken house back of de barn. She hyars de Marster a-callin' fer her 'fore
she gits ter de woods so she runs back an' hides in de chicken house.

"Dey calls an' dey calls, an' de chickens comes ter de roost but she lays low an' doan make
no fuss, so dey goes on ter sleep. She hyars de folkses a-callin' her but she lays still, den
she sees de torches what dey am usein' ter find her an' she thanks God dat she ain't in de

Dey 'cides ter go home an' start out ag'in de nex' mornin' bright an' early.

"Mammy am skeerd pink but she knows dat unless she am keerful dey am gwine ter ketch her. She
lays still till daybreak den she flies fer de woods.

"I'se hyard mammy say dat dem nights she slept in de woods wus awful. She'd find a cave sometimes
an' den ag'in she'd sleep in a holler log, but she said dat ever'time de hoot owls holler or
de shiverin' owls shiver dat she'd cower down an' bite her tongue ter keep frum screamin'.

"She said dat de woods wus full of snakes an' hit wus near 'bout two weeks 'fore she got ter
Guilford County. She had stold what she et on de way dar, an' dat hadn't been much so she wus weak.

"One day she crept outen de woods an' look roun' her an' hit bein' in July, she spies a watermillion
patch. She looks roun' an' den flies out dar an' picks up a big million, den she shakes a leg
back ter de woods.

"While she wus settin' dar eatin' de watermillion a young white man comes up an' axes her her
business an' she, seein' dat he am kind-lookin', tells him her story.

"She fully 'specks him ter turn her ober ter de sheriff but 'stid of dat he tells her dat his

97 years old. 536 E. Edenton Street, Raleigh, N.C.

"I jist lak three years of bein' one hundred years old. I belonged to Jacob Sorrell. His wife
wus named Elizabeth. My age wus give to me by Mr. Bob Sorrell, the only one of ole marster's
chilluns dat is livin' now.

"Dey had four boys, Marcillers, Bob, Adolphus and Dr. Patrick Sorrell. Dey had three girls,
Averada an' two udder ones dat died 'fore dey wus named. I wus born on marster's plantation
near Leesville, in Wake County. Dats been a long time ago. I can't git around now lak I could
when I wus on de plantation.

"Dere wus 'bout twenty-five slaves on de place an' marster jist wouldn't sell a slave. When
he whupped one he didn't whup much, he wus a good man. He seemed to be sorry everytime he had
to whup any of de slaves. His wife wus de pure debil, she jist joyed whuppin' Negroes. She
wus tall an' spare-made wid black hair an' eyes. Over both her eyes wus a bulge place in her
forehead. Her eyes set way back in her head. Her jaws were large lak a man's an' her chin stuck
up. Her mouth wus large an' her lips thin an' seemed to be closed lak she had sumptin' in her
mouth most all de time.

"When marster come ter town she raised ole scratch wid de slaves. She whupped all she could
while marster wus gone. She tried to boss marster but he wouldn't allow dat. He kept her from
whuppin' many a slave. She jist wouldn't feed a slave an' when she had her way our food wus
bad. She said underleaves of collards wus good enough for slaves. Marster took feedin' in his
hands an' fed us plenty at times. He said people couldn't work widout eatin'.

"Our houses wus good houses, 'case marster seed to it dey wus fixed right. We had good beds
an' plenty of kiver. De houses wus called de nigger houses. Dey wus 'bout two hundred yards
from de big house. Our houses had two rooms an' marster's had seven rooms.

"We didn't have any overseers, marster said he didn't believe in 'em an' he didn't want any.
De oldest slaves on the place woke us up in the morning, an' acted as foreman. Marster hardly
ever went to de field. He tole Squire Holman an' Sam Sorrell, two ole slaves, what he wanted
done an' dey tole us an' we done it. I worked at de house as nurse an' house girl most of de time.

"Mother an' father worked in de field. Mother wus named Judy an' father wus named Sam. You
sees father wus a slave foreman. Marster bought Squire Holman from de Holmans an' let him keep
his name. Dats why he wus called dat.
