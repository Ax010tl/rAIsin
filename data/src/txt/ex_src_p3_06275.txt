  The Chinese Red Pine is found in warm-temperate climates. It is native
  to southeastern China and follows the valley of the Yangtse River into
  Szech'uan. It has been confused by London with P. pinaster, which it
  resembles in no respect, by Siebold with P. Thunbergii, from which it
  differs in leaf-dimensions and in leaf-section, and by Mayr with his
  P. luchuensis, whose peculiar cortex and whose leaf-section has no
  counterpart among Chinese Hard Pines. Its nearest relative is P.
  densiflora, from which it differs in its longer leaves, in the color
  of its cone and in its conelet (Plate XX, figs. 176, 179).

    1854 P. scopifera Miquel in Zollinger, Syst. Verz. Ind. Archip. 82.

Spring-shoots more or less pruinose, uninodal. Scales of the conelet conspicuously mucronate.
Cones symmetrical, from 3 to 5 cm. long, ovate-conic, often persistent for a few years but
with a weak hold on the branch; apophyses dull pale tawny yellow, flat or slightly elevated,
the mucro more or less persistent.

  The Japanese Red Pine forms extensive forests on the mountains of
  central Japan. It is perfectly hardy in cold-temperate climates. Wild
  specimens of China, ascribed to this species, are forms of the
  variable P. sinensis. From P. Massoniana it differs in its shorter
  leaves and yellow cone, but particularly in the more prominent
  prickles and thicker scales of its conelet (figs. 176, 179).

    1859 P. Frieseana Wichura in Flora, xlii. 409.
    1906 P. lapponica Mayr, Fremdl. Wald- & Parkb. 348.

Spring-shoots uninodal. Leaves binate, from 3 to 7 cm. long; hypoderm inconspicuous; resin-ducts
external. Conelet reflexed, minutely mucronate. Cones from 3 to 6 cm. long, reflexed, symmetrical
or sometimes oblique, ovate-conic, deciduous; apophyses dull pale tawny yellow of a gray or
greenish shade, flat, elevated or protuberant and often much more prominent on the posterior
face of the cone, the umbo with a minute prickle or its remnant.

  A tree of great commercial value, with a very extended range, from
  Norway, Scotland and southern Spain to northeastern Siberia. A
  vigorous hardy species and extensively cultivated. The red upper
  trunk, characteristic of this Pine, is not invariable. The dark upper
  trunk is sufficiently common to be considered a varietal form
  (Mathieu, Flore Forest. ed. 4, 582). In various localities may be
  found trees bearing oblique cones, their apophyses showing various
  degrees of protuberance up to the extreme development represented in
  Loudon's illustration of the variety uncinata (Arb. Brit. iv, f.
  2047). This cone is the beginning of the changes that culminate in
  species with oblique cones only. In P. sylvestris, however, the
  purpose of this form of cone is not apparent except in connection with
  this evolution.

    1837 P. uliginosa Neumann ex Wimmer, Arb. Schles. Ges. 95.

Spring-shoots uninodal. Leaves binate, from 3 to 8 cm. long, the epiderm very thick, hypoderm
weak; resin-ducts external. Conelets mucronate, nearly sessile. Cones from 2 to 7 cm. long,
subsessile, ovate or ovate-conic, symmetrical or oblique, often persistent; apophyses lustrous
tawny-yellow or dark brown, both colors often shading into each other on the same cone, flat,
prominent or prolonged into uncinate beaks of various lengths, the last much more developed
on the posterior face of the cone, the umbo bordered by a narrow dark ring and bearing the
remnant of the mucro.

  P. montana grows as a bush or as a small tree, the two forms often
  associated. It ranges from central Spain through the Pyrenees, Alps
  and Apennines to the Balkan Mountains, associated with P. cembra at
  higher, with P. sylvestris at lower altitudes. It grows indifferently
  in bogs and on rocky slopes. Its dwarf form, under the name of the
  Mugho Pine, is extensively cultivated as a garden ornament.

  On the differences of the cone this species has been divided into
  three subspecies: uncinata, with an oblique cone and protuberant
  apophyses; pumilio, with a symmetrical cone and an excentric umbo;
  mughus, with a symmetrical cone and a concentric umbo. Other
  segregations based on the degree of development of the apophysis and
  on the size and color of the cone, have received names of four or even
  five terms--Pinus montana pumilio applanata--or Pinus montana uncinata
  rostrata castanea etc., etc. These elaborations may be seen in the
  Tharand Jahrbuch of 1861, p. 166, and with them appear also Hartig's
  specifications of 60 forms of this species, each dignified with a
  Latin name.

31. PINUS LUCHUENSIS

1894 P. luchuensis Mayr in Bot. Centralbl. lviii. 149, f.

Spring-shoots uninodal. Bark-formation late, the upper trunk covered with a smooth cortex.
Leaves binate, from 12 to 16 cm. long, the epiderm thick, hypoderm of two or three rows of
cells; resin-ducts medial or with an occasional external duct. Conelets mucronate toward the
apex. Cones from 3 to 6 cm. long, ovate-conic, symmetrical; apophyses lustrous nut-brown, transversely
carinate, the umbo unarmed.

  This Pine is known to me through Mayr's description and a single dried
  specimen. The smooth cortex of young trees distinguishes it from all
  other east-Asiatic Hard Pines. Mayr includes under this species the
  Pine of Hong Kong. But in this he must be mistaken, for there is no
  species yet found in China that agrees with the description of P.
  luchuensis.

              (not Lambert).
    1868 P. Thunbergii Parlatore in DC. Prodr. xvi-2, 388.

Spring-shoots uninodal. Buds of leading-shoots white and conspicuous. Leaves binate, from 6
to 11 cm. long, the epiderm thick, hypoderm strong, resin-ducts medial. Conelets with short-mucronate
scales. Cones from 4 to 6 cm. long, ovate or ovate-conic, symmetrical; apophyses nut-brown,
flat or convex and transversely carinate, the prickle of the umbo more or less persistent.

  The Black Pine of Japan has been cultivated for centuries, and by
  skillful Japanese gardeners has been trained into dwarf and other
  curious forms. It is hardy in cold-temperate climates. It is distinct
  from P. densiflora by the medial ducts of its leaf, from P. nigra by
  the fewer, larger, brown scales of its cone, and from P. resinosa by
  the armature of its conelet. It appears in most determinations of
  Chinese collections, but there is no Chinese Pine with the white buds
  and the medial leaf-ducts of this species.

Spring-shoots uninodal. Leaves binate, from 9 to 16 cm. long, the epiderm thick, hypoderm conspicuous,
resin-ducts medial. Conelets mucronate. Cones from 4 to 8 cm. long, subsessile, symmetrical;
apophyses lustrous, tawny yellow, transversely carinate, the keel strongly convex, the mucro
of the umbo more or less persistent.

  A valuable tree unequally distributed over the mountain slopes of
  central and southern Europe and Asia Minor. The typical form, under
  the name of the Austrian Pine, is a familiar exotic of the Middle and
  Eastern States of America. As Mathieu states (Flore Forest., ed. 4,
  597), this species is quite constant in cone and bark. It may be added
  that the anatomy of the leaf is also constant, while the dimensions of
  both leaf and cone present no unusual variations. The varieties
  generally accepted are founded on the habit of the tree, a character
  of forestal or horticultural rather than of botanical importance.

    1847 P. Finlaysoniana Wallich ex Blume, Rumphia, iii. 210.
    1849 P. Latteri Mason in Jour. Asiat. Soc. i. 74.

Spring-shoots uninodal. Leaves binate, slender, from 15 to 20 cm. long, the hypoderm of uniform
thick-walled cells, resin-ducts medial, or with internal or septal ducts, endoderm-cells very
unequal in size, some of them large. Conelets unarmed. Cones from 5 to 8 cm. long, peculiarly
narrow-cylindrical, symmetrical; apophyses lustrous, rufous brown, radially carinate, the transverse
keel prominent.

  Of the habit of this Pine I know nothing. As a species it is very
  clearly defined by its peculiar cone and leaf-section. It grows in the
  Philippines, Sumatra, Lower Burmah and western Indo-China. In my
  specimen the pits of the ray-cells of the wood are both large and
  small. In this particular it may belong in either of two groups of
  species. Its uniform leaf-hypoderm associates it with this group or
  with P. halepensis of the Insignes. I have assumed the cone to be
  dehiscent at maturity and have placed it with the Lariciones, but if
  further information shows the cone to be serotinous, this species
  should be transferred to the serotinous group.

    1911 P. Wilsonii Shaw in Sargent, Pl. Wilson. i. 3.

Spring-shoots uninodal, pruinose. Leaves binate, ternate, or both, from 10 to 15 cm. long,
stout and rigid; resin-ducts external, or external and medial. Staminate catkins in short capitate
clusters. Conelets mucronate. Cones from 4 to 9 cm. long, ovate, symmetrical or oblique, tenaciously
persistent, dehiscent at maturity; apophyses lustrous, pale tawny yellow at first, gradually
changing to a dark nut-brown, tumid, the posterior scales often larger and more prominent.

  A tree of cold-temperate and subalpine levels, growing on the
  mountains of central and western China, and at lower altitudes in the
  north and in Corea. It is recognized by its tenaciously persistent
  cones with a remarkable change in color. It is constantly confused
  with P. Thunbergii and P. densiflora, neither of which grows
  spontaneously in China. From the former it differs in leaf-section and
  bud (the bud of P. sinensis is never white), from the latter in the
  lustre and the color variation of its cone, and from both in the
  frequent obliquity of its cone and in the frequent presence of
  trimerous leaf-fascicles.

  Of the two varieties of this species, densata and yunnanensis (Shaw in
  Sargent, Pl. Wilson. ii. 17), the former represents the extreme
  oblique form of cone, the latter represents the longest dimensions of
  cone and leaf. The effect of environment on this species can be seen
  in figs. 202, 203, from a lower slope and rich soil, and fig. 204,
  from a high rocky ledge in the same locality.

    1868 P. kasya Royle ex Parlatore in DC. Prodr. xvi-2, 390.

Spring-shoots uninodal, glabrous. Leaves from 12 to 24 cm. long, in fascicles of 3, rarely
of 2, very slender; resin-ducts external, rarely with a medial duct. Conelets mucronate. Cones
from 5 to 10 cm. long, ovate-conic, symmetrical or oblique, tenaciously persistent; apophyses
lustrous, nut-brown, convex or elevated along a transverse keel, the posterior scales of some
cones larger and more prominent than the anterior scales, the mucro usually deciduous.

  A species of the Philippines and of northern Burmah. In both countries
  it is locally exploited for wood and resin. It differs from the common
  form of P. sinensis by its much longer leaves, and from its var.
  yunnanensis, which it more resembles, by its much more slender and
  pliant leaves. Moreover its cone, so far as I can learn, is not yellow
  at maturity, but brown.

=XI. AUSTRALES=

Pits of the ray-cells small. Leaf-hypoderm biform or variable. Spring-shoots uninodal in some,
multinodal in other species. Cones dehiscent at maturity.

  This group combines the dehiscent cone of the Lariciones with the
  wood-anatomy of the serotinous Pines. Also the multinodal spring-shoot
  first appears here and is gradually developed among the species,
  absent in Nos. 37-39, sometimes present in Nos. 40-43, and prevalent
  in Nos. 44-47.

  All the species are of the Western Hemisphere, and among them may be
  found the biform hypoderm of the leaf, the internal resin-duct, and
  the total absence of external resin-ducts, characters common in
  American Hard Pines. The eastern species are quite constant in their
  characters and present no varietal forms; the western species, on the
  other hand, are very variable. This difference may be due to the even
  level and slight climatic differences of the Atlantic states and to
  the remarkable diversity of altitude and climate of the western states
  and Mexico.

    1846 P. orizabae Gordon in Jour. Hort. Soc. Lond. i. 237, f.

Spring-shoots uninodal, conspicuously pruinose. Bark-formation late, the cortex of young trees
smooth. Leaves in fascicles of 5, sometimes of 6, from 15 to 30 cm. long, drooping; resin-ducts
medial, hypoderm variable in amount, often in very large masses, the outer walls of the endoderm
thick. Conelets mucronate. Cones from 7 to 14 cm. long, ovate or ovate-conic, symmetrical or
oblique, deciduous and often leaving a few basal scales on the trees; apophyses rufous or fulvous
brown, flat, elevated or, in one variety, prolonged in various degrees, the prolongations nearly
uniform or much more prominent on the posterior face of the cone, the mucro usually deciduous.

  A species of the subtropical and warm-temperate altitudes of Mexico
  and Central America. Its range includes both eastern and western
  slopes of the northern plateau. Its northern limit is in Nuevo Leon,
  and it probably reaches in Nicaragua the southern limit of pines in
  the Western Hemisphere. It is distinguished from all its associates by
  the smooth gray trunk of the young trees, by their long internodes,
  and by their drooping gray-green foliage.

  Some cones of this species develop protuberances of all degrees of
  prominence up to the curious cone collected in Oaxaca by Nelson (var.
  apulcensis, Shaw, Pines Mex. t. 12, fig. 8). There is also a
  remarkable difference in the amount of leaf-hypoderm. On many trees of
  the western part of the range this tissue forms septa across the green
  mesophyll. Such partitions are sometimes met in other species, P.
  Pringlei or P. canariensis, where the hypoderm is abundant. But in P.
  pseudostrobus they appear in some leaves of weak, as well as of strong
  hypoderm (var. tenuifolia, Shaw, Pines Mex. t. 13, ff. 2, 4, 5, 7, 8).

Spring-shoots uninodal, slightly or not at all pruinose. Bark-formation early, the branches
becoming dark and rough. Leaves prevalently in fascicles of 5, but varying from 3 to 8, extremely
variable in length, attaining 45 cm. at subtropical levels; resin-ducts medial, hypoderm sometimes
uniform, more commonly multiform, the outer walls of the endoderm thick. Conelet mucronate,
the prickle often reflexed. Cones of many sizes, attaining in warm localities 30 cm. in length,
ovate-conic or long-conic, symmetrical, often curved, deciduous and often leaving a few scales
on the tree; apophyses dull, rarely lustrous, nut-brown, or of various shades of fuscous brown
to nearly black, flat, tumid, pyramidal or sometimes slightly protuberant, the prickle rarely
persistent.

  This species ranges from the mountains of northern Durango to the
  volcanoes of Guatemala, or possibly farther south. It is found at all
  altitudes where Pines can grow except on the tropical levels of
  Guatemala. Its more hardy forms have been successfully grown in the
  milder parts of Great Britain and northern Italy. It is felled for
  lumber in many parts of Mexico.

  This sturdy Pine and its numberless variations present the most
  remarkable example of adaptation in the genus. The variations are
  mostly those associated with changes of environment--dimensions of
  cone and leaf and the number of leaves in the fascicle. These are so
  accurately correlated with altitude and exposure, and are so
  imperceptibly graded, that no specific segregations among them have
  yet been successfully established.
