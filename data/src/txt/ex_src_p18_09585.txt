I think I'se 107 Y'ars ole. Wuz bawn in Williamson County 'fore de Civil wah. Guess de reason
I hab libed so long wuz cose I tuk good keer ob mahself en wore warm clo'es en still do, w'ar
mah yarn pettycoats now. Hab had good health all mah life. Hab tuk very lettle medicine en
de wust sickness I eber had wuz small-pox. I'se bin a widah 'bout 70 y'ars.

Mah mammy d'ed w'en I wuz young but mah daddy libed ter be 103 y'ars ole. I nebber went ter
schul a day in mah life, ma'ied 'fore freedum en w'en I got free, had ter wuk all de time ter
mek a libin' fer mah two chillen. One libes in California en I lives wid de uther, tergedder
wid mah great, great, grandson, five y'ars ole, in Nashville.

Mah fust marster en missis wuz Amos en Sophia Holland en he made a will dat we slaves wuz all
ter be kep' among de fam'ly en I wuz heired fum one fam'ly ter 'nother. Wuz owned under de
"will" by Haddas Holland, Missis Mary Haddock en den Missis Synthia Ma'ied Sam Pointer en I
libed wid her 'til freedum wuz 'clared.

Mah fust mistress had three looms en we had ter mek clothes fer ev'ery one on de plan'ashun.
I wuz taught ter weav', card, spin en 'nit en ter wuk in de fiel's. I wuz 'feared ob de terbacker
wums at fust but Aunt Frankie went 'long by me en showed me how ter pull de wum's head off.
Hab housed terbacker till 9 o'clock at nite. Our marster whupped us w'en we needed hit. I got
menny a whuppin'.

Marster Amos wuz a great hunter en had lots ob dogs en me en mah cousin had de job ob cookin'
dog food en feedin' de dogs. One day de marster went huntin' en lef three dogs in de pen fer
us ter feed. One ob de dogs licked out ob de pan en we got a bunch ob switches en started wearin'
de dogs out. We thought de marster wuz miles 'way w'en he walked up on us. He finished wearin'
de bunch ob switches out on us. Dat wuz a whuppin' I'll nebber fergit.

W'en I wuz heired ter Missis Synthis, I wuked in de fiel's 'til she started ter raise chillens
en den I wuz kep in de house ter see atter dem. Missis had a lot ob cradles en dey kep two
'omen in dat room takin' keer ob de babies en lettle chillens 'longin' ter dere slaves. Soon
as de chillens, wuz seven y'ars ole, dey started dem ter 'nittin'.

Marster Sam Pointer, husband of Missis Synthis, wus a good man en he wuz good ter us en he
fed en clothed us good. We wore yarn hoods, sha'ls, en pantletts which wuz 'nit things dat
kum fum yo shoe tops ter 'bove yo knees.

De marster wuz also a 'ligious man en he let us go ter chuch. He willed land fer a culled chuch
at Thompson Station. I 'longs ter de foot washin' Baptist, called de Free Will Baptist. De
marster bought mah husband William Gray en I ma'ied 'im dere.

W'en de Civil wah wuz startin' dere wuz soldiers an tents eve'ywhar. I had ter 'nit socks en
he'ps mek soldiers coats en durin' de wah, de marster sent 100 ob us down in Georgia ter keep
de Yankees fum gittin' us en we camped out durin' de whole three y'ars.

I member de Klu Klux. One nite a bunch ob us went out, dey got atter us. We waded a big crik
en hid in de bushes ter keep dem fum gittin' us.

Hab gon' ter lots ob camp-meetin's. Dey'd hab lots ob good things ter eat en fed eberbody.
Dey'd hab big baptizin's down at de Cumberland Riber and menny things.

W'en freed, our white folks didn't gib us nuthin'. We got 'way en hired out fer an'thin' we
could git. Nebber knowed ob any plantashuns [TR: illegible, possibly "men"] be divided. D'ant
member 'bout slave 'risings en niggers voting en wuz not ole er'nuff ter member de sta'rs fallin'.
Songs we use'ter sing wuz, "On Jordan's Bank I Stand en Cast a Wistful Eye en Lak Drops ob
Sweat, Lak Blood Run Down, I Shed mah Tears."

I try not ter think 'bout de ole times. Hit's bin so long ago so I don' member any tales now.

I'se had a lot ob good times in mah day. Our white folks would let us hab "bran dances" an
we'd hab a big time. I has nebber voted en I think dat ez a man's wuk. Don't b'leeve in signs,
I hab allus tho't whut ez gwine ter be will be, en de only way ter be ez de rite way.

Eber since slavery I'se cooked fer peeple. I cooked fer Mr. Lea Dillon fifteen y'ars. Wuked
at de Union Depot fer y'ars. Five y'ars fer Dr. Douglas at his Infirmary en I cooked fer en
raised Mrs Grady's baby. Hab wuked fer diff'ent folks ovuh town ter mek mah livin'. I ain't
bin able ter wuk fer eight y'ars. Dunno how much I weigh now, I hab lost so much. (she weighs
now at least 250 pounds). All de ex-slaves I know hab wuked at diff'ent jobs lak I has.

dem damn Yankees." Mah white folks had a pretty yard en gyarden. Soldiers kum en camped dere.
I'd slip ter de winder en lissen ter dem." "W'en dey wuz fightin' at Fort Negley de cannons
would jar our house. De soldier's ban' play on Capitol Hill, en play "Rally 'roun' de Flag
Boys, Rally 'roun de Flag."

"De slaves would tek dere ole iron cookin' pots en turn dem upside down on de groun' neah dere
cabins ter keep dere white folks fum hearin' w'at dey wuz sayin'. "Dey claimed dat hit showed
dat Gawd wuz wid dem."

"In slavery time peeples b'leeved in dreams. I members one nite I dreamed dat a big white thing

cer'mony in de days ob slavery wuz by de man en 'oman jumpin' ovuh a broom handle tergedder."

coal 'yer en eve'ythin' wuz wood en mos' ob dis town wuz in de woods."

"De slaves wuz tole dey would git forty ak'rs ob groun' en a mule w'en dey wuz freed but dey
nebber got hit. W'en we wuz free we wuz tuned out widout a thing. Mah grandmammy wuz an "Ole
mammie" en de Missis kep her. Atter freedum a lot ob Yankee niggah gals kum down 'yer en hire out."

"W'en I wuz a young girl hund'eds ob people went ter de wharf at de foot ob Broadway on de
fust Sunday in May ob eber'y year fer de annual baptizin' ob new members inter de Baptist (culored)
churches ob de city. Thousands ob white people would crowd both sides ob de Cumberland Riber,
Broadway en de Sparkman Street Bridge ter witnus de doin's. On leavin' de chuches de pastor
would lead de parade ter de wharf. Dey would sing en chant all de way fum de chuch ter de river
en sum ob de members would be ovuhkum wid 'ligious feelin' en dey would hop up en down, singin'
en shoutin' all de time, or may be dey would start ter runnin' down de street en de brethern
would hab ter run dem down en bring dem back."

"We useter hav' dem champ meetin's en dey wuz "honeys," en I enjoy dem too. We wore bandanna
handkerchiefs on our haids en long shawls ovuh our shoulders. At deze meetin's dey had all
kinds ob good things ter eat en drink."

no matter w'at happens en dat's may be cause ob mah livin' so long."

"Things ter day ez mighty bad. Not lak de ole days. Worl' ez gwin ter end soon."

"Atter I got ter feeble ter do washin' en ironin' fer mah livin', I went ter de Relief Office
ter git dem ter he'ps me, but dey wouldn't do a thing. I had no place ter go er no money ter
do wid. Dis culid 'oman tuk me in en does all she can fer me but now she ez disable ter wuk

I ez too. Mah daddy slipped 'way fum 'im en went home."

"W'en I wuz a young boy, I didn't wear nothin' but a shirt lak all urthur boys en hit wuz a
long thing lak a slip dat kum ter our knees. Our Mistress had a big fier place en w'en we would
kum in cole she would say ain't you all cole. (You all was always used in the plural and not
singular as some writers have it). W'ile we wuz warmin' she often played de organ fer us ter heer."

ob de Marster, wuz in bad health at dat time, en 'fore we sta'ted ter de graveyard, I put a
feather bed in de car'age en got a pitcher ob water ready en 'fore we git dere she got awful sick."

"Durin' slavery de slaves hadder keep quiet en dey would turn a kittle upside down ter keep
de white folks 'yearin dere prayers en chants. W'en a slave wanted ter go ter 'nother plantation
he had ter hab a pass. Ef' dey disobeyed dey got a whuppin, en ef dey had a pass widout de
Marsters signature dey got a whuppin. Ef'n dey had ter hab passes now dere wouldin' be no meaness."

see a ball ob fier rollin' on de fence en w'en dey would git ter de spring, a big white thing
lak a dog would crawl under de rock. De slaves wuz natur'ally superstitious en b'leeved in
dreams, ole sayings en signs. I hab mahse'f se'ed things dat I ain't onderstan'. Hab almost
seen de things dat (apostle) John seed."

"Dunno nuthin 'bout any ob de ex-slaves voting er de Nat Turner 'Bellion."

"Atter freedum mos' ob de slaves wuk'd fer dere livin' jes as I ez. De men in de fiel's, de

One man jumped up grabbed a cheer sayin' ah'll knock you down wid dis cheer."

"De slave 'pected ter git 40 akers ob land en a mule but nobody eber got hit as fur as I know.
We didn't git nuthin. Our white peeple wuzzent able ter gib us anyting. Eve'ythin' dey had
wuz tuk durin' de wah. Dey wuz good ter us an stuck wid us en mah peeple stayed wid mah Mistress."
