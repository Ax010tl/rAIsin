You are all, doubtless, more or less familiar with the American Missionary, and read from time
to time Mr. Pond's reports found therein. I will give a few statistics quoted from my husband's
report, read recently before the General Association of California, convened in Santa Cruz.
They are as follows:

Nineteen schools, as against 15 the last year; total enrollment of scholars, 2,823, as against
2,567 the former year; 40 teachers, of whom 14 were Chinese, as against 31 teachers the previous
year, of whom 11 were Chinese; number of those who have professed to cease from idolatry, 175,
as against 156 the year before; number of those who have given evidence of conversion, 121,
as against 106 the former year, and the whole number of those who have turned to Christ during
the history of the Mission, 400, who are scattered over the United States and in China. We
hear of many of them who are doing good work for the Master and for the salvation of their
countrymen.

Toward the expense of the Mission during the past year the Chinese themselves have contributed
$730.05.

I would like to have you remember the name of our church. It is "Bethany." Remember us in your
prayers, for God has laid a great work upon us. We started in much weakness, but God has been
with us and blessed us. We have felt His presence in our Bethany as Martha and Mary of old
did in theirs. We have heard the Master's voice saying unto us frequently, "Inasmuch as ye
have done it unto one of the least of these, My brethren, ye have done it unto Me."

MOUNTAIN WHITE WORK IN KENTUCKY.

BY MRS. A. A. MYERS.

There is an unnoticed class of people dwelling almost in the very centre of the settled portion
of the United States. "Our brother in black" has been held up to the view of two continents
for the last fifty years. And what is America going to do with him and for him, has been a
question which has interested the whole civilized world. This same question for a still longer
time has been propounded in regard to the red man of the forest, and in later years concerning
the Chinese. And right nobly has the Christian brotherhood evidenced its purpose to make men
of these degraded classes. But until recently it has escaped the notice of these Christian
workers that we have another class as needy perhaps as any. No spice of romance is connected
with them. No barbarous tale of cruelty could be told to awaken sympathy in them. They are
simply poor people, who during slavery were unable to obtain large plantations and so were
driven by the arrogant Bluegrass slaveholder on the one side, and the greedy cotton-planter
on the other, back into the mountains, where they are shut away from the rest of the world
by mountain barriers, and still more hopelessly by the haughty caste spirit of the slave-holding
monarchs, who disdain to have anything to do with them except to seek their votes.

These people are not really poor. Most of them own farms of three or four hundred acres; and
the soil, if properly tilled, would be quite productive. Their plowing is done in the most
primitive manner. A single horse attached to a little shovel plow simply tears the sod a little,
enough so the weeds spring up luxuriantly, and the women and children must work hard in the
hot sun to destroy them, while the lord of the home saddles his horse and rides to town, to
sit on store boxes and tell low stories. This people, especially the male portion, seem to
have a natural distaste for labor. They would be aristocratic if they could. In days of slavery
they had their household servants, and tried to imitate the more wealthy slave-owners by living
in idleness, and they still look upon labor as degrading.

They make no effort to get themselves homes. The large majority live in log cabins, with no
windows. The doors stand open winter and summer. The women in cool weather always sit with
a little shawl around them and a sunbonnet on.

There are generally two rooms to each house, usually with a chimney or open hall between them,
so you have to go out of doors to pass from one to the other. In the kitchen (which also serves
as dining-room) is a large fireplace and a cook stove, if they are the happy possessors of one.

The other is the sitting and sleeping-room. You will often see three beds and one or two trundle-beds
in a single room. Here the whole family and all the visitors sleep. We have sought to rest
with thirteen of us in a room, perhaps 15 by 20 feet, and not a window in it and the doors
shut. Fortunately the large-mouthed fireplace gave a pittance of ventilation. No carpets are
used, and furniture is very limited. I believe nine-tenths of the people could put all their
goods on a couple of loads and be ready to move at an hour's notice.

Families are large, numbering twelve, fifteen or even nineteen children. Girls marry young,
and seem to be entirely satisfied with their condition. You seldom hear a desire expressed
for anything they don't possess. Give them a box of snuff and a stick to chew it with and you
never hear a murmur escape their lips. Tobacco is indispensable. Old and young, male and female,
are wedded to it. I have known of an old gentleman working all day for fifty cents and spending
forty cents at night for tobacco for himself and wife and nine children.

They seem to be without a standard in the land. They live so isolated, and have measured themselves
by themselves until they have lost all idea of accurate judgment. Morality and sobriety are
hardly looked for, even among church members and ministers. "Religion may be up to fever heat,
while morality is down to zero." People "confess," as they call it, and join the church, and
in their entire life thereafter you could never know any difference.

They are satisfied if their names are on the church book. I don't think they ever question
their eternal salvation after they are once inside a church. If a person dies without having
joined a church his friends frame some theory on which they rest their hope of his salvation.
A young man was shot a little while ago in a drunken broil. As he fell mortally wounded he
cried, "Oh, Lord!" His mother is sure he is safe because he called on the Lord. They have no
conception of living religion. They have no prayer or conference meetings. Aside from our own
I doubt if there is a prayer meeting nearer than Berea, seventy miles away. There is no family
prayer in all the land. I asked my class of boys, twenty or more in number, how many had ever
heard their mothers' voice in prayer. Not one of them could raise a hand. At another school
I asked a still larger class the same question, and only one girl raised her hand. There is
no gathering of the little home nestlings together and instructing them--no Bible instruction
given in the family. It has ceased to be a wonder to me, to ask nearly grown boys some of the
most simple Bible questions, and hear them answer, "I don't know."

An M. E. minister in one of his pastoral visits took occasion to dwell with some stress on
the blessedness of walking in the light. The mother showed how she literalized by promptly
remarking, "Yes; I've told John I wanted a hole sawed in this end of the house, but he won't
do it." During the same call he asked a young lady if she was preparing to go to judgment.
She replied, "No, I reckin I won't go. If I do I'll have to walk, for we hain't got but two
nags, and Rachel and Becky always ride them."

The prevailing churches are the Reform or Campbellites, the Methodists, and the Missionary
and Anti-Missionary Baptists. The latter church is strong all through the mountains. They are
bigoted and ignorant, and boast that their knowledge comes direct from the throne, and they
have nothing to do with man-made theories, as they call education. Their preaching is a sort
of canting reiteration of the text and what few Scripture verses they chance to know and some
hackneyed expressions. They are great on arguing, and it would be laughable if it was not so
pitiful to hear the profound questions they discuss. Last season one of these preachers nearly
broke up one of our mission Sunday-Schools, which we could attend only each alternate Sabbath.
In the passage that reads "And anon they tell Him," he contended that A-non was an angel, and
they referred to the angel A-non. Each Sunday when we were not there that important question
had to be discussed.

One of these same preachers took his children from school because they were taught the heresy
in geography that the world is round. They do all they can to prejudice the people against
our work. They call our religion railroad religion. They are great barriers in our way. Still
we have been cheered this year to see that their hold on the young people is loosening, and
we are getting their hearts in spite of the protests of their parents. One of our mission Sunday-Schools,
which has averaged this season one hundred, is composed almost entirely of young people and
children, seldom ever a parent there.

The Smith American Organ Co. have honored God and themselves, and will ever be held by some
hearts in grateful remembrance by their gift to that society of a new organ. I have some times
thought, as I have heard the young voices ring out with such enthusiasm, that, though critics
might smile at our endeavor, Heaven would not disdain our offering of praise. The dingy low
walls, the glass-less windows, the tobacco besmeared floor, become transformed to a holy temple,
where God deigned to make visible His presence, and it has been a sacred place. Our hope of
this people centres largely in the young. If it were not for them, we could not feel it right
to stay among them.

Another barrier to be overcome is their habits of worship. They have meetings but once a month
during the summer and none at all during the winter. When they have service it is more for
a visit than worship. Their churches are rough log houses, and so small that the greater part
of the congregation remain out of doors. Four or more ministers are always in attendance, and
all must preach. The congregation expect a tiresome time, and from the first are restless.
They go out and come in, and they keep a constant march to and from the water pail, which usually
sits on the desk in front of the speaker. Several grown people at a time will be standing waiting
on each other at the pail. The speaker seems to be used to such things, and not at all disconcerted.
Nearly all their services are funeral services for those who may have been dead for years.
They bury their dead the same day or the day following death. They have no religious service,
except a prayer at the grave, if there chance to be a minister present. Generally about a year
after death, but often from five to fifteen years after, they have the funeral sermon preached.

In regard to healthfulness of our mountain home, we have felt somewhat disappointed. Up so
high, with nice springs and spring streams, one would expect a healthy climate. On the contrary,
almost every one is ailing. Coughs and colds are universal. It is no wonder the natives are
unhealthy; their habits of living would seem to prohibit health. They eat corn bread or hoe
cake and bacon; some have flour, but it is always made up into hot biscuit, shortened with
lard. They have this, with little variation, three times a day, 365 days in a year. In summer,
green beans cooked with bacon is added to the bill of fare. Of course the blood becomes impoverished,
and almost every one has scrofula. Calomel and pills are the great panacea for all their bodily
ills. Pills are brought on by the quart, and sold by the merchants like any other commodity.
Cleanliness of the person is an unheard of luxury; I doubt whether they ever bathe. Children
come to the table with unwashed faces. They are put to bed with the same clothes they wear
during the day. Then add to all this the fact that tobacco is used almost from the cradle,
and whiskies and toddies from the time the poor child opens its eyes to this world, and it's
no great marvel that gray-haired men are exceedingly rare, and it's the "old man" and the "old
woman" when one has reached the age of twenty-five.

Now comes the question, What are we doing for the people? We have been with them nearly two
years, and this has been our effort from the first, to get them to see that religion is a life
rather than a sectarian belief. We have sought to impress upon them that joining a church is
not Christianity. We have succeeded in getting a few to take part in our prayer meetings, and
we have the assurance that all the people are awaking to the fact that God has some demands
upon them. We have from the first kept up regular Thursday night prayer meetings; have had
good attendance, but often only Mr. Myers and myself to take part in them except as others
read Scripture verses.

On the Sabbath we have Sunday-school at 9:30. Average attendance, 100; preaching at 11. I hasten
home, saddle my horse, and ride six miles to the next railroad station (Pleasant View). Here
I have met 100 or more young people. I have been surprised that in a land where a woman isn't
expected to know anything, or be anything but a doll or a drudge that there has been so little
prejudice against my school. Some, of course, have thought a woman entirely out of her sphere
to undertake such work and have taken occasion to remark to my friends: "Why, Mrs. Myers opens
the school by prayer, just as Mr. Myers would. I don't know but it's all right, but it don't
seem just the proper thing for a woman to do."

Mr. M. has a mission in South Williamsburg or the mills, where numbers of children are growing
up in the midst of gambling and shooting. Prof. W. has, about the same hour, a school two miles
out in another direction. At night we have services again in Williamsburg. At these services
we have more than can get into the house, and many are obliged to leave for lack of accommodation.
Tuesday nights we go to Pleasant View and help them learn the Gospel Songs. Each alternate
Wednesday evening, church socials; each alternate Friday afternoon, Band of Hope; Saturday
evening, choir drill; Covenant Meeting once a month on Saturday afternoon.

Mr. Myers has preached during the year beginning with Oct. '82, one hundred and forty-two sermons.
The services, together with the other public services just mentioned, have amounted to three
hundred and forty. Have attended fifty or more meetings conducted by others. We spend all the
remaining time our strength will permit in calling at the homes.

We have a neat modern church nearly finished, and so far without foreign help. But no one knows
what an effort has been required. Mr. Myers would announce a working bee to draw stone or any
such work; would try to enthuse the people as he has so often done in the North. But when the
time would come he has worked all day alone. We have learned at last that this people don't
enthuse.

We are hard at work in our high-school enterprise. We have Prof. and Mrs. W. and Miss G., all
from the North, with us. We hope to get a school, the good influence of which will never die
out of these mountains.

These are peculiar people. What I have said of them has reference to the general class of society.
But there are some who seem of better stock, who are shrewd, keen, far-sighted people. You
cannot find their superiors in native ability in any country. Though often lacking in culture
and morality, they still hold a wide influence over the rest, so that something besides goodness
is required in those who wish to come among them as helpers. There must be ability to adapt
oneself to these widely diverse conditions. One needs wisdom and tact to get along with the
shrewdest, and such a love for souls that he can come with a helping hand to the most degraded,
nor be discouraged if, with a heart brimful of sympathy, he reaches the hand a long time only
to see it rejected by those most in need.

The work is a work of time. The majority of the people are unstable, thriftless improvident
and ignorant. Slavery left its blight of impotency and profligacy upon them. They come and
go as did their fathers a hundred years ago. Their tools and utensils are the same their great-grandparents
used, and they are content with them. We never worked harder and saw less result in the conversion
of sinners than while in Kentucky, and yet never felt more satisfied that we were where God
wants us, and doing an important work. Unless these people have help they will prove a fretting
leprosy in our nation.

WORK AMONG THE COLORED PEOPLE OF THE SOUTH.

BY MISS IDA M. BEACH.

No small part of the work undertaken by the A. M. A. is that among the colored people of the
South. Perhaps we may judge something of how vast this work is in itself, and how far-reaching
in its results, if we consider for a few moments the numbers and condition of the colored people.
Twenty years ago about 4,000,000 people were liberated from bondage, with all the evils resulting
from the system of slavery resting upon them. There was great rejoicing among lovers of freedom
when the Proclamation of Emancipation was issued. The slaves themselves, wild with joy, shouted,
"We're free! We're free! The year of jubilee has come!" Free! yes, free! but with the burdens
of manhood and womanhood suddenly thrust upon them. Freedom brought the right and opportunity
of establishing homes. Glorious privilege! But do we not all know how much good judgment and
wisdom and thought and planning it takes to maintain a true home? Freedom gave them the right
of keeping their little ones and seeing them grow to manhood and womanhood, but oh! how much
of patience and God-given power it requires to train the little feet to tread the right way!

Four million people, half civilized, uneducated, untrained, with the judgment and reason of
children, hitherto knowing little of the ways of the outer world, suddenly brought into life's
conflicts! What an amount of instruction they needed!

Right here the American Missionary Association stepped in and assumed the work of training
these people. Christian men and women, filled with love for the Master, went down among these
lowly ones. They carried the Gospel of Jesus Christ, established schools and churches, teaching
in the open air, or in rude huts and deserted cabins. For twenty years this work has been carried
on, and much good has been done in the name of the Lord. But to-day there are between six and
seven million colored people in our Southland. The work of the A. M. A., together with all
done by other societies and by students going forth from the colleges as teachers, as yet scarcely
begins to reach this great number.

Their first need is to be Christianized, for this alone lifts them up and gives a desire for
better things. It is the religion of Jesus Christ alone which has given to us our high estate.
How much we owe to the training of Christian mothers! Let us pity and stoop to lift up these
ignorant ones. Send out those who can carry the glad tidings and point to the Lamb of God,
who taketh away the sin of the world.

Let us do all we can to teach them what the pure religion is. But we cannot stop here. We must
teach them how to use it. "Woman's work for woman," surely, for this must be done in the homes.

Freedom gave them the right to establish homes! They did the best they knew how, many of them,
but they needed teaching--they need it to-day. They must be taught thrift and industry, and
cleanliness and order. They want someone to come to them and help them to transform their huts
into homes. Could you see their rags, their ugly, misshapen garments, you would agree with
me that the women and girls greatly need to be taught the use of the needle.

Of course Christian schools need to be multiplied among them, where the rudiments of an English
education shall be thoroughly given, where sewing and cooking, the care of the house and the
care of the sick shall be carefully taught the girls, where the boys may learn the use of tools
and all that pertains to good farming.

Our stronghold is the children. We can never eradicate the evils existing among the older generation.
Slavery left too much ignorance and superstition to ever be driven from the minds of those
who lived under its sway. But we are responsible for the coming generations.

The American Missionary Association aims to reach the young and meet their needs by the workers
sent out.

Perhaps our work in Savannah will be illustrative of that done in many other parts of the field.
We have there established a church and school. There are now in school over 200 pupils. The
majority of these remain long enough with us to obtain a good common-school education. We have
also a normal grade, where methods of teaching are taught those who desire to fit themselves
for teachers. Besides this we have fitted up a sewing-room, where the girls learn every part
of sewing and repairing, cutting and basting. Many schools have shops for boys; we look forward
to the time when we may be able to have them, too.

We are just establishing a reading-room. Those who have read Prof. Salisbury's article in the
November MISSIONARY understand how much this is needed. In our present circumstances we arrange
it so that all pupils of higher grades have a daily reading hour, with teacher to direct. Then
once in two weeks the older pupils meet for a social reading.

In our devotional exercises and school prayer meetings we aim to assist them in a knowledge
of true religion. Last year we observed the Week of Prayer, and in the daily meetings held
for several weeks some found the way to Christ and Christian life. Our Church and Sunday-School
work reaches many who are not connected with our school. We have a devoted missionary who spends
her time in visiting the parents and children in their homes, ministering to the wants of the
sick and needy, and holding Bible and Missionary meetings.

This is a bare outline of our work. I presume many of you are saying. "Have there been no results
during these last twenty years?" Oh yes, we have a bright side to the picture. When we are
tired and discouraged, and wonder if harvest time will never come, we go to some of the pleasant
homes where great changes have been wrought. We point to a scholar and tell her past history,
and then thank God that the seed sown found a lodging place and good soil.

In the cities when the large schools are, and where there are fair public schools--where there
is constant contact with civilized life, many of the colored people live well. Yet there may
be a neat, cosy home just across the street, and a few doors beyond, a wretched hovel.

In the country, when the "Teachers' Home" and little school house are built beside their log
cabins, they catch a glimpse of better things than they have known. The modest house, freshly
painted, with the neat, cosy rooms inside--very simple and plain to us--seems like a palace
to them. They begin to want the same. The children go to school and come home with wonderful
things to tell. Faces and hands become clean, the woolly heads are more carefully combed, rents
are mended, the girls put on clean collars.

The missionary shows the women how to fashion home-made lounges and stools, they are covered
with some bright calico, the floor is scrubbed white, and they begin to live. The teacher says
that they must work if they want to have homes, money begins to be saved, and before you know
it little frame houses are going up beside the old cabin. A good horse or mule, with a bright
shiny buggy, takes the place of the old steer and cart.

Yes, indeed, much has been accomplished. But we had very few workers in the early days among
four million people, although just as many as could be supported with the means furnished,
and to-day, among nearly seven millions, we have but 336 workers.

Millions sit in darkness right here in our own land. A mighty work is to be done, and the work
in Africa must be done largely by these people, too.

We need more money; Christian men and women to go forth, and Christian men and women who are
willing to send them. "He that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal."

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The information from the field, to which you have listened, explains to you the necessity for
the organization of a Bureau of Woman's Work. It was organized in April, 1883, for the purpose,
as was then stated:

1. To give information to the ladies in the churches of the variety of work sustained by the
Association and to assist in devising plans of help.

2. To promote correspondence with churches, Sabbath-schools, missionary societies or individuals
who will undertake work of a special character, such as the support of missionaries, aiding
of students, supplying clothing, furnishing goods, and meeting other wants on mission ground.

3. To send to the churches, conferences or associations desiring it, experienced and intelligent
lady missionaries to address them, giving fuller details of our methods of work.

It was believed that the growing interest on the part of the ladies of our churches, and their
evident disposition to aid more effectively in the elevation of women, particularly the women
of the South, called for such a department. Already the ladies of one State had organized the
"Woman's Aid to the A. M. A.," that they might have their definite line of work in the support
of lady missionaries, and inquiry had been made by many how best to assist in this work.

It was recognized that in no other way could a general interest be awakened and maintained
so well as by giving direct information from the field, and the twenty years' experience of
the Association in the South, during which time more than 3,000 different ladies had been employed
as missionaries and teachers, the knowledge gained of the peculiarities of the field and best
methods of reaching the people, and the thorough organization of the different departments
of labor in home, school, and church, prepared us to bring before the ladies the information
necessary, and to offer most excellent opportunities for special work for women. The ready
response to this movement confirms the wisdom of the step, and we trust that ere long the Bureau
will open new avenues of usefulness to the ladies of the churches, and give enlargement and
efficiency to the work in the field.
