Similar comparisons of Shakespeare and Addison occur in William Guthrie’s Essay upon English
Tragedy (1747) and Edward Young’s Conjectures on Original Composition (1759). The former may
have been inspired by Johnson’s conversation. Cf. also Warburton’s comparison incorporated
in Theobald’s preface of 1733.

clipped hedge is to a forest.”

136. Go before, I’ll follow. This remark was made by Zachary Grey in his Notes on Shakespeare,
vol. ii., p. 53. He says that “Go you before and I will follow you,” Richard III., i. 1. 144,

thus: “Of Rowe, as of all the editors, I have preserved the preface, and have likewise retained
the authour’s life, though not written with much elegance or spirit.” This criticism is passed
on Rowe’s Account as emended by Pope, but is more applicable to it in its original form.

the dull duty of an editor. P. 61. Cf. the condensed criticism of Pope’s edition in the Life

146. Johnson’s appreciation of Hanmer was shared by Zachary Grey. “Sir Thomas Hanmer,” says
Grey, “has certainly done more towards the emendation of the text than any one, and as a fine
gentleman, good scholar, and (what was best of all) a good Christian, who has treated every
editor with decency, I think his memory should have been exempt from ill treatment of every
kind, after his death.” Johnson’s earliest criticism of Hanmer’s edition was unfavourable.

147. Warburton was incensed by this passage and the many criticisms throughout the edition,
but Johnson’s prediction that “he’ll not come out, he’ll only growl in his den” proved correct.
He was content to show his annoyance in private letters. See note, p. 101.

The Revisal of Shakespear’s text was published anonymously by Benjamin Heath (1704-1766) in
1765. According to the preface it had been written about 1759 and was intended as “a kind of
supplement to the Canons of Criticism.” The announcement of Johnson’s edition induced Heath
to publish it: “Notwithstanding the very high opinion the author had ever, and very deservedly,
entertained of the understanding, genius, and very extensive knowledge of this distinguished
writer, he thought he saw sufficient reason to collect, from the specimen already given on
Macbeth, that their critical sentiments on the text of Shakespear would very frequently, and
very widely, differ.” In the first three editions of the Preface the title is given incorrectly
as The Review, etc. See note, p. 171.

At least Garrick took offence at it. On 22nd January, 1766, Joseph Warton writes to his brother
that “Garrick is intirely off from Johnson, and cannot, he says, forgive him his insinuating
that he withheld his old editions, which always were open to him” (Wooll’s Biographical Memoirs
of Joseph Warton, 1806, p. 313). Cf. the London Magazine, October, 1765, p. 538.

without deviating from modesty or truth.”

Richard Farmer.

Joseph Cradock (1742-1826) had been a student at Emmanuel College, Cambridge. He left the University
without a degree, but in 1765 was granted the honorary degree of M.A. by the Chancellor, the
Duke of Newcastle. His Literary and Miscellaneous Memoirs appeared in 1828.

the Water-poet, John Taylor (1580-1653); cf. Farmer’s note, p. 212.

The quotation is from Taylor’s Motto (Spenser Society Reprint of Folio of 1630, p. 217):—

    I was well entred (forty Winters since)
    As far as possum in my Accidence;
    And reading but from possum to posset,
    There I was mir’d, and could no further get.

In his Thiefe he says “all my schollership is schullership” (id., p. 282).

164. held horses at the door of the playhouse. This anecdote was given in Theophilus Cibber’s
Lives of the Poets, 1753, i., p. 130. Johnson appended it, in his edition, to Rowe’s Account
of Shakespeare (ed. 1765, p. clii), and it was printed in the same year in the Gentleman’s
Magazine (xxxv., p. 475). The story was told to Pope by Rowe, who got it from Betterton, who
in turn had heard it from Davenant; but Rowe wisely doubted its authenticity and did not insert
it in his Account (see the Variorum edition of 1803, i., pp. 120-122).—Farmer makes fun of
it here,—and uses it to vary the Critical reviewer’s description—“as naked with respect to
all literary merit as he was when he first went under the ferula” (Crit. Rev. xxiii., p. 50).

Dodsley, Robert (1703-1764), publisher and author, declared himself “Untutored by the love

166. Small Latin and less Greek. “This passage of Ben. Jonson, so often quoted, is given us
in the admirable preface to the late edition, with a various reading, ‘Small Latin and no Greek’;
which hath been held up to the publick as a modern sophistication: yet whether an error or
not, it was adopted above a century ago by W. Towers, in a panegyrick on Cartwright. His eulogy,

him.” The concluding phrase of Farmer’s quotation is taken from an earlier portion of Fuller’s
description: “William Shakespeare ... in whom three eminent Poets may seem in some sort to
be compounded, 1. Martial ... 2. Ovid ... 3. Plautus, who was an exact comedian, yet never
any scholar, as our Shakespeare (if alive) would confess himself.”

Mr. Glldon. “Hence perhaps the ill-starr’d rage between this critick and his elder brother,
John Dennis, so pathetically lamented in the Dunciad. Whilst the former was persuaded that
‘the man who doubts of the learning of Shakespeare hath none of his own,’ the latter, above
regarding the attack in his private capacity, declares with great patriotick vehemence that
‘he who allows Shakespeare had learning, and a familiar acquaintance with the Ancients, ought
to be looked upon as a detractor from the glory of Great Britain.’ Dennis was expelled his
college for attempting to stab a man in the dark: Pope would have been glad of this anecdote”
(Farmer). Farmer supplied the details in a letter to Isaac Reed dated Jan. 28, 1794: see the

to the present time. A third volume brought the history of the theatre down to 1771. Farmer
refers to vol. ii., p. 107: “Double Falshood, a Tragedy, by Mr. Theobald, said by him to be
written by Shakespear, which no one credited; and on Enquiry, the following Contradiction appeared;
the Story of the Double Falshood is taken from the Spanish of Cervantes, who printed it in

replaced by a reference to the prologue written in 1671, which says that “’Twas Shirley’s muse
that labour’d for its birth.” But there appears to be no further evidence that the play was
by Shirley.
