Sunday, 7th December, Porter Hill. Mounted and started at six a.m. I find that I can endure
the motion of the horse better than I expected; but about mid-day began to feel it very much.
Towards four o'clock found some rain water about ten miles from Termination Hill, for which
I am very thankful, for I could not have continued the journey any further. Camped. Wind variable.

Monday, 8th December, Termination Hill. During the night had a heavy thunderstorm and shower
from the south-east. Started at six a.m. and arrived at Mr. Glen's Station at sundown, quite
done up; received a hearty welcome. Encountered a heavy storm of thunder and lightning a few
miles from the station. Wind, south-east.

Tuesday, 9th December, Mr. Glen's Station. Proceeded to Mount Stuart Station, where I had the
pleasure of meeting Mr. John Chambers, who received me with great kindness. There has been
some heavy rain here lately. Wind, south-east. Day hot.

Wednesday, 10th December, Mount Stuart Station. Accompanied by Mr. Chambers, proceeded to Moolooloo,
and arrived there in the afternoon completely tired and exhausted from riding in the saddle.
Day hot. Wind, east.

In conclusion, I beg to say, that I believe this country (i.e., from the Roper to the Adelaide
and thence to the shores of the Gulf), to be well adapted for the settlement of an European
population, the climate being in every respect suitable, and the surrounding country of excellent
quality and of great extent. Timber, stringy-bark, iron-bark, gum, etc., with bamboo fifty
to sixty feet high on the banks of the river, is abundant, and at convenient distances. The
country is intersected by numerous springs and watercourses in every direction. In my journey
across I was not fortunate in meeting with thunder showers or heavy rains; but, with the exception
of two nights, I was never without a sufficient supply of water. This will show the permanency
of the different waters, and I see no difficulty in taking over a herd of horses at any time;
and I may say that one of our party, Mr. Thring, is prepared to do so. My party have conducted
themselves throughout this long and trying journey to my entire satisfaction; and I may particularly
mention Messrs. Kekwick and Thring, who had been with me on my former expedition. During my
severe illness every attention and sympathy were shown to me by every one in the party, and
I herewith beg to record to them my sincere thanks.

I may here mention that the accident which occurred to me at the starting of the Expedition
from Adelaide has rendered my right hand almost useless for life.

The Journal concludes with the following letter:

To the Honourable H.B.T. Strangways, Commissioner of Crown Lands and Immigration.

Adelaide, December 18, 1862.

Sir,

For the information of His Excellency the Governor-in-Chief, I have the honour to report to
you my return to Adelaide, after an absence of twelve months and thirteen days; and I herewith
beg to hand you my chart and journals of the Expedition from which I have just returned.

To you, Sir, and the Government, my especial thanks are due for the liberal manner in which
the supplies were voted, and for the kind and ready assistance I at all times experienced.
Also to George Hamilton, Esquire, Chief Inspector of Police, for the efficient manner in which
my party was fitted out. The original promoters of my various expeditions, Messrs. James Chambers
and William Finke, have always shown the most lively interest in my success, to which they
cheerfully contributed. How much I regret the unexpected decease of the first-named gentleman
I need here hardly state, for he was indeed heart and soul in the result, and no one would
have felt so proud of my success as my much-lamented and best friend James Chambers. To Mr.
John Chambers I am also under many obligations for assistance in many instances, and I hereby
tender him my best thanks.

I have the honour, etc.,

J.M. STUART.

[FROM THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE ZOOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF LONDON. JUNE 9, 1863.]

ON A COLLECTION OF BIRDS FROM CENTRAL AUSTRALIA.

BY JOHN GOULD, F.R.S., ETC.

The Board of Governors of the South Australian Institute having liberally forwarded for my
inspection a selection from the ornithological collection made by Mr. Frederick G. Waterhouse
during Mr. Stuart's late Exploratory Expedition into Central Australia, I have thought the
matter of sufficient interest to bring these birds under the notice of the Society, the more
so as it will enable me to make known through our Proceedings a new and very beautiful species
of Parrakeet pertaining to the genus Polyteles, of which only two have been hitherto known.
Every ornithologist must be acquainted with the elegant P. melanurus and P. barrabandi, and
I feel assured that the acquisition of an additional species of this lovely form will be hailed
with pleasure. The specific appellation I would propose for this novelty is alexandrae, in
honour of that Princess who, we may reasonably hope, is destined at some future time to be
the Queen of these realms and their dependencies, of which Australia is by no means the most
inconspicuous.

Polyteles alexandrae, sp. nov.

Forehead delicate light blue; lower part of the cheeks, chin, and throat rose-pink; head, nape,
mantle, back, and scapularies olive-green; lower part of the back and rump blue, of a somewhat
deeper tint than that of the crown; shoulders and wing-coverts pale yellowish green; spurious
wing bluish green; external webs of the principal primaries dull blue, narrowly edged with
greenish yellow; the remaining primaries olive-green, edged with greenish yellow; under wing-coverts
verditer-green; breast and abdomen olive-grey, tinged with vinous; thighs rosy red; upper tail-coverts
olive, tinged with blue; two centre tail-feathers bluish olive-green; the two next on each
side olive-green on their outer webs and dark brown on the inner ones; the remaining tail-feathers
tricoloured, the central portion being black, the outer olive-grey, and the inner deep rosy
red; under tail-coverts olive; bill coral red; feet nearly brown.

Total length 14 inches; bill 1/2; wing 7; tail 9; tarsi 7/8.

Habitat. Howell Ponds, Central Australia, 16 degrees 54 minutes 7 seconds South latitude.

Remark. This is in every respect a typical Polyteles, having the delicate bill and elegantly
striped tail characteristic of that form. It is of the same size as P. barrabandi, but differs
from that species in having the crown blue and the lower part of the cheeks rose-pink instead
of yellow.

The following is a list of the other species of birds comprised in the collection:

Trichoglossus rubritorquis. Rare.

Aprosmictus erythropterus.

Platycercus brownii. Rare.

Struthidea cinerea.

Climacteris melanura.

Pomatorhinus rubecula. Rare.

Cincloramphus cruralis.

Artamus leucopygialis.

Artamus cinereus. Rare.

Colluricincla brunnea.

Petroica bicolor.

Pardalotus rubricatus. Extremely rare: the second specimen seen.

Graucalus melanops.

Tropidorhynchus argenteiceps.

Geopelia cuneata.

Geopelia humeralis.

Erythrogonys cinctus.

DESCRIPTIONS OF NEW SPECIES OF FRESHWATER SHELLS COLLECTED BY MR. F.G. WATERHOUSE, DURING J.
McDOUALL STUART'S OVERLAND JOURNEY FROM ADELAIDE TO THE NORTH-WEST COAST OF AUSTRALIA. BY ARTHUR
ADAMS, F.L.S., AND G. FRENCH ANGAS, CORRESPONDING MEMBER OF THE ZOOLOGICAL SOCIETY.

1. Vivipara waterhousii, Adams & Angas.

V. testa turbinata, globoso-conica, late umbilicata, spira elatiuscula, epidermide tenui fusco-viridi
obtecta; anfractibus convexis, ad suturas subplanatis, faciis tribus vel quatuor angustis olivaceo-viridibus
transversis ornatis; anfractu ultimo inflato, lineis duabus impressis ad peripheriam instructo;
apertura ovata, postice subangulata; labio simplici; labro acuto.

Long. 2 inches, lat. 1 inch 8 lines.

Habitat. Newcastle Waters, Arnhem's Land (Coll. Angas):

This fine species most nearly resembles Vivipara ussuriensis, Gerst.; but the last whorl is
more inflated, and the surface of the shell is not malleated or lirate. It is the largest species
yet discovered on the Australian continent. We have great pleasure in dedicating it to F.G.
Waterhouse, Esquire, who, under great difficulties during the expedition, succeeded in making
many valuable additions to science.

2. Vivipara kingi, Adams & Angas.

V. testa turbinata, globoso-conica, umbilicata, spira mediocri erosa nodulosa, epidermide tenui
pallide fusco-viridi obtecta, ad apicem purpurascente; anfractibus convexis, lineolis transversis
et longitudinalibus elevatis decussatis, anfractu ultimo ad basin sulcis impressis spiralibus
instructo; apertura ovata, antice subeffusa; labio vix reflexo.

Long. 1 inch, lat. 8 lines.

Habitat. King's Ponds, Arnhem's Land (Coll. Angas).

This is a neat, finely-decussated, concolorous species, with the upper whorls nodulous from
erosion, as in Vivipara praerosa, Gerst. It is named after Mr. Stephen King, one of the gentlemen
who accompanied the expedition.

3. Melania (Melasma) onca, Adams & Angas.

M. testa fusiformi-turrita; spira elata, conica; epidermide pallide olivaceo induta, rufo-fusca,
pulcherrime maculata, maculis saepe in lineis undulatis longitudinalibus dispositis; anfractibus
planis, longitudinaliter plicatis, plicis aequalibus regularibus subdistantibus, ad suturas
nodulosis; apertura oblongo-ovata, antice effusa; labio subincrassato; labro simplici, acuto.

Long. 1 inch, lat. 4 lines.

Habitat. Tributary of Adelaide River, Arnhem's Land (Coll. Angas).

A species remarkable both for the elegance of its form and the beauty of its painting. The
whorls are plicate, with a necklace-like series of nodules at the sutures; and the shell is
covered with dark red-brown spots, suggestive of its specific name.

4. Amphipeplea vinosa, Adams & Angas.

A. testa ovata; spira mediocri, tenui, semipellucida, vinosa; anfractu ultimo magno, ventricoso,
postice ad suturas gibboso; apertura ovata; labio callo tenui mediocri obtecto, columella spiraliter
tortuosa; labro convexo, margine acuto.

Long. 9 lines, lat. The whorls are posteriorly gibbose or tumid at the sutures, and the callus
is less spreading than in others of the genus.

5. Amphipeplea phillipsi, Adams & Angas.

A. testa ovata; spira elata, acuta, tenui, cornea; anfractu ultimo magno, non ventricoso, transversim
creberrime striato; apertura oblongo-ovali; labio callo tenui expanso obtecto; labro simplici,
acuto.

Long. 9 lines, lat. 4 lines.

Habitat. Arnhem's Land (Coll. Angas).

A neat, horn-coloured, finely transversely striated species, with an acute elevated spire.
We have named it after Mr. T. Phillips, who has assiduously collected many new Australian shells.

6. Physa newcombi, Adams & Angas.

P. testa ovata, umbilicata; spira mediocri, acuta, ad apicem integra, cornea, viridescente
aut pallide fulva; anfractibus quinque, convexis, saepe plus minusve transversim subliratis;
apertura ovata; labio reflexo, umbilicum partim tegente; labro vix incrassato, peristomate
nigrescente.

Long. 10 lines, lat. 7 lines.

Habitat. Ponds at Mount Margaret (Coll. Angas.)

We have much pleasure in naming this noble Physa after Dr. Newcomb, the distinguished American
conchologist, who has contributed so much, by his researches in the Sandwich Islands, to our
knowledge of the genus Helicter or Achatinella. The species is widely umbilicated, and the
peristome is usually dark-coloured.

7. Physa ferruginea, Adams & Angas.

P. testa ovata, rimata, ferruginea; spira mediocri, apice eroso; anfractibus tribus, convexis,
simplicibus, transversim crebre crenato-striatis; apertura ovata, intus purpurascente; labio
tenui, late reflexo; labro acuto.

Long. 5 lines, lat. 4 lines.

Habitat. Arnhem's Land, North-west Australia (Coll. Angas.)

This is a small ferruginous species, with the whorls finely transversely striated.

8. Physa badia, Adams & Angas.

P. testa elongato-ovata, imperforata, solida, badia; spira elata, apice obtuso eroso; anfractibus
quinque, convexiusculis, longitudinaliter strigillatis; apertura elongato-ovata; labio albo,
excavato, lirula antica subspirali instructo; labro arcuato, in medio producto, intus fusco tincto.

Long. 1 inch, lat. 6 lines.

Habitat. Tributaries of Adelaide River, Arnhem's Land (Coll. Angas.)

A fine, solid, brown species, generally more or less eroded, and with a peculiarly strongly
plicate columella.

9. Physa olivacea, Adams & Angas.

P. testa elongato-ovata, imperforata, solidiuscula, olivacea; spira elata, attenuata, apice
eroso; anfractibus quinque, convexiusculis; apertura ovato-acuta; labio incrassato, flexuoso;
labro acuto, margine arcuato.

Long. 6 lines, lat. 3 lines.

Habitat. Arnhem's Land (Coll. Angas.)

A neat, olive-coloured species, somewhat resembling in form the British Aplexa hypnorum, but
without the polished exterior of the latter.

10. Physa concinna, Adams & Angas.

11. Physa (Ameria) reevii, Adams & Angas.

P. testa ovali, postice abrupte truncata, imperforata, cornea; spira plana, tenui; anfractibus
quatuor, planis, ultimo permagno, postice acute angulato, transversim obsolete striato; apertura
oblongo-truncata; labio antice valde tortuoso; labro postice angulato.

Long. The last whorl is acutely angulate posteriorly, and the spire is tabulated, giving to
the shell a peculiar truncate appearance.

12. Physa (Ameria) bonus-henricus, Adams & Angas.

P. testa ovata, rimata, tenui, cornea; spira vix elata, plana; anfractibus tribus, planis,
postice angulatis, ultimo magno, inflato, ventricoso, postice subangulato, longitudinaliter
plus minusve plicato; apertura ovata; labio tenui, subtortuoso; labro simplici, margine arcuato.

Long. 4 lines, lat. 2 1/2 lines.

Habitat. Arnhem's Land (Coll. Angas.)

This is a small inflated species, with a short truncate spire. We have dedicated it to the
founder of the section Ameria, a gentleman well known for his deep researches in conchology.

13. Unio (Alasmodon) stuarti, Adams & Angas.

U. testa transversim elongato-ovata, tenui, compressa, epidermide olivaceo-fusca induta, postice
corrugato-plicata, latere antico breviore rotundato, postico longiore oblique subtruncato,
margine ventrali regulariter arcuato; umbonibus parvis, erosis, dentibus cardinalibus elongatis
valde divergentibus, postico bifido, antico prominulo; intus iridescente.

Alt. 1 1/2 inch, lat. 3 inches 2 lines.

Habitat. Lagoon, Mount Margaret, Central Australia (Coll. Angas.)

This species, which we have named after Mr. J. McD. Stuart, the leader of the expedition, is
the only Naiad, besides Alasmodon angasana of Lea, yet discovered in the regions traversed
by the explorers.
