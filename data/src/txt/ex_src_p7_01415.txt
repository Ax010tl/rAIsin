CRICKET.

There is no truth in the rumour that spectacular cricket is to be resumed. It is perfectly
true that a section of the public who are devoted to watching the game and cannot understand
why, because the nations happen to be at war, this favourite summer recreation should be denied
them, have been agitating for the Government to arrange with the War Office to release all
first-class cricketers now in the Forces, so that they may be free to play matches at home.
It is also true that the Government, having refused to do this, subsequently, in view of the
arguments urged by a deputation of cricket enthusiasts, agreed to do so, since it has always
set its face against any pedantic rigidity of purpose. But none the less no such matches will
be played, for the simple reason that the cricketers themselves refuse to come back until their
job is finished.

THE BALLAD OF JONES'S BLIGHTY.

  There are some men who dwell for years
    Within the battle's hem,
  Almost impervious, it appears,
    To shot or stratagem;
  Some well-intentioned sprite contrives
  By hook or crook to save their lives
  (It also keeps them from their wives),
    And Jones was one of them.

  The hugest bolts of Messrs. KRUPP
    Hissed harmless through his hair;
  The Bosch might blow his billet up,
    But he would be elsewhere;
  And if with soul-destroying thud
  A monstrous Minnie hit the mud,
  The thing was sure to be a dud
    If only Jones was there.

  Men envied him his scatheless skin,
    But he deplored the fact,
  And day by day, from sheer chagrin,
    He did some dangerous act;
  He slew innumerable Huns,
  He captured towns, he captured guns;
  His friends went home with Blighty ones,
    But he remained intact.

  We had a horse of antique shape,
    Mild and of mellowed age,
  And, after some unique escape,
    Which made him mad with rage,
  On this grave steed Jones rode away...
  They bore him back at break of day,
  And Jones is now with Mrs. J.--
    The convalescent stage.

  The world observed the chance was droll
    That sent so mild a hack
  To smite the invulnerable soul
    Whom WILLIAM could not whack;
  But spiteful folk remarked, of course,
  He must have used terrific force
  Before he got that wretched horse
    To throw him off its back.

ANOTHER IMPENDING APOLOGY.

    "Many coolies of the savage tribes from the hilly places, who have
    been enlisted for the labour corps, were seen passing this town by
    train lately. Some had too few clothes. Our late Chief Secretary,
    the Hon'ble Mr. ----, was seen among them."--Times of Assam.

    "All can sympathise with Mr. ---- and his teetotal party in
    deploring the excesses of 'liquor' of any description, and the
    vice, want and misery it brings in its course. But we cannot for a
    single moment listen to their selfish and pitiful beatings, when
    we know that if their methods were carried out through the land
    it would people our beloved country with a virile race of effete
    degenerates."--Provincial Paper.

"Virile" is good, and should encourage the teetotalers to proceed with their "beatings."

AN IDEAL MEDICAL BOARD.

(A DREAM OF THE FUTURE.)

I was due to go in front of the local Medical Board next morning, and I was seeking distraction
in the evening paper. Suddenly my eye was caught by the headlines announcing the transfer of
recruiting arrangements from the Military to the Civil authorities. This promised to be interesting.

All at once the room grew misty, and when the atmosphere cleared again I found myself in the
open street. Before me was a palatial building with the words "Medical Board" carved on a marble
slab over the main entrance.

I entered, and was immediately confronted by a liveried janitor who bowed obsequiously.

"I have come to be medically examined," I explained.

"Yes, Sir," he replied. "Will you be good enough to wait one moment, Sir, while I settle with
your taxi-driver, and then I will take you to the waiting-room, Sir."

"I have no taxi," I said. "I just walked."

An expression of concern passed across his face.

"Oh, you shouldn't have done that, Sir. The Authorities don't like it. There is a special fund
for such expenses, you know, Sir. Will you please come this way, Sir?"

I followed him along the corridor, and was shown into a luxurious apartment overlooking a pleasant
garden. The janitor placed an easy chair in position for me, handed me a copy of Punch, and
brought me a glass of wine and some biscuits.

"Now, Sir, if you will give me your papers I will send them up to the Board."

I handed the packet to him, and he left the room.

A few minutes later a message-girl entered.

"Are you Mr. Smith?" she inquired.

I confessed that I was, upon which she handed me a sealed envelope. I opened it, and found
a letter and a cheque for five pounds. The letter ran as follows:--

"SIR,--The above-named Medical Board regrets its inability to examine you to-day. As you are
no doubt aware, it is contrary to its rule to examine more than three persons in one day, and
an unusually difficult case, held over from yesterday, has upset all its arrangements.

"The Board would consider it a favour if you could make it convenient to call again to-morrow
morning at the same time.

"The enclosed cheque is intended to compensate you for the unnecessary trouble to which you
have been put.

"Your obedient Servants ----"

Punctually at the time appointed I again entered the building, and was met by the same janitor.

"The Board is quite ready for you, Sir," he said. "Will you please ascend to the dressing-room,
Sir?"

He committed me to the care of a lift-girl, who conveyed me to the second storey. Here I was
handed over to a smart valet, who assisted me to undress in a comfortable little apartment
replete with every convenience.

Having donned a warm dressing-gown, I was conducted to the Board Room, where I found a dozen
of our greatest Specialists assembled. The President shook hands and greeted me effusively.
Then I passed in turn from one Doctor to another, each making, with the utmost delicacy and
consideration, a thorough examination of that part of my anatomy on which he was an acknowledged
expert.

When this was over I was invited to retire to the dressing-room and resume my garments while
the Board held a protracted consultation on my case. On returning to the Board Room I was provided
with a seat, and the President addressed me.

"Well, Mr. Smith, we can find nothing constitutionally wrong with you. But tell me, have you
ever had any serious illness?"

I shook my head. I had always been abnormally healthy.

"Think carefully," he urged. "We don't want to pass you as fit if we can help it."

He seemed so anxious that I felt ashamed to disappoint him.

"Well," I replied, "the only thing I can call to mind is that, according to my mother, I had
a severe teething rash when I was ten months old."

As I uttered these words the faces of all became suddenly grave.

"That is quite enough, Mr. Smith," said the President. "You are given total exemption. You
should never have been brought here at all, but I am sure you will realise that in times of
national emergency mistakes of this nature are bound to occur. If you will apply to the Cashier
on your way out he will give you a draft for twenty pounds, to reimburse you in some small
way for the loss of your valuable time. Good-bye!"

He held out his hand, but before I could grasp it a mist again enveloped me, from which I emerged
upon the dreadful facts of life.

BALLAD OF THE POTATO.

  Above three hundred years ago
    To Britain's shores there came
  An immigrant of lineage low--
    Sol Tuberose his name.

  He settled down in mean estate,
    Despised on every side,
  Until at last he waxéd great,
    Grew rich and multiplied.

  Now none so popular as he;
    To every house he goes,
  At every table he must be--
    The great Sol Tuberose!

  In time of war he proves his worth
    He helps us everywhere;
  There's nothing on (or in) this earth
    That can with him compare.

  Not the great LLOYD could save the land
    Except for mighty Sol;
  For he is Bread's twin-brother--and
    He gives us Alcohol;

  Not such as fills the toper's tum,
    But such as fills the shell--
  Such as will be in days to come
    Heat, light, and pow'r as well.

  Yes, in the spacious days to come
    We'll bless Sol Tuberose,
  When all our motor engines hum
    On what the farmer grows.

  Then cultivate him all you can,
    With him and his stand well in;
  There's one that is a Nobleman,
    There's one Sir John Llewellyn.

  There's one that is a British Queen,
    There's one a dwarf, Ashleaf,
  There's one that is a plain Colleen,
    There's one an Arran Chief.

  He'll serve us if we do him well
    (Last year he failed our foes).
  Oh, who can all the praises tell
    Of good Sol Tuberose!

A CENTENARY.

JOHN LEECH.

BORN AUGUST 29TH, 1817.

I.--TO OUR GREATEST CONTRIBUTOR.

  JOHN LEECH, a hundred years ago,
    When you were born and after,
  There shone a sort of kindly glow
    Of airy fun and laughter;
  It was a sound that seemed to sing,
    A universal humming
  That made the echoing rafters ring
    And so proclaimed your coming.

  It was not noted at the time:
    I was not there to note it,
  But now I set it down in rhyme
    That other men may quote it
  And still maintain the thing is true,
    Defying Wisdom's strictures,
  And lose all doubt by looking through
    A book of LEECH'S pictures.

  You drew our English country-folk
    As many others saw them--
  The simple life, the simple joke,
    But only you could draw them;
  The warp and woof of country joys
    In green and pleasant places;
  The mischievous and merry boys,
    The girls with shining faces.

  The Squires, the Centaurs of the chase
    And all the chase's patrons,
  Each in his own, his ordered place;
    The comfortable matrons--
  These were your stuff, and these your skill
    Consigned to future ages,
  And caught and set them down at will
    In Mr. Punch's pages.

  Besides, you bound us to your praise
    With many strong indentures
  By limning Mr. Briggs, his ways
    And countless misadventures.
  For these and many a hundred more,
    Far as our voice can reach, Sir,
  We send it out from shore to shore,
    And bless your name, JOHN LEECH, Sir.

  R.C.L.

II.--HISTORIAN AND PROPHET.

A hundred years ago to the very day was JOHN LEECH born. Mr. Punch came into the world on July
17th, 1841, and was thus twenty-four years younger. But in spite of any disparity in age the
two great men were made for each other. JOHN LEECH without Mr. Punch would still have spread
delight, for did he not illustrate those Handley Cross novels which his friend THACKERAY said
he would rather have written than any of his own books? But to think of Mr. Punch without JOHN
LEECH is, as the Irishman said, unthinkable. From the third volume, when LEECH got really into
his stride, until his lamented early death in 1864, LEECH'S genius was at the service of his
young friend: his quick perceptive kindly eyes ever vigilant for humorous incident, his ears
alert for humorous sayings, and his hand translating all into pictorial drama and by a sure
and benign instinct seizing always upon the happiest moment.

His three monumental volumes called Pictures of Life and Character constitute a truer history
of the English people in the middle of the last century than any author could have composed:
history made gay with laughter, but history none the less. And this leaves out of account altogether
the artist's work as a cartoonist, where he often exceeded the duty of the historian, and not
only recorded the course of events but actually influenced it.

To influence the course of events was however far from being this simple gentleman's ambition.
What he chiefly wished was to enable others to share his own enjoyment in the fun and foibles
of a world in which it is better to be cheerful than sad, and, in the process of passing on
his amusement, to earn a sufficient livelihood to enable him to pay his way and now and then
be free to follow the hounds.

All these praises he would probably wish unsaid, so modest and unassuming was he. Let us therefore
stop and merely draw attention to the two pages of his drawings which follow, each of which
shows JOHN LEECH in the light of a prophet.

A BALLAD OF EELS.

    ["Lord Desborough has just been reminding us of the neglected
    source of food supply that we have in the eels of our rivers and
    ponds. He stated, 'The food value of an eel is remarkable. In food
    value one pound of eels is better than a loin of beef.... The
    greatest eel-breeding establishment in the world is at Comacchio,
    on the Adriatic. This eel nursery is a gigantic swamp of 140 miles
    in circumference. It has been in existence for centuries, and in
    the sixteenth century it yielded an annual revenue of £1,200 to
    the Pope.'"--Liverpool Daily Post.]

  When lowering clouds refuse to lift
    And spread depression far and wide,
  And when the need of strenuous thrift
    Is loudly preached on every side,
  What boundless gratitude one feels
    To DESBOROUGH, inspiring chief,
  For telling us: "One pound of eels
    Is better than a loin of beef"

  Of old, Popes made eel-breeding pay
    (At least Lord DESBOROUGH says they did),
  And cleared per annum in this way
    Twelve hundred jingling, tingling quid.
  In fact my brain in anguish reels
    To think we never took a leaf
  Out of the book which taught that eels
    Are better than prime cuts of beef.

  In youth, fastidiously inclined,
    I own with shame that I eschewed,
  Like most of my unthinking kind,
    This luscious and nutritious food;
  But now that DESBOROUGH reveals
    Its value, with profound belief
  I sing with him: "One pound of eels
    Is better than a loin of beef."

  I chant it loudly in my bath,
    I chant it when the sun is high,
  And when the moon pursues her path
    Noctambulating through the sky.
  And when the bill of fare at meals
    Is more than usually brief,
  Again I sing: "One pound of eels
    Is better than a loin of beef."

  It is a charm that never fails
    When friends accost me in the street
  And utter agonizing wails
    About the price of butcher's meat.
  "Cheer up," I tell them, "creels on creels
    Are hastening to your relief;
  Cheer up, my friends, one pound of eels
    Is better than a loin of beef."

  Then all ye fearful folk, dismayed
    By threatened shortage of supplies,
  Let not your anxious hearts be swayed
    By croakers or their dismal cries;
  But, from Penzance to Galashiels,
    From Abertillery to Crieff,
  Remember that "one pound of eels
    Is better than a loin of beef."

  But these are only pleasant dreams
    Unless, to realise our hopes,
  Proprietors of ponds and streams
    Re-stock them, like the early Popes.
  Then, though we still run short of keels
    And corn be leaner in the sheaf,
  We shall at least have endless eels,
    Unnumbered super-loins of beef.

"BILLETED."

No wonder the Royalty Management, realising how resolutely determined the public was to have
nothing to do with anything so witty and workmanlike as The Foundations of Mr. GALSWORTHY,
have for their new bill declined upon the pleasantly trivial comedy of errors and tarradiddles,
Billeted.
