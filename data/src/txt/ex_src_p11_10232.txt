     It cannot have escaped your observation, how many persons there
     are who continue the hateful practice of enslaving their fellow
     men, and who acquiesce in the sophistry of the advocates of that
     practice, merely from want of reflection, and from an habitual
     attention to their own immediate interest. If to such were often
     applied the force of reason, and the persuasion of eloquence,
     they might be awakened to a sense of their injustice, and be
     startled with horror at the enormity of their conduct. To produce
     so desirable a change in sentiment, as well as practice, we
     recommend to you the instituting of annual, or other periodical,
     discourses, or orations, to be delivered in public, on the
     subject of slavery, and means of its abolition.

     By a decree of the National Convention of France, all the blacks
     and people of color, within the territories of the French
     republic, are declared free, and entitled to an equal
     participation of the rights of citizens of France. They have the
     pleasure to assure you, that every successive meeting evinces the
     importance of that union and concert which are so happily
     established among the several Societies, in pursuing the great
     object of their association.

     But, although the exertions of this delegated Body have been
     hitherto attended, as we hope, with considerable
     success--Although we are persuaded that no small progress may be
     marked in the great business of emancipation; yet much remains to
     be done; as long as seven hundred thousand of our Fellow
     Creatures, in the United States, continue in a state of bondage,
     there appears a pressing necessity for the continuance of our
     efforts; that we should keep our attention fixed upon the
     subject, and stand ready to improve every favorable opportunity
     that may occur, to forward the interesting cause in which we are
     engaged. We are therefore induced to continue the recommendation
     heretofore made, that a similar meeting be annually held; and as
     convening at the present season is attended with inconveniences,
     we propose, that the next Convention, should assemble in this
     city, on the first Wednesday of May, in the year 1797.

     It gives us pleasure to learn, from various reports which were
     laid before us, that most of the recommendations made by the
     former Conventions, had received a considerable degree of
     attention, from the several societies to whom they were
     addressed. But, as they have not been uniformly and perfectly
     complied with, permit us to repeat the request, so far as the
     same may be applicable to your society, that you transmit to the
     next Convention, certified copies of all such laws, in any wise
     respecting slavery, as are now in force, as have been repealed,
     or may hereafter be enacted--Correct lists of the officers of
     your society, for the time being, and also the names of all your
     members, and their places of abode--An account of the proceedings
     of your society, in relieving Africans and others unlawfully held
     in bondage--A statement of the condition of the blacks, both bond
     and free, in your state, with respect to the property of the
     free, and the employment and moral conduct of all--Reports of
     such trials and decisions of the Courts of Judicature, relative
     to Africans, as may have taken place--An account of the endeavors
     which have been used to obtain a repeal or amelioration of the
     laws respecting slavery--information concerning what has been
     done, in pursuance of the recommendation of the last Convention,
     to establish periodical discourses on the subject of slavery, and
     the means of its abolition--And finally, a report of the progress
     you have made in extending to Africans the benefits of education.
     And we further request, that whatever communications may be made
     to the next, or to any future Convention, in consequence of the
     above recommendations, be presented in the form of regular
     written reports, noticing in what manner and degree you have
     carried them into effect, and how far your efforts have been
     ineffectual. By this means there will be exhibited such a view of
     the state of each Society, as that the several reports may be
     entered on the minutes of the Convention, who will thereby be
     better enabled to decide on the propriety of making public such
     parts of these communications as may be best adapted to advance
     the cause of truth and humanity.

     And as very important advantages have, in several instances,
     resulted from accurate registers being kept, by persons appointed
     for that purpose by certain of the Abolition Societies in the
     United States, of such manumissions as have taken place; we do
     earnestly recommend, should you not already have entered into
     this regulation, that you make it hereafter an object of diligent
     attention. Such records may, in various ways, subserve the cause
     of emancipation.

     We learn, that the proposal made by the last Convention,
     respecting the blacks, and people of color, who have emigrated
     from the West Indies, and now reside in the United States, has,
     in many instances, given rise to difficulty; in order to remove
     which, we have been induced to transmit to you the following
     extract from the twelfth article of the Consular Convention
     between France and the United States; which by designating the
     proper tribunals to whom application, in such cases, is to be
     made, will, we trust, be found sufficient, in future, to direct
     your proceedings in this business, viz.

     When we contemplate the odious nature and the immense magnitude
     of the evil which you have associated to oppose, and the
     inestimable importance of the objects which you are seeking to
     obtain, we cannot forbear to urge unremitted exertions, in
     pursuing the great ends before you. We are persuaded you will not
     neglect any just means in your power, which may tend to advance,
     either directly, or indirectly, the cause of equal liberty;--And
     it gives us pleasure also to express our persuasion, that, in
     this pursuit, much is still in your power. Although you cannot
     control Legislatures; and though, when you plead the cause of
     humanity, they will not, at all times, listen to you; yet there
     are other means to be used, perhaps, more effectual--You can do
     much, by directing your efforts to the conviction of
     individuals--by diffusing proper publications amongst them, and
     by presenting the evils of slavery in various forms to their
     minds.[3]

     The following was inserted in the Address to the Pennsylvania
                           Abolition Society.

     And as precise information, on this subject, cannot be too
     generally diffused, we request you to collect all possible
     intelligence relative to such blacks and people of color in the
     United States as are made Citizens of the French Republic, by the
     decree of the National Convention, of the sixteenth Pluviose,
     second year of the republic, and transmit the same to all the
     other Abolition Societies in the United States.

     Nor can we suppose, it would be an effort altogether ineffectual
     in favor of liberty, were its friends, throughout the United
     States, in all cases where it is practicable, to display a marked
     preference of such commodities, as are of the culture or
     manufacture of freemen, to those which are cultivated or
     manufactured by slaves--In this way, every individual may
     discountenance oppression, and bear testimony against a practice,
     which is still suffered to remain the disgrace of our land.

     We have thought proper to address the free Africans and other
     free people of color in the United States, on various subjects,
     which we believe nearly to concern their interest and happiness.
     We have directed copies of this address to be transmitted to you
     and request you to distribute the same, in your State, in such
     manner as you may judge best calculated to promote its design.

     We cannot conclude, without calling your attention, in a
     particular manner, to the necessity of appointing such of your
     members to represent you in the Convention, as will be punctually
     attentive to the duties of their appointment. We are sorry to
     observe, that there is some ground of complaint, on this subject;
     but we trust, that, in future, such a full representation will
     appear, as will give encreasing encouragement, energy and success
     to our united endeavors in the great cause of human happiness.

     Copies of our proceedings will be laid before you; from which we
     hope, you will derive satisfaction, and perceive the importance
     of the several objects which we have recommended to your
     attention.[4]

     To the                                 Society for promoting the
                         Abolition of Slavery.

     To inform you of our proceedings; to solicit your further advice
     and assistance; and to request your special attention to the
     original object of our meetings, we now address you.

     We have, as formerly, gone through our business with harmony and
     satisfaction; the peculiar objects, thereof will appear from our
     minutes, herewith transmitted; and we can truly add, that the
     important advantages evidently arising from such a collection of
     information and exchange of sentiment are too obvious, not to
     unite us in the recommendation, that a similar Convention of
     delegates from the different abolition societies, be held in this
     city on the first day of June, 1798.

     The non-compliance of several societies with this proposal for
     some years past, induces us to believe that some obstacles may
     exist, which possibly might be removed; we therefore request,
     that where it is not agreed to send delegates, such societies
     would favor the Convention, in writing, with their determination
     and the causes of it. This better enables the Convention to judge
     of the most proper mode of proceeding in future.

     A table, containing the requisitions of this and the former
     Conventions, and how far they have hitherto been complied with by
     each society, will shew the propriety and necessity of fulfilling
     these requisitions; which, after being thus pointed out need not
     now be further insisted on.

     When we consider the extensive influence of education on society,
     we think a due attention to the instruction of the blacks and
     people of color of every description cannot be too forcibly
     impressed. This will apply not merely to what is called school
     learning, but essentially consists in inculcating the sound
     principles of morality and religion as well as habits of
     temperance and industry. From a continued regard to the welfare
     of this much injured and much oppressed people, we have again
     addressed them on such points as we judged would be most
     beneficial; but it will in a great degree rest with you to
     circulate and enforce the advice recommended: and we may add,
     that, as the evils which must necessarily result from their being
     retained in a state of ignorance are incalculable, so it is, in
     our opinion, the greatest and perhaps the only important service
     we can render to them and to our country, to disseminate learning
     and morality amongst them, thus raising them gradually and safely
     to that level, to which they must, in the course of time,
     inevitably attain.

     The different Conventions have from year to year, endeavoured to
     procure from the Abolition Societies, every kind of information
     which may illustrate the history of slavery in the United States;
     we now repeat their request, with a view to the formation of a
     history of this important subject.

     From the general accounts received, as well as from our own
     observations we are induced strongly to recommend, that where
     several Abolition Societies exist in one state, they would, if
     possible, form a general plan of union or confederation, so as,
     on all important occasions, to act in concert.

     You are already well informed of the act of Congress of March
     twenty-second, 1794, prohibiting the citizens of the United
     States from supplying foreign nations with slaves; you will also
     most probably have heard that this wise and humane law has been
     too frequently violated by our citizens; in consequence of which
     the Abolition Societies of Pennsylvania, New-York and Providence,
     have severally commenced prosecutions against divers persons and
     vessels, engaged in this abominable traffic; the first named
     society has been successful in the two prosecutions they
     undertook in the District Court of Pennsylvania and of the United
     States of America. The vessels have been condemned, and actions
     are pending against the masters and owners in the Circuit Court
     of the United States in and for the Pennsylvania district of the
     middle circuit. There is good ground to believe that the other
     societies will meet with equal success.

     Besides the information mutually given by the societies to each
     other as occasions may require, to assist them in checking such
     clandestine practices, we believe it would be highly useful to
     forward every particular that comes to your knowledge on this
     subject, to the next Convention, who may make a very important
     use of it.

     The difficulties which have continually occurred respecting the
     blacks and people of color, who have for several years past
     emigrated from the French West-Indies into the United States,
     have engaged the attention of this and the preceding Conventions.
     To remove these difficulties, we transmit you a certified copy of
     an authenticated decree of the National Convention of France, of
     the sixteenth Pluviose, second year of the Republic; (February
     fifth, 1794,) which has been lately received by the Pennsylvania
     Abolition Society. With this decree, since fully confirmed by the
     French constitution of 1795, we believe you will have it in your
     power to afford every legal and effectual assistance to these
     unfortunate people.

     There yet remains a subject which, though often urged, still
     continues to demand our serious attention; we allude to the most
     proper means of extending the principles of just and equal
     liberty amongst mankind: and as we profess to assume no other
     powers than those of persuasion and convincement, founded on the
     unerring basis of truth and justice, we wish you duly to advert
     to the magnitude of the cause in which we are engaged, to
     persevere with patience and fortitude in your applications to
     legislative bodies and courts of justice, for the relief of our
     unfortunate African brethren, and to continue to enlighten the
     public mind, by spreading as much as possible, all kind of useful
     information on the subject: that thus we may, in every form, and
     on every occasion, be ready to plead the cause of the oppressed,
     in the language of persuasion and of truth.

     The assembling in Convention, at proper intervals, has produced
     so many advantages in combining the views and operations of the
     friends of emancipation throughout the United States, that we are
     persuaded you will unite with us in opinion, that it is expedient
     that another Convention of delegates from the several Abolition
     Societies, be held in this city on the first Wednesday of June,
     in the year one thousand eight hundred.

     The alteration in the period of meeting we have adopted under a
     consideration of the peculiar situation of our country, and the
     state of the objects which have hitherto occupied our attention;
     but, we earnestly request, that a general representation, and a
     punctual attendance, may take place at the time recommended.

     Although, from the reports of such of the Societies as have sent
     delegates to this Convention, we have observed, with
     encouragement and pleasure, the perseverance that is used, and
     the progress that is made, in the great work for which we have
     associated; yet, we cannot help noticing, with regret, the
     absence of many of our members, and the total omission of several
     of the Societies to appoint Representatives, or to comply with
     the request of the last Convention, that, where it was not agreed
     to send delegates, such determination and the cause of it might
     be reported to the Convention in writing. To those societies,
     therefore, which have failed in this respect, we are induced
     earnestly to repeat the request, and to urge their particular
     attention thereto.

     By some of the Societies the general requisitions of former
     Conventions, have not yet been answered or complied with, and by
     others only in part. An accurate table of these requisitions, and
     the manner in which each Society had complied with them, was made
     out by the last Convention and forwarded to the different
     Abolition Societies. By a reference thereto, and to the report of
     the committee of this Convention, to whom the several
     communications were referred, which is included in the copy of
     our proceedings herewith transmitted to you, you will observe
     what yet remains to be done; and we hope you will be able to make
     complete returns to the succeeding Convention, together with such
     other information as may appear to you to be useful towards the
     important purpose of forming a history of the progress and state
     of slavery in the United States.

     Too much cannot be said on the necessity of a constant attention
     to the subject of education. To prepare the minds of our
     unfortunate African brethren for that condition of freedom and
     rank in society to which they must, sooner or later, arrive--to
     disseminate among them useful instruction on moral and religious
     subjects, and to use our utmost endeavours to have schools
     established, for the purpose of teaching them to read and write,
     ought, we conceive, to be the primary object of all the Abolition
     Societies. We also think it of importance, at this particular
     period, to impress upon the minds of those who are in bondage,
     the propriety of a quiet submission to the injunctions of their
     masters, assuring them that by such conduct they will be likely
     to experience not only the advantages of better treatment in
     their present situation, but also cause, perhaps, even their
     possessors to perceive the injustice that is attached to the
     principles of slavery.
