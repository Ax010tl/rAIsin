PREFACE

Students of Ralegh's career cannot complain of a dearth of materials. For thirty-seven years
he lived in the full glare of publicity. The social and political literature of more than a
generation abounds in allusions to him. He appears and reappears continually in the correspondence
of Burleigh, Robert Cecil, Christopher Hatton, Essex, Anthony Bacon, Henry Sidney, Richard
Boyle, Ralph Winwood, Dudley Carleton, George Carew, Henry Howard, and King James. His is a
very familiar name in the Calendars of Domestic State Papers. It holds its place in the archives
of Venice and Simancas. No family muniment room can be explored without traces of him. Successive
reports of the Historical Manuscripts Commission testify to the vigilance with which his doings
were noted. No personage in two reigns was more a centre for anecdotes and fables. They were
eagerly imbibed, treasured, and circulated alike by contemporary, or all but contemporary,
statesmen and wits, and by the feeblest scandal-mongers. A list comprising the names of Francis
Bacon, Sir John Harington, Sir Robert Naunton, Drummond of Hawthornden, Thomas Fuller, Sir
Anthony Welldon, Bishop Goodman, Francis Osborn, Sir Edward Peyton, Sir Henry Wotton, John
Aubrey, Sir William Sanderson, David Lloyd, and James Howell, is far from exhausting the number
of the very miscellaneous purveyors and chroniclers.

Antiquaries, from the days of John Hooker of Exeter, the continuer of Holinshed, Sir William
Pole, Anthony à Wood, and John Prince, to those of Lysons, Polwhele, Isaac D'Israeli, Payne
Collier, and Dr. Brushfield, have found boundless hunting-ground in his habits, acts, and motives.
Sir John Hawles, Mr. Justice Foster, David Jardine, Lord Campbell, and Spedding have discussed
the technical justice of his trials and sentences. No historian, from Camden and de Thou, to
Hume, Lingard, Hallam, and Gardiner, has been able to abstain from debating his merits and
demerits. From his own age to the present the fascination of his career, and at once the copiousness
of information on it, and its mysteries, have attracted a multitude of commentators. His character
has been repeatedly analysed by essayists, subtle as Macvey Napier, eloquent as Charles Kingsley.
There has been no more favourite theme for biographers. Since the earliest and trivial account
compiled by William Winstanley in 1660, followed by the anonymous and tolerably industrious
narrative attributed variously to John, Benjamin, and James, Shirley in 1677, and Lewis Theobald's
meagre sketch in 1719, a dozen or more lives with larger pretensions to critical research have
been printed, by William Oldys in 1736, Thomas Birch in 1751, Arthur Cayley in 1805, Sir Samuel
Egerton Brydges in 1813, Mrs. A.T. Thomson in 1830, Patrick Fraser Tytler in 1833, Robert Southey
in 1837, Sir Robert Hermann Schomburgk in 1848, C. Whitehead in 1854, S.G. Drake, of Boston,
U.S., in 1862, J.A. St. John in 1868, Edward Edwards in the same year, Mrs. Creighton in 1877,
and Edmund Gosse in 1886.

Almost every one of this numerous company, down even to bookmaking Winstanley the barber, has
shed light, much or little, upon dark recesses. By four, Oldys, Cayley, Tytler, and Edwards,
the whole learning of the subject, so far as it was for their respective periods available,
must be admitted to have been most diligently accumulated. Yet it will scarcely be denied that
there has always been room for a new presentment of Ralegh's personality. That the want has
remained unsatisfied after all the efforts made to supply it is to be imputed less to defects
in the writers, than to the intrinsic difficulties of the subject. Ralegh's multifarious activity,
with the width of the area in which it operated, is itself a disturbing element. It is confusing
for a biographer to be required to keep at once independent and in unison the poet, statesman,
courtier, schemer, patriot, soldier, sailor, freebooter, discoverer, colonist, castle-builder,
historian, philosopher, chemist, prisoner, and visionary. The variety of Ralegh's powers and
tendencies, and of their exercise, is the distinctive note of him, and of the epoch which needed,
fashioned, and used him. A whole band of faculties stood ready in him at any moment for action.
Several generally were at work simultaneously. For the man to be properly visible, he should
be shown flashing from more facets than a brilliant. Few are the pens which can vividly reflect
versatility like his. The temptation to diffuseness and irrelevancy is as embarrassing and
dangerous. At every turn Ralegh's restless vitality involved him in a web of other men's fortunes,
and in national crises. A biographer is constantly being beguiled into describing an era as
well as its representative, into writing history instead of a life. Within an author's legitimate
province the perplexities are numberless and distracting. Never surely was there a career more
beset with insoluble riddles and unmanageable dilemmas. At each step, in the relation of the
most ordinary incidents, exactness of dates, or precision of events, appears unattainable.
Fiction is ever elbowing fact, so that it might be supposed contemporaries had with one accord
been conspiring to disguise the truth from posterity. The uncertainty is deepened tenfold when
motives have to be measured and appraised. Ralegh was the best hated personage in the kingdom.
On a conscientious biographer is laid the burden of allowing just enough, and not too much,
for the gall of private, political, and popular enmity. He is equally bound to remember and
account, often on the adverse side, for inherent contradictions in his hero's own moral nature.
While he knows it would be absurdly unjust to accept the verdict of Ralegh's jealous and envious
world on his intentions, he has to beware of construing malicious persecution as equivalent
to proof of angelic innocence.

One main duty of a biographer of Ralegh is to be strenuously on the guard against degenerating
into an apologist. But, above all, he ought to be versed in the art of standing aside. While
explanations of obscurities must necessarily be offered, readers should be put into a position
to judge for themselves of their sufficiency, and to substitute, if they will, others of their
own. Commonly they want not so much arguments, however unegotistical and dispassionate, as
a narrative. They wish to view and hear Ralegh himself; to attend him on his quick course from
one field of fruitful energy to another; to see him as his age saw him, in his exuberant vitality;
not among the few greatest, but of all great, Englishmen the most universally capable. They
desire facts, stated as such, simply, in chronological sequence, and, when it is at all practicable,
in the actor's own words, not artificially carved, coloured, digested, and classified. As for
failings and infirmities, they are more equitable and less liable to unreasonable disgusts
than a biographer is inclined to fancy. They are content that a great man's faults, real or
apparent, should be left to be justified, excused, or at all events harmonized, in the mass
of good and ill.

No biographer of Ralegh need for lack of occupation stray from the direct path of telling his
readers the plain story of an eventful life. The rightful demands on his resources are enough
to absorb the most plentiful stores of leisure, patience, and self-denial. He should be willing
to spend weeks or months on loosing a knot visible to students alone, which others have not
noticed, and, if they had, would think might as profitably have been left tied. He should collect,
and weigh, and have the courage to refuse to use, piles of matter which do not enlighten. He
should be prepared to devote years to the search for a clue to a career with a bewildering
capacity for sudden transformation scenes. He should have the courage, when he has lost the
trace, to acknowledge that he has wandered. He should feel an interest so supreme in his subject,
in its shadows as in its lights, as neither to count the cost of labour in its service, nor
to find affection for the man incompatible with the condemnation of his errors. Finally, after
having arrived at a clear perception of the true method to be pursued, and ends to be aimed
at, he should be able to recognize how very imperfectly he has succeeded in acting up to his
theory.

AUTHORITIES

Not a few readers and critics, who have been so kind as to speak otherwise only too favourably
of the book, have intimated that its value would be increased by references to the authorities.

In compliance with the suggestion, the author now prints the list--a formidable one. He has
drawn it up in a form which, he hopes, may enable students without much difficulty to trace
the sources of the statements in the text.

The figures in the parentheses () after the title of each authority are the date of the original
edition, where that is not the one cited. The figures which follow give the date of the edition
actually referred to. The brackets [] after the pages of the Life contain the pages, or volumes
and pages, of the cited works.
