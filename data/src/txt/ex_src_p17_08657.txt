[423] Some, and perhaps not a few of their objects, may have been imaginary "dream-mistresses,"
created by Morpheus in an impurer mood than when he created Lamb's "dream-children." But some,
I believe, have been identified; and others of the singular "Calendar" affixed to Monsieur
Nicolas have probably escaped identification.

[Sidenote: His life and the reasons for giving it.]

[424] It has not been necessary (and this is fortunate, for even if it had been necessary,
it would have been scarcely possible) to give biographies of the various authors mentioned
in this book, except in special cases. Something was generally known of most of them in the
days before education received a large E, with laws and rates to suit: and something is still
in a way, supposed to be known since. But of the life of Pigault, who called himself Lebrun,
it may be desirable to say something, for more reasons than one. In the first place, this life
had rather more to do with his work than is always the case; in the second, very little will
be found about him in most histories of French literature; in the third, there will be found
assigned to him, in the text--not out of crotchet, or contumacy, or desire to innovate, but
as a result of rather painful reading--a considerably higher place in the history of the novel
than he has usually occupied. His correct name--till, by one of the extremest eccentricities
of the French Chats-Fourrés, he was formally unbegot by his Roman father, and the unbegetting
(plus declaration of death) confirmed by the Parlement of Paris--was the imposing one of Charles
Antoine Guillaume Pigault de L'Épinoy. The paternal Pigault, as may be guessed from his proceedings,
was himself a lawyer, but of an old Calais family tracing itself to Queen Philippa's protégé,
Eustache de Saint-Pierre; and, besides the mysterious life-in-death or death-in-life, Charles
Antoine Guillaume had to suffer from him, while such things existed, several lettres de cachet.
The son certainly did his best to deserve them. Having been settled, on leaving school as a
clerk in an English commercial house, he seduced his master's daughter, ran away with her,
and would no doubt have married her--for Pigault was never a really bad fellow--if she had
not been drowned in the vessel which carried the pair back to France. He escaped--one hopes
not without trying to save her. After another scandal--not the second only--of the same kind,
he did marry the victim, and the marriage was the occasion of the singular exertion of patria
potestas referred to above. At least two lettres de cachet had preceded it, and it is said
that only the taking of the Bastille prevented the issue, or at least the effect, of a third.
Meanwhile, he had been a gentleman-trooper in the gendarmerie d'élite de la petite maison du
roi, which, seeing that the roi was Louis Quinze, probably did not conduct itself after the
fashion of the Thundering Legion, or of Cromwell's Ironsides, or even of Captain Steele's "Christian
Hero." The life of this establishment, though as probably merry, was not long, and Pigault
became an actor--a very bad but rather popular actor, it was said. Like other bad actors he
wrote plays, which, if not good (they are certainly not very cheerful to read), were far from
unsuccessful. But it was not till after the Revolution, and till he was near forty, that he
undertook prose fiction; his first book being L'Enfant du Carnaval in 1792 (noticed in text).
The revolutionary fury, however, of which there are so many traces in his writings, caught
him; he went back to soldiering and fought at Valmy. He did not stay long in the army, but
went on novel-writing, his success having the rather unexpected, and certainly very unusual,
effect of reconciling his father. Indeed, this arbitrary parent wished not only to recall him
to life, which was perhaps superfluous, but to "make an eldest son of him." This, Pigault,
who was a loose fish and a vulgar fellow, but, as was said above, not a scoundrel, could not
suffer; and he shared and shared alike with his brothers and sisters. Under the Empire he obtained
a place in the customs, and held it under succeeding reigns till 1824, dying eleven years later
at over eighty, and having written novels continuously till a short time before his death,
and till the very eve of 1830. This odd career was crowned by an odd accident, for his daughter's
son was Émile Augier. I never knew this fact till after the death of my friend, the late Mr.
H. D. Traill. If I had, I should certainly have asked him to write an Imaginary Conversation
between grandfather and grandson. Some years (1822-1824) before his last novel, a complete
edition of novels, plays, and very valueless miscellanies had been issued in twenty octavo
volumes. The reader, like the river Iser in Campbell's great poem, will be justified for the
most part in "rolling rapidly" through them. But he will find his course rather unexpectedly
delayed sometimes, and it is the fact and the reasons of these delays which must form the subject
of the text.--There is no doubt that Pigault was very largely read abroad as well as at home.
We know that Miss Matilda Crawley read him before Waterloo. She must have inherited from her
father, Sir Walpole, a strong stomach: and must have been less affected by the change of times
than was the case with her contemporary, Scott's old friend, who having enjoyed "your bonny
Mrs. Behn" in her youth, could not read her in age. For our poor maligned Afra (in her prose
stories at any rate, and most of her verse, if not in her plays) is an anticipated model of
Victorian prudery and nicety compared with Pigault. I cannot help thinking that Marryat knew
him too. Chapter and verse may not be forthcoming, and the resemblance may be accounted for
by common likeness to Smollett: but not, to my thinking, quite sufficiently.

[425] He had a younger brother, in a small way also a novelist, and, apparently, in the Radcliffian
style, who extra-named himself rather in the manner of 1830--Pigault-Maubaillarck. I have not
yet come across this junior's work.--For remarks of Hugo himself on Pigault and Restif, see
note at end of chapter.

[426] At least in his early books; it improves a little later. But see note on p. 453.

[427] For a defence of this word, v. sup. p. 280, note.

[428] It may be objected, "Did not the Scudérys and others do this?" The answer is that their
public was not, strictly speaking, a "public" at all--it was a larger or smaller coterie.

[429] It has been said that Pigault spent some time in England, and he shows more knowledge
of English things and books than was common with Frenchmen before, and for a long time after,
his day. Nor does he, even during the Great War, exhibit any signs of acute Anglophobia.

[430] Pigault's adoration for Voltaire reaches the ludicrous, though we can seldom laugh with
him. It led him once to compose one of the very dullest books in literature, Le Citateur, a
string of anti-Christian gibes and arguments from his idol and others.

[431] Yet sometimes--when, for instance, one thinks of the rottenness-to-the-core of Dean Farrar's
Eric, or the spiritus vulgaritatis fortissimus of Mark Twain's A Yankee at the Court of King
Arthur--one feels a little ashamed of abusing Pigault.

[432] There was, of course, a milder and perhaps more effective possibility--to make the young
turn to the young, and leave Madame de Francheville no solace for her sin. But for this also
Pigault would have lacked audacity.

[433] For the story "species" of Gil Blas was not new, was of foreign origin, and was open
to some objection; while the other two books just named derived their attraction, in the one
case to a very small extent, in the other to hardly any at all, from the story itself.

[434] Not that Jacob and Marianne are unnatural--quite the contrary--but that their situations
are conventionalised.

[435] Corps d'Extraits de Romans de Chevalerie. 4 vols. Paris, 1782.

[436] The link between the two suggested at p. 458, note, is as follows. That Victor Hugo should,
as he does in the Preface to Han d'Islande and elsewhere, sneer at Pigault, is not very wonderful:
for, besides the difference between canaille and caballería, the author of M. Botte was the
most popular novelist of Hugo's youth. But why he has, in Part IV. Book VII. of Les Misérables
selected Restif as "undermining the masses in the most unwholesome way of all" is not nearly
so clear, especially as he opposes this way to the "wholesomeness" of, among others--Diderot!

Roland and one or two other Chansons (possibly).

12TH CENTURY

Most of the older Chansons.

Arthurian Legend (in some of its forms).

Roman de Troie, Romans d'Alexandre (older forms).

13TH CENTURY

Rest of the more genuine Chansons.

Rest of ditto Arthuriad and "Matter of Rome."

Romans d'Aventures (many).

Early Fabliaux (probably).

Roman de la Rose and Roman de Renart (older parts).

Prose Stories (Aucassin et Nicolette), etc.

14TH CENTURY

Rehandlings, and younger examples, of all kinds above mentioned.

15TH CENTURY

Ditto, but only latest forms of all but Prose Stories, and many of the others rendered into prose.

Cent Nouvelles Nouvelles. First edition, 1480, but written much earlier.

Petit Jehan de Saintré, about 1459, or earlier.

Jehan de Paris. Uncertain, but before 1500.

16TH CENTURY

Rabelais. First Book of Pantagruel Second of the whole, 1533; Gargantua, 1535; rest of Pantagruel
at intervals, to the (posthumous) Fifth Book in 1564.

Marguerite de Navarre. Heptameron. Written before (probably some time before) Marguerite's
death in 1549. Imperfectly published as Les Amants Fortunés, etc., in 1558; completely, under
its permanent title, next year.

Bonaventure Despériers. Cymbalum Mundi, 1537; Contes et Joyeux Devis, 1558, but written at
least fourteen years earlier, as the author died in 1544.

Hélisenne de Crenne. Les Angoisses, etc., 1538.

Amadis Romances. Date of Spanish or Portuguese originals uncertain. Herberay published the
first part of his French translation of Amadis itself in 1540.

Many of the small pastoral and adventurous stories noticed at the beginning of Chapter VIII.
appeared in the last fifteen years of the sixteenth century, the remainder in the first quarter
of the seventeenth. But of the Greek and Spanish compositions, which had so great an influence
on them and on the subsequent "Heroic" School, the work of Heliodorus had been translated as
early as 1546, and the Diana of Montemayor in 1578.

17TH CENTURY

Honoré d'Urfé. L'Astrée, 1607-19. (First three parts in Urfé's lifetime, fourth and fifth after
his death in 1625.)

"Heroic" Romance, 1622-60, as regards its principal examples, the exact dates of which are
given in a note to p. 176. Madame de Villedieu wrote almost up to her death in 1683.

Fairy Tales, etc. The common idea that Perrault not only produced the masterpieces but set
the fashion of the kind is inexact. Madame d'Aulnoy's Contes des Fées appeared in 1682, whereas
Perrault's Contes de ma Mère L'Oye did not come till fifteen years later, in 1697. The precise
dates of the writing of Hamilton's Tales are not, I think, known. They must, for the most part,
have been between the appearance of Galland's Arabian Nights, 1704, and the author's death
in 1720. As for the Cabinet and its later constituents, see below on the eighteenth century.

Sorel, Ch. Francion, 1622; Le Berger Extravagant, 1627.

Scarron, P. Le Roman Comique, 1651.

Cyrano de Bergerac. Histoire Comique, etc., 1655.

Furetière, A. Le Roman Bourgeois, 1666.

La Fayette, Madame de. La Princesse de Clèves, 1678. Her first book, La Princesse de Montpensier
(much slighter but well written), had appeared eighteen years earlier, and Zaïde or Zayde in
1670, fathered by Segrais.

Fénelon. Télémaque, 1699.

18TH CENTURY

Cabinet des Fées, containing not only the authors or translators mentioned under the head of
the preceding century, but a series of later writings down to the eve of the Revolution. Gueulette's
adaptations and imitations ranged from the Soirées Bretonnes, published in 1712 during Hamilton's
lifetime, to the Thousand and One Hours, 1733, the other collections mentioned in the text
coming between. It may be worth mentioning that, being an industrious editor as well as tale-teller
and playwright, he reprinted Le Petit Jehan de Saintré in 1724 and Rabelais in 1732. Caylus's
tales seem to have been scattered over the middle third of the century from about 1730 to his
death in 1765. Cazotte's Diable Amoureux (not in the Cabinet) is of 1772--he had written very
inferior things of the tale kind full thirty years earlier. Mme. Le Prince de Beaumont (who
was long an actual governess in England) wrote her numerous "books for the young" for the most
part between 1757 (Le Magazin des Enfants) and 1774 (Contes Moraux).

Lesage. Le Diable Boiteux, 1707; Gil Blas de Santillane, 1715-35.

Marivaux. Les Effets Surprenants, 1713-14; Marianne, 1731-36; Le Paysan Parvenu, 1735.

Prévost. Mémoires d'un Homme de Qualité, 1728-32, followed by Manon Lescaut, 1733; Cléveland,
1732-39; Le Doyen de Killérine, 1735; Histoire d'une Grecque Moderne, 1741.

(It may not be impertinent to draw attention to the fact that Prévost, like Defoe--though not
quite to the same extent, and in the middle, not towards the end of his career--concentrated
the novel-part of an enormous polygraphic production upon a few years.)

Crébillon fils. Lettres de la Marquise, 1732; Tanzaï et Néadarné, 1734; Les Égarements, 1736;
Le Sopha, 1745; La Nuit et le Moment, 1755; Le Hasard au Coin du Feu, 1763; Ah! Quel Conte! 1764.

Voltaire's Tales were distributed over a large part of his long and insatiably busy life; but
none of his best are very early. Zadig is of 1747; Micromégas of 1752; Candide of 1759; L'Ingénu
and La Princesse de Babylone of 1767 and 1768 respectively.

Rousseau. La Nouvelle Héloïse, 1760; Émile, 1762.

Diderot. Les Bijoux Indiscrets, 1748. Jacques le Fataliste and La Religieuse were posthumously
published, but must have been written much earlier than their author's death in 1784.

Marmontel. Contes Moraux appeared in the official or semi-official Mercure de France, with
which the author was connected from 1753-60, being its manager or editor for the last two of
these years. Bélisaire came out in 1767.

Bernardin de Saint-Pierre. Paul et Virginie, 1787; La Chaumière Indienne, 1790.

"Sensibility" Novels:--

Madame de Tencin. Le Comte de Comminge, 1735; Les Malheurs de l'Amour, 1747.

Madame Riccoboni. Le Marquis de Cressy, 1758; Lettres de Julie Catesby, 1759; Ernestine, 1762.

Madame Élie de Beaumont. Le Marquis de Roselle, 1764.

Madame de Souza. Adèle de Senanges, 1794.

Madame de Genlis. Mlle. de Clermont, 1802.

Madame de Duras. Ourika, 1823; Édouard, 1825.

Xavier de Maistre. Voyage autour de ma Chambre, 1794; Le Lépreux de la Cité d'Aoste, 1812;
Les Prisonniers du Caucase, La Jeune Sibérienne, 1825.

Benjamin Constant. Adolphe, 1815.

Restif de la Bretonne. Le Pied de Fanchette, 1769; Adèle, 1772; Le Paysan Perverti, 1775-76;
Les Contemporaines, 1780-85; Ingénue Saxancour, 1789; Monsieur Nicolas, 1794-97.

Pigault-Lebrun. L'Enfant du Carnaval, 1792; Les Barons de Felsheim, 1798; Angélique et Jeanneton,
Mon Oncle Thomas, La Folie Espagnole, 1799; M. Botte, 1802; Jérôme, 1804; Tableaux de Société,
1813; Adélaïde de Méran, 1815; M. de Roberval, L'Officieux, 1818.

BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTES

(Although it is probably idle to attempt to satisfy or placate the contemporary helluo of bibliography,
it may be respectful to other readers to observe that this is not intended to deal with the
whole subject, but only as a companion, or chrestomathic guide, to this book itself.)

CHAPTER I

Apollonius of Tyre. Ed. Thorpe. London, 1834.

English Novel, The. By the present writer. London (Dent), 1913.

French Literature, A Short History of. By the present writer. Oxford, 1882, and often reprinted.

Greek Romances, The. Most convenient editions of originals--Didot's Erotici Graeci, Paris,
1856, or Teubner's, ed. Herscher, Leipzig, 1858. English translations in Bohn's Library. For
those who prefer books about things to the things themselves, there is a very good English
monograph by Wolff (Columbia University Series, New York).

Hymn of St. Eulalia. Quoted in most histories of French literature, e.g. that entered above,
pp. 4, 5.

Life of St. Alexis. Ed. G. Paris and L. Pannier. Paris, 1872-87.

CHAPTER II

Alexander Legends ("Matter of Rome").

Arthurian Legend, The. No complete bibliography of this is possible here--a note of some fulness
will be found in the writer's Short History (see above on Chapter I.).

Chansons de Gestes. The first sentence of the last entry applies here with greater fulness.
The editions of Roland are very numerous; and those of other chansons, though there are not
often two or more of the same, run to scores of volumes. The most important books about them
are M. Léon Gautier's Les Épopées Françaises (4 vols., Paris, 1892) and M. Bédier's Les Légendes
Épiques (4 vols., Paris, 1908-13).

Sainte-More, B. de. Roman de Troie. Ed. Joly. Rouen, 1870. Edited a second time in the series
of the Société des Anciens Textes Français.

CHAPTER III

The bibliography of the Romans d'Aventures generally is again too complicated and voluminous
to be attempted here. A fair amount of information will be found, as regards the two sides,
French and English, of the matter, in the writer's Short Histories of the two literatures--French
as above, English (Macmillan, 9th ed., London, 1914), and in his Romance and Allegory, referred
to in the text. Short of the texts themselves, but for fuller information than general histories
contain, Dunlop's well-known book, reprinted in Bohn's Library with valuable additions, and
Ellis's Early English Romances, especially the latter, will be found of greatest value.

Partenopeus de Blois. 2 vols. Paris, 1834.

CHAPTER IV

Nouvelles du 13'e et du 14'me Siècle. Ed. L. Moland et Ch. d'Héricault. Bibliothèque Elzévirienne.
2 vols. Paris, 1856.

CHAPTER V

Cent Nouvelles Nouvelles, Les. Numerous editions in the cheap collections of French classics.

Fabliaux. Ed. A. de Montaiglon et G. Raynaud. 6 vols. Paris, 1872-88.

Jehan de Paris. Ed. Montaiglon. Paris, 1874.

Petit Jehan de Saintré. Ed. Guichard. Paris, 1843.

Roman de la Rose. Ed. F. Michel. Paris, 1864.

Roman de Renart. The completest (but not a complete) edition of the different parts is that
of Méon and Chabaille (5 vols., Paris, 1826-35). The main or "Ancien" Renart was re-edited
by E. Martin (3 vols., Paris and Strasbourg, 1882-87).

CHAPTER VI

Rabelais. Editions of the original very numerous: and of Urquhart's famous English translation
more than one or two recently. The cheapest and handiest of the former, without commentary,
is that in the Collection Garnier. Of commentaries and books on Rabelais there is no end.

CHAPTER VII

Amadis Romances. No modern reprints of Herberay and his followers. Southey's English versions
of Amadis and Palmerin are not difficult to obtain.

Despériers, B. Contes et Joyeuse Devis, etc. Ed. Lacour. 2 vols. Paris, 1866.

Marguerite de Navarre, The Heptameron. Editions again numerous, including cheap ones in the
collections.

Moyen de Parvenir, Le. Ed. Jacob. Paris, 1860. (For Hélisenne de Crenne see text, and Reynier--v.
inf. on next chapter.)

CHAPTER VIII

The general histories and bibliographies of M. Reynier and Herr Körting, as well as the monographs
of MM. Chatenay, Magne, and Reure, will be found registered in the notes to text, and references
to them in the index. The original editions are also given in text or note. Modern reprints--except
of the fairy stories and one or two others--are almost entirely wanting. For the Greek Romances
see above under Chapter I. The Astrée, after its first issues, appeared as a whole in 1637
and 1647, the latter being the edition referred to in "Add. and Corr." But the later eighteenth-century
(1733) version of the Abbé Souchay is said to be "doctored." I have not thought it worth while
to look up either this or the earlier abridgment (La Nouvelle Astrée of 1713), though this
latter is not ill spoken of. For the Cabinet des Fées (41 vols., Geneva, 1785-89) see text.

CHAPTER IX

Sorel. Francion is in the Collection Garnier, Le Berger Extravagant and Polyandre only in the
originals.

Scarron. Le Roman Comique. The 1752 edition (3 vols.) is useful, but there are reprints.

Furetière. Le Roman Bourgeois. Collection Jannet et Picard, 1854.

Cyrano de Bergerac. Voyages, etc. Ed. Jacob. Paris, 1858. Paris, 1881.

CHAPTER X

For those who wish to study Lesage and Prévost at large, the combined Dutch Oeuvres Choisies,
in 54 vols. (Amsterdam, 1783), will offer a convenient, if not exactly handy, opportunity.
Separate editions of the Diable Boiteux and Gil Blas are very, and of Manon Lescaut fairly,
numerous.

Marivaux. Oeuvres. 12 vols. Paris, 1781.

Crébillon fils. Oeuvres Complètes. 7 vols. Londres, 1772.

CHAPTER XI

The work, in novel, of Voltaire and Rousseau is in all the cheap collections of Didot, Garnier,
etc. Of that of Diderot there have recently been several partial collections, but I think no
complete one. It is better to take the Oeuvres, by Assézat and Tourneux, mentioned in the text
(20 vols., Paris, 1875-77).

Marmontel's Oeuvres appeared in 19 vols. (Paris, 1818), and I have used, and once possessed,
a more modern and compacter issue in 7 vols. (Paris, 1820?). The Contes Moraux appeared together
in 1770 and later.

Bernardin de Saint-Pierre. Oeuvres. 12 vols. 1834. Very numerous separate editions (or sometimes
with La Chaumière Indienne) of Paul et Virginie.

CHAPTER XII

Minor "Sensibility" novels. Most of them in a handsome 7-vol. edition (Paris, n.d.) in Garnier's
Bibliothèque Amusante. This also includes Marivaux.

X. de Maistre. Editions numerous.

B. Constant. Adolphe. Paris, 1842; and with Introduction by M. Anatole France (1889); besides
M. de Lescure's noticed in text.

Restif de la Bretonne. Selection of Les Contemporaines, by Assézat. 3 vols. Paris, 1875-76.

Pigault-Lebrun. Edition mentioned in text.
